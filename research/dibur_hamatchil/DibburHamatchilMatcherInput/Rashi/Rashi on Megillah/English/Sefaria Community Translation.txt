Rashi on Megillah

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

The Megillah is read on the 11th etc... -  Sometimes on this and sometimes on this, and further it will be explained 
Not less and not more - Not before the 11th and not later than the 15th.  

Line 2

From the days of Yehoshua - In the Gemara it will be explained
But villages move forward to the day of entry - Which is to say, since the walled cities read on the 15th, and since the walled cities do not read on the 14th, behold in all, where is it found (that we read on) the 11th, the 12th, the 13th?  But the Sages gave to villages permission to push forward their reading to the day of entry.  The second day from Shabbat (Monday) which would fall before the 14th, or the fifth day from Shabbat (Thursday), which is a day of entry for the villages, whom enter into the cities for judgment (court cases) before the Beit Dinim (Courts) which dwell in the cities on Mondays and Thursday, as was decreed by Ezra (see Bava Kama page 82).  And the villages are not experts in reading, and need one of the men of the city to read for them, and the Sages didn't bother to make them come later, so they come on the day of the 14th and sometimes on the day of entry on the 13th and sometimes it is the 11th.

...A time of assembly - Everyone assembled to avenge from their enemies, whether in Shushan or other places as it is written in the book, therefore, the passuk does not need to include the 13th day as a day for reading the Megilla because the essence of the miracle happened on that day.

That all the time that Baruch son of Neriah lived, Ezra didn't leave him and Move to Israel (Make Aliyah) - That you have to wonder, why didn't Ezra make Aliyah with Zerubavel from the days of Coresh through the seventh year of Darius the Last, after the Beit Hamikdash was constructed as it is written in Ezra, "And he came to Yerushalaim in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king, etc." (Ezra 7), and in the Midrash, that he was learning Torah from the mouth of Baruch son of Neriah in Bavel, and Baruch did not move to Israel (Make Aliyah) and he died there during those years, and that which we say above, "Baruch prophesized in the year two of Darius in Bavel, he would prophesize and send books to Jerusalem:"

And also in that Parasha are the commands of the Second Tithe and the commands of Give, Ye  shall Give [Charity], and of Open, Ye Shall Open [Lending before the Seventh Year], and of Furnish, Ye Shall Furnish [Gifts to the Freed Slave], and of Sending Him Away Without Charge, and of Lend, Ye Shall Lend [Lending to the Needy]
