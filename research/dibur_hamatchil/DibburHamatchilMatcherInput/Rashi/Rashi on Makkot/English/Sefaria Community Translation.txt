Rashi on Makkot

Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

MISHNA: How are witnesses made zomemim? etc.: In the Gemarah it will be explained what this is saying.

Line 2

Regarding this certain individual: [who is a] kohen.
That he is he son of a divorcee: In our presence his mother got divorced before he was born, and therefore he is a Challal [Illegitimate Kohen] and disqualified [from kohen services].
It is not said: If they were made to be plotters and they are Kohanim. Make this one [the plotters] the son of a divorcee or Halutzah: To fulfill "Like they plotted". He takes on forty lashes: in the Gemara the reason will be explained.

Line 3

That is ruled for [the penalty of] Exile: That he killed someone negligently.

Line 4

GEMARAH: This is how we read it: Why! How are witnesses not made zomimen, it should have asked, and forthermore, as we will teach later on, (Makkos 5a) but if they said to him etc.
How are witnesses not made zomemim we should have asked: In which we can not maintain the requirement of K'asher Zamam [As they plotted].

Line 5

MISHNA: How are witnesses [which come before a rabbinical court to testify] made zomemim [false witnesses]?
Witnesses [proven false] testify that this person is a son of a divorcee or a son of a Levirite marriage. We don't say that they become like a son of a divorcee or a son of a Levirite marriage, rather they are lashed forty times.
Witnesses testify that this person is subject to exile, we don't say that they [the false witnesses] are exiled in his place, rather they are lashed forty times.
GEMARA: Why does the Mishna ask 'How do witnesses become false witnesses?' [since this is not the topic of the Mishnah]
and furthermore, later on we learn
[the definition of a false witness] But they [different witnesses come and] say to them [the false witnesses]. 'How can you testify? On that day and in that place, you were with us [in a different place, and therefore lying].
It was taught previously [in the end of Sanhedrin]
Every false witness is punished the same [punishment that they tried to cause], except for the case of accusing a Cohen's daughter of adultery...
...[now our Mishnah continues] and [then] there are false witnesses who are not given [this kind of] punishment at all, rather they receive forty lashes.
How so?
Witnesses testify that this person is a son of a divorcee or a son of a Levirite marriage. We don't say that they [the false witnesses] become like a son of a divorcee or a son of a Levirite marriage, rather they are lashed forty times.
What is the source?
R' Yehoshua ben Levi said (in the name of R' Raish Lakish)
And you shall do to him as HE plotted, [meaning] to him, and not to his offspring. 
[So] then revoke just his priesthood and not his offspring's,
[but] the laws of false witnesses requires the same punishment, and it is missing here.
Bar Pada said
It stands to reason, a fortiori, since a priest who successfully takes away priesthood from his fellow keeps his priesthood, a priest who is unsuccessful remains a priest.
Ravina argues,
if so, false witnesses can never be punished.

Line 12

This is how we read it: And as for where one is scripturally warned against it's consumption, to not eat from it in tumah, I do not know. The Torah says, "Do not proceed etc.": This is the wording found in the sifre. Ans when it was established here, there was not [time given] to complete it before the Gemara asked, "Why bodily tumah is explicitly written! 'And he may not eat from any holy until he washes etc.'" And we establish in Yevamos that this is referring to maaser from what is written "for if he washed" which would imply that if he did wash he would be tahor, that he immersed, ascended and eats maaser [sheni]. (Our Master, his body was tahor, and his soul exited in a state of tahora. He did not explain any further. From here and on is the words of his disciple Rebbi Yehuda bar Nassan.) This is the wording of the baraisa, to say, "I do not know where one is scriptually warned", therefore the Torah teaches us, "he may not proceed etc.", and the Gemarah was not quiet yet in finishing the matter, rather it proceeded and asked why does it say "I do not know"? Why, bodily tumah is explicitly written in the Torah, "the soul that touched it. etc. may not eat from the holy unless he washed his flesh in water", and we say in Yevamos, that this verse was said regarding maaser sheni, that he immersed, ascended and eats etc.
