Said Abaye: 
Any act that the Torah says should not be done, if one did that act - it is effective
because if you claim it is not effective, why would the transgressor be punished with lashes?
Rava said: 
(The sinful act) is not at all effective. The reason the transgressor is punished with lashes is because s/he transgressed the word of the Torah
