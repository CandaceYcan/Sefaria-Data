WHEN ONE HAS INTERCOURSE WITH A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER, WITH A MARRIED WOMAN, 
WITH HIS SISTER, WITH HIS FATHER'S SISTER, HIS MOTHER'S SISTER, HIS WIFE'S SISTER, HIS BROTHER'S WIFE, THE WIFE OF HIS FATHER'S BROTHER, OR WITH A MENSTRUOUS WOMAN; 
WHEN ONE BLASPHEMES [THE LORD]. SERVES IDOLS, DEDICATES OF HIS CHILDREN TO MOLECH OR HAS A FAMILIAR SPIRIT, OR DESECRATES THE SABBATH;. 
WHEN AN UNCLEAN PERSON EATS OF SACRIFICIAL FOOD, OR WHEN ONE ENTERS THE PRECINCTS OF THE TEMPLE IN AN UNCLEAN STATE; 
WHEN ONE EATS HELEB, BLOOD, NOTHAR OR PIGGUL; 
WHEN ONE SLAUGHTERS OR OFFERS UP [A CONSECRATED ANIMAL] OUTSIDE [THE TEMPLE PRECINCTS]; 
WHEN ONE EATS ANYTHING LEAVENED ON PASSOVER; WHEN ONE EATS OR WORKS ON THE DAY OF ATONEMENT; 
WHEN ONE COMPOUNDS OIL [OF ANOINTING] OR COMPOUNDS INCENSE, OR USES [UNLAWFULLY] OIL OF ANOINTING; 
AND [WHEN ONE TRANSGRESSES THE LAWS OF] THE PASCHAL OFFERING , AND CIRCUMCISION — FROM AMONG POSITIVE COMMANDMENTS. 
FOR THESE [TRANSGRESSIONS] ONE IS LIABLE TO EXTINCTION IF COMMITTED WILFULLY,27 AND IF IN ERROR TO A SIN-OFFERING, AND IF THERE IS A DOUBT WHETHER HE HAD COMMITTED THE TRANSGRESSION TO A SUSPENSIVE GUILT-OFFERING, 
EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF ONE WHO DEFILED THE TEMPLE OR ITS CONSECRATED THINGS, SINCE ONE IS LIABLE IN THIS CASE TO A SLIDING-SCALE SACRIFICE. THUS R. MEIR, 
WHILE THE SAGES SAY: 
ALSO THE BLASPHEMER [IS AN EXCEPTION], FOR IT SAYS: 
YE SHALL HAVE ONE LAW FOR HIM THAT DOETH AUGHT IN ERROR;(Numbers 15:29) THIS IS TO EXCLUDE THE BLASPHEMER WHO PERFORMS NO ACTION.

Rav Ami said, 
"That person that wants to know whether [his life] will extend through the year or not, should bring a candle during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur and suspend it in a room where the wind is not blowing. If its light (its flame) continues, he will know that he will take out the year.
And a person that wants to conduct a business deal and wants to  know if the deal will be a successful one or not, should feed a chicken. If it becomes fat and beautiful, he will know that it will be successful.
That person that wants to go on a journey and wants to know if he will return to his home, should go out and stand in a partially darkened room. If he sees

Daf 6a

a shadow in the shadow of his shadow, he will know that he will return to his home."
And this is not a [correct] matter, lest his spirit become weak [as a result] and his [fortune guided by his] constellation will become bad.
Abbaye said,
"Now that you have said that a sign is a [correct] matter, a man should accustom himself to eating squash, beans, leeks, beets and dates on Rosh Hashanah."
