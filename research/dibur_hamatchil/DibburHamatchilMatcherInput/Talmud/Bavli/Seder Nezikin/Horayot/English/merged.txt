Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

IF THE COURT IS TO DECIDE THAT ANY OF THE COMMANDMENTS MENTIONED IN THE TORAH MAY BE TRANSGRESSED, AND A SINGLE PERSON WENT AND ACTED IN ERROR, ACCORDING TO THEIR RULING, WHETHER THEY ACTED AND HE ACTED WITH THEM, OR THEY ACTED AND HE ACTED AFTER THEM, OR EVEN IF THEY DID NOT ACT AND HE ACTED, HE IS EXEMPT FROM HANGING BY THE COURT.
IF THE COURT RULES ONE OF THEM, WHO KNEW THAT THEY HAD ERRED, OR A DISCIPLE NOT WORTHY OF TEACHING, WENT AND ACTED ACCORDING WITH THEIR RULING, WHETHER THEY ACTED AND HE ACTED WITH THEM, OR THEY ACTED AND HE ACTED AFTER THEM, OR THEY DID NOT ACT AND HE ACTED, HE IS LIABLE. AFTER ALL, IT MUST BE BECAUSE HE DID NOT RELY ON THE COURT.
THIS IS THE RULE
TO RELY UPON HIMSELF IS SUBJECTED, AND HE WHO RELIES ON THE COURT IS EXEMPT
Samuel said:
Never is a court responsible unless it says to them ‘You are permitted’.

Daf 10a





Like what happened with R. Gamaliel and R. Joshua. They were traveling on a ship. R. Gamaliel had some bread and R. Joshua had with him bread and flour. When R. Gamaliel's bread was finished he depended on R. Joshua's flour. He said to him: Did you know, that we would be so delayed that you brought flour ? He said to him: Every 70 years a star appears that confuses the (ships) [sailors], so I said to myself: perhaps this star will appear and confuse us. He said to him: So much is in your control, yet you board a ship.  Instead of marveling at me, marvel about the two disciples you have on land, R. Eleazar Hisma and R. Yohanan b. Gudgada,  who are able to calculate how many drops are in the sea, and yet don't have bread to eat or clothes to put on. He decided to appoint them to leadership positions.  When he got back to land he sent for them, but they didn't come. He sent for them again and they came. He said to them: "Do you imagine that I was offering you rulership? 

Daf 10b

It's servitude that I'm giving you, as it is said (I Kings 12:7), And they spoke to him saying: If you will be a servant to this people today.

Daf 11a



Daf 11b



Daf 12a
















































Rav Ami said, 
"That person that wants to know whether he will take out the year or not, should suspend a candle during the ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in a room where the wind is not blowing. If its light (its flame) continues, he will know that he will take out the year.
And a person that wants to conduct a business deal and wants to know if the deal will be a successful one or not, should feed a chicken. If it becomes fat and beautiful, he will know that it will be successful.
That person that wants to go on a journey and wants to know if he will return home, should stand in a friend's room. If he sees a shadow of a shadow, he will know that he will return home."
And this is not a [correct] matter, lest his spirit become weak [as a result] and his [fortune guided by his] constellation will become bad.
Abbaye said, "Now that you have said 
that a sign is a [correct] matter, truly a man should accustom himself to looking at squash, beans, leeks, beets and dates on Rosh Hashanah."

Daf 13b

Rav Papa says

There are five things to forget your learning
Eating from mouse leftovers, and from cat leftovers, and eating the hearts of animals, and the regular consumption of olives, and the drinking of water used for washing, and washing feet one on back of the other.
