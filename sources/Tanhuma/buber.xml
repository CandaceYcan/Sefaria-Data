<title>Preface</title>
<p>Tanhuma at the end of Parashat Noah makes the following prediction:</p>
<p align="blockquote">When the Holy One mixed up their language, not one of them knew his companion&#x2019;s language. What was the language which they had been speaking? It was the holy language through which the world had been created. In this world nations and peoples take issue with the Holy One, but in the world to come all of them will be like a single shoulder for serving him. Thus it is stated (Zeph. 3:9): <italic>For then I will turn over to the peoples a pure language</italic> [<italic>for all of them to invoke the name of the Lord, to serve him with a single shoulder</italic> (i.e., with one accord)].</p>
<p>Tanhuma thus connects the current babble of tongues with the religious splintering humanity has undergone over the millennia since Babel. In messianic times the latter rift will be healed, and humanity will at last be united in the service of the One God.</p>
<p>John Townsend has devoted his life to encouraging mutual tolerance and enhancing mutual understanding between several trends of the Judaic and Christian traditions. As a distinguished student and teacher of Hebrew and classical languages, of biblical and midrashic literature, it is thus altogether appropriate that Dr. Townsend join (&#x201C;with one shoulder&#x0021;&#x201D;) in the multinational and cross-confessional effort to make the riches of midrashic literature available in modern languages.</p>
<p>Members of the confraternity of those interested in rabbinic literature will welcome this latest addition to the growing corpus of midrashim newly rendered into English. Tanhuma is one of the jewels of early medieval Jewish literature, exceptional not only in the limpid purity of its Hebrew, its lofty sentiments and insightful exegesis of the biblical text, but also in its skillful blending of material from many earlier collections of aggadah. One may with relative ease trace the unfolding and reforming of literary or theological topoi from tannaitic through amoraic and postamoraic sources. This pioneering translation will thus serve many audiences: scholarly and lay, students of literature as well as students of religion.</p>
<p>May we all merit the opportunity to bless the translator at the completion of his work as we have at the start&#x0021;</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<title>1. <italic>Tanhuma</italic>, Buber, and the <italic>Tanhuma-Yelamdenu Cycle</italic></title>
<p><italic>Midrash Tanhuma</italic> designates certain recensions of a homiletic midrash on the Pentateuch. These recensions include the following:<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><italic>Midrash Tanhuma</italic> in the standard printed edition;</li>
<li><italic>Midrash Tanhuma</italic>, Buber Recension;<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup></li>
<li>Exodus Rabbah, Part II;</li>
<li>Numbers Rabbah, Part II;</li>
<li>Deuteronomy Rabbah in the standard printed editions;</li>
<li>Deuteronomy Rabbah, Lieberman Edition;</li>
<li>Various other Pesiqta-type material; and</li>
<li>Over a hundred other fragments.</li>
</ol>
<p>One can see from this listing that <italic>Midrash Tanhuma</italic> (Buber) is essentially a sub-division of these recensions, a subdivision which Solomon Buber edited in 1885.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> Unfortunately there exists little exact knowledge about the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic>. Concerning the relation of this version to the other recensions, one can only guess; and there is not too much evidence about its date or place or origin.</p>
<p>Regarding the dating, it is necessary to be specific about what is being dated. A work like this midrash undoubtedly contains fragments of relatively early material, but dating traditions within a document is not the same thing as dating the document as a whole.<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> One can also attempt to date an &#x201C;original recension&#x201D; which lies behind the Buber recension as it exists today. Such speculation may well be valid, but the earlier recension has yet to be isolated.<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> Besides, even a successful dating of such an earlier recension still leaves open the question of when the Buber recension as we know it was formed. This latter problem is not as difficult as dating the recension in hypothetical earlier forms because we are dealing with a document which can be read and studied. In addition, there is one piece of hard evidence. It is quite clear that the Buber recension as we know it cannot have existed much before the ninth century simply because the midrash quotes a whole chapter from the <italic>She&#x2019;iltot</italic> by R. Ahai of Shabba, who flourished in the middle of the eighth century. Moreover, since the quotation appears in Ahai&#x2019;s original Aramaic and uses his literary form, it is highly unlikely that the Buber Hebrew midrash was a source for the <italic>She&#x2019;iltot.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup></italic> For this reason the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> as we know it cannot have existed earlier than this mid-eighth-century work.</p>
<p>The question of where the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> took its present form is more difficult to answer than the question of dating. There is no scholarly agreement over where the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> was compiled, but southern Italy seems to be a likely candidate for at least three reasons. In the first place, all known manuscripts of this recension are European. Secondly, Italy for centuries had been a place where both Greek and Latin were spoken; and the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> contains a significant number of Latin words as well as many in Greek. Moreover, these Latin words are not limited to technical and trading terms. Of course, such usage falls short of proving that the final reviser of the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> knew Latin and Greek. The usage does, however, indicate that both languages at least figure somewhere in the background of the midrash. In the third place, it is unlikely that this work stems from central or northern Italy, because the Midrash misrepresents the geography of these regions. According to <italic>Tanh</italic>. (Buber), Exod. 2:15, the Ticino River, which actually flows from Switzerland into the Po, flows along with the Tiber on the edge of Rome.</p>
<title>2. Arrangement of the Midrash and Method of Citation</title>
<p>The structure of the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> follows a system of relatively short lections which generally follow the so-called triennial lectionary cycle. Printed editions, however, have arranged the sections according to the traditional one-year cycle of readings. The present translation follows the one-year-cycle numbering of the Buber text but indicates the older arrangement with biblical references at the beginning of each section.<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> Within the sections the translation makes paragraph breaks wherever a double period (:) appears in the text.</p>
<p>In citing the lections (i.e., the parashiyyot) of the one-year cycle, the present translation adopts an untraditional method. The traditional method cites each weekly parashah by its proper Hebrew name, but few readers of this translation would likely be familiar with these names. How many readers would readily know, for example, that the <italic>Miqqets</italic> is the name of the parashah that includes Gen. 41:1&#x2013;44:17? In this translation, therefore, although the traditional Hebrew name appears at the beginning and end of each parashah, the parashiyyot have been consecutively numbered within each book and cited by that number. Thus, for example, since <italic>Miqqets</italic> is the tenth parashah in Genesis, that section is referred to as &#x201C;Gen. 10,&#x201D; and the second section of this parashah would appear as &#x201C;<italic>Tanh</italic>. (Buber), Gen. 10:2.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup></p>
<title>3. The Use of Enclosure Marks</title>
<p>The present translation is a straightforward rendering of the Buber text with little emendation. Any exceptions to this rule are mentioned in the notes. Where Buber has given two readings in his text, both readings are translated. In such cases he puts the reading of his Oxford manuscript in parentheses and his preferred reading in square brackets. Buber also puts biblical references in parentheses. However, since the translation has its own additions (commonly extensions of biblical quotations) and explanations, it is necessary to mark both of these with enclosures. Therefore, the translation uses the following four enclosure marks:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>[Square Brackets]:</td>
<td>Buber&#x2019;s square brackets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&#x007B;Braces&#x007D;:</td>
<td>Buber&#x2019;s parentheses where the parentheses represent manuscript readings which he rejects.</td></tr>
<tr><td>(Parentheses):</td>
<td>Biblical references and parenthetical explanations from the translator.</td></tr>
<tr><td>&#x003C; Angle Brackets &#x003E;:</td>
<td>Additions from the translator.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<title>4. Biblical and Other Quotations</title>
<p>The translation generally avoids quotation marks. Standard usage would have involved the nesting of quotation marks to three or even four levels. Besides, it is not always clear from the text where some quotations end. The translation, therefore, has adapted the style of the older biblical translations and introduces direct discourse with a colon followed by a capital letter. Citations from the Bible and the Mishnah appear in upper-case letters. The few quotation marks that do occur generally denote a citation by the midrash of what a biblical verse might have said (i.e., &#x201C;Such and such&#x201D; is not written here but&#x2026;.) or else English translations of Greek or Latin words mentioned in the notes.</p>
<p>Biblical quotations follow no standard translation. Older translations tend to use archaic English, and modern ones are not literal enough for a midrash which often depends upon the exact wording of the Hebrew text. In the present translation, therefore, biblical quotations have been rendered anew to fit their midrashic contexts although, where the same verse appears more than once, its translations remain as consistent as possible.</p>
<title>5. Greek and Hebrew Transliterations</title>
<p>Transliterations of Greek words generally follow normal practice. There are, however, no diacritical marks for distinguishing between long and short vowels. Thus <italic>epsilon</italic> and <italic>eta</italic> are both rendered by an English <italic>e</italic>. Similarly, <italic>omicron</italic> and <italic>omega</italic> both become <italic>o</italic>.</p>
<p>Hebrew transliteration follows the &#x201C;broad transliteration-transcription&#x201D; proposed by W. Weinberg in the <italic>Hebrew Union College Annual</italic>, 40&#x2013;41 (1969&#x2013;1970), pp. 1&#x2013;32 &#x002B; charts, but again without diacritical marks. Thus there is no distinction between <italic>he</italic> and <italic>het</italic>, between <italic>tet</italic> and <italic>taw</italic>, or between <italic>samekh</italic> and <italic>sin</italic>. In the case of <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>&#x2018;ayin</italic>, the former becomes an apostrophe; and the latter, a backward-slanting apostrophe. The usual reason for citing Hebrew words is to indicate plays on words that cannot be recognized from the translation. Where the play is on the whole word, the whole word is spelled out; where similarity involves the consonantal text only, the word appears without unwritten vowels; and where the word play involves only the Hebrew root, only the root letters appear, preceded by the abbreviation &#x201C;rt.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Proper names of rabbinic authorities are rendered by their biblical equivalents where these equivalents are well known. Less well-known names follow the same transliteration system used elsewhere in the work. For a listing of all such authorities, see the index at the end of each volume.</p>
<title>6. Other Remarks on the Style of Translation</title>
<p>In general the present translation tries to follow a middle ground between slavish literalism and an excessively free rendering. There has also been a conscious attempt to avoid sexist language where it is not specifically found in the original Hebrew. <italic>Bene Israel</italic>, for example, is rendered as &#x201C;children of Israel,&#x201D; not &#x201C;sons of Israel&#x201D;; and &#x201C;humankind&#x201D; is used instead of &#x201C;mankind.&#x201D; The divine name, however, is still rendered as <small>LORD</small>. The practice is too entrenched in tradition, and a substitute rendering might not be recognized. In the case of the rabbinic designation of the Deity, &#x201C;the Holy One, Blessed Be He,&#x201D; the title has been shortened it to &#x201C;the Holy One.&#x201D; Apart from the fact that the full designation refers to the Deity in the masculine, there is another compelling reason for some shorter rendering. The title nearly always appears as an acronym, which is treated like a proper name. The fact that the acronym includes the words &#x201C;Blessed Be He&#x201D; appears largely forgotten. Thus, in <italic>Tanhuma</italic> (Buber), 2:4 &#x0026; 11, the acronym has an extra blessing, which creates the following redundancy: &#x201C;May the name of the Holy One, Blessed Be He, be blessed.&#x201D; In order to render the spirit of this acronym into English one might invent a parallel English acronym. Unfortunately, such a practice would be unusual enough to cause confusion for many readers. The practice adopted here, therefore, is to render the acronym as &#x201C;the Holy One.&#x201D; The result is a title that is short enough to be treated as a proper name and yet immediately recognizable as a designation for the Divine.</p>
<title>7. The Footnotes</title>
<p>The footnotes in this work consistently cite rabbinic parallels from all but the latest sources, although even late sources may be noted where they represent particularly interesting variants. In cases where the same rabbinic parallel extends for more than one section of the <italic>Tanhuma</italic> text, the notes generally cite the parallel only where it first appears. In addition to parallels, the notes also indicate Greek and Latin loan words and provide occasional exegetical comments.</p>
<title>8. Abbreviations of Works Cited</title>
<p>Abbreviations for the names of biblical books consist of the first few letters of their English names. In the case of the Song of Songs, the abbreviation Cant. (for Canticles) is used. Wherever the Hebrew and English references differ, the primary reference is to the Hebrew Bible with the equivalent English-Bible reference in brackets.</p>
<p>Talmudic tractates are cited by the first letters of one-word names or by the initials of two-word names according to the transliteration system followed throughout. Mishnaic references are cited by chapter and Mishnah section, e.g., <italic>Yev</italic>. 3:1; references from the Tosefta are preceded by a capital <italic>T</italic>, e.g., <italic>TYev</italic>. 5:1; <italic>Bavli</italic> citations are according to tractate and folio, e.g., <italic>Yev</italic>. 26a; and citations of the <italic>Yerushalmi</italic> have the name of the tractate preceded by a lower-case <italic>y</italic> and followed by the relevant Mishnah reference plus the column from the one-volume Venice-Cracow-Krotshin edition in parentheses, e.g., <italic>yYev</italic>. 3:1 (4a).</p>

<title>9. Acknowledgements</title>
<p>The earlier chapters of this volume were studied in midrash seminars at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge. In the process several students gave translation suggestions which proved helpful. These students included Bruce Beck, Susan Brown, Christiaan A. Beukman, Laurie Braaten, Edward Kessler, Leslie Kobayashi, Arlene Hass, Joy Mattson, and Deborah McCauley. In addition I wish to thank Doctor Reuven Kimelman of Brandeis University, who has always been ready to answer questions and give suggestions on matters of style and translation. Finally, let me express my special appreciation to Yaakov Elman of Ktav for his many helpful suggestions.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1">1. The extant manuscripts and versions are only now being sorted out by Marc Bregman (Hebrew Union College, Jerusalem). The list of recensions given here was suggested by him in a paper, &#x201C;The Tanhuma-Yelamedenu Midrashim&#x2014;The Present State of Research,&#x201D; which he delivered in a section of the Association for Jewish Studies, Dec. 16, 1985.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2">2. Bregman finds that the manuscripts representing this recension fall into three distinct textual groups. Of these one is represented by <italic>Codex Oxon. Opp. 20</italic> and forms the base for Buber&#x2019;s text. A second, represented by <italic>Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34</italic>, has been translated into German by Hans Bietenhard, <italic>Midrash Tanhuma B</italic> (&#x201C;Judaica et Christiana,&#x201D; 5; Bern: Lang), 1980&#x2013;82.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn4">4. The authorities cited in the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic> come from the fourth century or earlier; and these authorities may well have held some of the views attributed to them. One cannot, however, argue from silence that there is little material from the following centuries because during this period it was not customary to remember authorities by name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">5. Of course, one can raise questions about various manuscript variants that Buber has adopted, but these do not affect the argument presented here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6">6. The quotation, from chap. Mittot, question &#x0023; 155, of R. Ahai&#x2019;s work, appears in Numb. 6:2 (&#x003D; <italic>Huqqat</italic> 2) of the Buber recension. The quotation is also found in Numb. 6:2 of the traditional <italic>Tanhuma</italic> of the standard printed editions, which contains other chapters of R. Ahai&#x2019;s work.</ftnote>

It should also be noted that the beginning of each lection in the annual cycle may not always have agreed with the beginning of a lection in the triennial cycle. For a listing of the triennial lections, see Wacholder, pp. li-xlvii; but note that the sources for this listing do not always agree with the lections assumed in the Buber <italic>Tanhuma</italic>.

<title>Chapter 1 Genesis, Parashah I: <italic>Bereshit</italic></title>
<title>1.1 Genesis 1:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>. It is written (in Ps. 104:3): <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS, WHO SETS THE CLOUDS AS HIS CHARIOT</small>&#x2026;. R. Johanan said:<sup><xref rid="fn9">1</xref></sup> Heaven and earth were created on the first day, and on the second the Holy One<sup><xref rid="fn10">2</xref></sup> created the firmament and the angels. Where is it shown that they were created on the second day? Where it is stated (ibid.): <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn11">3</xref></sup> <small>WHO SETS THE CLOUDS AS HIS CHARIOT, WHO WALKS ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND (<italic>ruah</italic>)</small>. And what is written next (in vs. 4)? <small>WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS SPIRITS (<italic>ruah</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn12">4</xref></sup> R. Hanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. Thus it is written concerning the fifth (in Gen. 1:20): <small>AND LET FOWL FLY (<italic>ye&#x2018;ofef</italic>) ABOVE THE EARTH</small>. Now the word <italic>ye&#x2018;ofef</italic> only refers to the flying of angels, as it is used (in Is. 6:2): <small>AND WITH TWO HE DID FLY (<italic>ye&#x2018;ofef</italic>)</small>. And why were the angels not created on the first day? So that the heretics (<italic>minim</italic>) would not say: Michael was standing in the north with Gabriel in the south, and together they spread out the heavens and the earth. So who did create them? The Holy One by himself, as stated (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED &#x003C; THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree. R. Judah says: The world was being created for six days. Thus it is written concerning the work of each and every day (in Gen. 1:7, 9, 11, 15, 24, 30): <small>AND IT WAS SO</small>. That is R. Judah&#x2019;s opinion, but R. Nehemiah says: The whole world was created on the first day. R. Judah said to him: What is the meaning of what is written concerning the work of each and every day: <small>[AND IT WAS SO]?</small> R. Berekhyah said concerning R. Nehemiah&#x2019;s opinion: (According to Gen. 1:24) <small>GOD SAID: LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH</small>. The expression <small>LET BRING FORTH</small> is only used of something that was prepared from <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>, as stated concerning the first day (in vs. 1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING.</small></p>
<title>1.2 Genesis 1:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>There was once a certain matron<sup><xref rid="fn13">5</xref></sup> who asked R. Jose ben Halafta: In how many days did the Holy One create his world? He said to her: &#x003C; He did it &#x003E; on the first day. She said to him: How do you teach me that? He said to her: Have you never made a &#x007B;drinking&#x007D; banquet?<sup><xref rid="fn14">6</xref></sup> She said to him: Yes. And how many <italic>missus</italic> &#x007B;i.e., kinds of food&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn15">7</xref></sup> did you have? She said to him: Thus and so. He said to her: Did you set all of them before them simultaneously? She said to him: No, I cooked all the foods simultaneously, but only brought them in before them <italic>missus</italic> by <italic>missus</italic>. And all of them<sup><xref rid="fn16">8</xref></sup> are from a single scripture, as stated (in Jer. 10:16): <small>FOR HE IS THE ONE WHO FORMS THE ALL</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.3 Genesis 1:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>R. Judah bar Shallum said: The world was created for the sake of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn17">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;From of old&#x201D; is not written here (in Gen. 1:1), nor is &#x201C;from the start&#x201D; written here, but <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>? This is Israel, which is called <small>BEGINNING.</small> It is so stated (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS HOLY TO THE LORD, THE <italic>BEGINNING</italic> OF HIS HARVEST</small>. &#x007B;From what &#x003C; verse is it shown &#x003E; that they were called <small>BEGINNING</small>? In the verse where it is stated:&#x007D; [Where &#x003C; is the original proposition shown &#x003E;? From what we read on the subject:] <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.4 Genesis 1:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR SHIELD OF YOUR SALVATION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn18">10</xref></sup> &#x003C; The words &#x003E; [speak of Israel. What is written (in vs. 31 &#x003D; vs. 31)? <small>HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM.</small>] (The verse continues:) <small>AND YOUR RIGHT HAND SUSTAINS ME</small>. This is Torah according to what is stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND IS A FIERY LAW</small> (<italic>dat</italic>). (Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36 continues:) <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>. Now is anyone more humble than the Holy One? R. Abba bar Aha said: The student sits before his master. When he is finished, the student says to the master: How I have tired you&#x0021; But Israel was learning from the Holy One. When they are departing, he says to them: How I have tired you&#x0021; It is so stated (in Deut. 1:6): <small>THE LORD OUR GOD SPOKE TO US IN HOREB, SAYING: &#x003C; YOU HAVE SAT LONG ENOUGH AT THIS MOUNTAIN &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;R. said:&#x007D; [Another interpretation:] <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>: R. Simeon ben Zera said: Who is as humble as the Holy One? The student says to his master: Rabbi, teach me one chapter. Then he says to him: Go on ahead to such and such a place. But the Holy One said to Ezekiel (in Ezek. 3:22): <small>GO OUT INTO THE PLAIN [AND I WILL SPEAK WITH YOU]</small>. Then Ezekiel went out and found the Holy One, who had gone there ahead of him. It is so stated (in vs. 23): <small>THEN I AROSE AND WENT OUT TO THE PLAIN; AND, LO, THERE WAS THE GLORY OF THE LORD</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;R. said:&#x007D; [Another interpretation:] <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>: R. Julianus ben Tiberinus said in the name of R. Isaac: See the humility of the Holy One. See what is written (in Exod. 19:19): <small>MOSES SPOKE, AND GOD ANSWERED HIM OUT LOUD</small>. Should it not rather have said, &#x201C;God spoke, and Moses answered him out loud&#x201D;? He did not do that. Instead, <small>MOSES SPOKE, &#x003C; AND GOD ANSWERED HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>R. Abba bar Kahana said: Come and see the humility of the Holy One. What is written (in Ezek. 44:2)? <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: THIS &#x003C;EAST&#x003E; GATE WILL BE CLOSED &#x007B;AND&#x007D; WILL NOT BE OPENED &#x003C; &#x2026; FOR THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL, HAS ENTERED IN BY IT &#x003E;</small>. A King of flesh and blood has the glory of entering by a main gate and not by a lesser one, but the Holy One in his glory entered by a lesser gate.<sup><xref rid="fn19">11</xref></sup> Ergo, &#x007B;it says&#x007D; (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: The students proceed &#x003C; first &#x003E; and after that, the master; but the Holy One does not act so. Rather, for the sake of Abraham, who was sitting in pain (due to his recent circumcision in Gen. 17:26), the Holy One said to his angels: Let us go and visit Abraham. While they were proceeding, &#x003C; first &#x003E; God appeared to him and after that, the angels. It is so stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM BY THE TEREBINTHS OF MAMRE</small>, and after that (in vs. 2): <small>RAISING HIS EYES, HE LOOKED; &#x003C; AND HERE WERE THREE MEN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>R. Simon said: See what is written (in Gen. 18:22): <small>AND THE MEN TURNED FROM THERE AND WENT TO SODOM, BUT ABRAHAM WAS STILL STANDING BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Should it not rather have said, &#x201C;And God was still standing&#x201D;? &#x003C; There is here &#x003E;, however, a scribal emendation.<sup><xref rid="fn20">12</xref></sup> Ergo &#x007B;it says&#x007D; (in Ps. 18:36 &#x003D; II Sam. 22:36): <small>AND YOUR HUMILITY HAS MAGNIFIED ME</small>.</p>
<p>Ben &#x2018;Azzay said: Come and see the humility of the Holy One. &#x003C; The matter is comparable to &#x003E; a king of flesh and blood who mentions his name &#x003C; and &#x003E;, afterwards mentions his creation.<sup><xref rid="fn21">13</xref></sup> But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he mentioned his works, &#x003C; it was &#x003E; afterwards &#x003C; that &#x003E; he mentioned his name. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:1, following the Hebrew word order): <small>IN THE BEGINNING CREATED GOD</small>.</p>
<title>1.5 Genesis 1:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>[(Gen. 1:1:) <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>]:<sup><xref rid="fn22">14</xref></sup> This text is related (to Prov. 8:30): <small>AND I WAS WITH HIM AS AN CONFIDANT</small>. What is the meaning of <small>CONFIDANT &#x2019;MWN</small>? R. Judah bar Il&#x2018;a&#x2019;y said: &#x003C; That he was &#x003E; an expert <small><italic>&#x2019;WMN</italic></small> in the Torah. The Holy One would scrutinize the Torah as he was creating the world. Ergo: <small>AND I WAS WITH HIM AS A CONFIDANT</small>. What is written (in Gen. 1:1)? <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>. There is no <small>BEGINNING</small> but Torah, as stated (in Prov. 8:22): <small>THE LORD ACQUIRED ME</small><sup><xref rid="fn23">15</xref></sup> <small>AS THE BEGINNING OF HIS WAY</small>.

<p>R.

Rather, &#x003C; use the biblical wording &#x003E; (as in Lev. 1:2): <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Numb. 8:12): <small>A SIN OFFERING &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Lev. 23:18; Numb. 8:12; 28:11, 19; 29:8; Jud. 13:16; etc.): <small>A BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>; (or as in Gen. 4:3; Is. 66:20; Ezek. 46:14; Mal. 2:12; II Chron. 33:23): <small>A MEAL OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>. Learn (from the Hebrew word order in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING CREATED</small>, and after that, <small>GOD</small>. When he mentions his creation,<sup><xref rid="fn25">17</xref></sup> &#x003C; it is only &#x003E; afterwards &#x003C; that &#x003E; he mentions his name.</p>
<title>1.7 Genesis 1:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>The <italic>minim</italic> questioned &#x007B;R. Ishmael&#x007D; [R. Simlay].<sup><xref rid="fn26">18</xref></sup> They said to him: How many deities created the world? He said to them: Let us, me and you, inquire of the Torah. They said to him: See, it written (in Josh. 24:19): <small>FOR &#x2026; HOLY GODS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn27">19</xref></sup> He said to them: Read the rest of the verse, &#x003C; where &#x003E; &#x201C;they&#x201D; is not used but <small>HE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn28">20</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Abba the Edomite: Why is <small>HOLY</small> plural (in Josh. 24:19)? Because he is holy in all categories of holiness. R. Aha bar Hanina said: In regard to the Holy One, his way is in holiness; he processes in holiness; he is seen in holiness; his speech is in holiness; the uncovering of his arm is in holiness; [he is beautiful and glorious in holiness]. His way is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 77:14): <small>YOUR WAY, O GOD, IS IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place, the Temple). He processes is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 68:25): <small>THE PROCESSIONS OF MY GOD, MY KING, ARE IN HOLINESS</small>. He is seen in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 63:3): <small>SO I HAVE BEHELD YOU IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place). His speech is in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 60:8): <small>GOD SPOKE IN HIS HOLINESS</small> (Holy Place). The uncovering of his arm is in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 52:10: <small>THE LORD HAS UNCOVERED HIS ARM OF HOLINESS</small>. He is beautiful and glorious in holiness. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD, &#x003C; GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS &#x003E;</small>? Hence &#x003C; the plurals &#x003E; (in Josh. 24:19): <small>FOR HE IS HOLY GODS</small>, in &#x003C; the sense &#x003E; that he is holy in all types of holinesses. &#x003C; The <italic>minim</italic> &#x003E; said to him: But he caused to be written (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD</small> (in the plural) <small>CREATED</small>. He said to them: &#x003C; The plural form of &#x003E; &#x201C;created&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>CREATED</small> &#x003C; in the singular to agree with the singular subject &#x003E;.</p>
<title>1.8 Genesis 1:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>R. Ishmael questioned R. &#x2018;Aqiva,<sup><xref rid="fn29">21</xref></sup> who was interpreting the words <italic>akh</italic> (&#x201C;but&#x201D;) and <italic>raq</italic> (&#x201C;only&#x201D;) as &#x003C; indicating &#x003E; exclusions, with <italic>et</italic> (either the sign of a definite accusative or the preposition &#x201C;with&#x201D;) and <italic>gam</italic> (&#x201C;also&#x201D;) as &#x003C; indicating &#x003E; inclusions. R. Ishmael said to him: &#x201C;In the beginning God created heaven and earth&#x201D; is not written here but <small>ET THE HEAVEN AND <italic>ET</italic> THE EARTH</small>. &#x003C; The use of <italic><small>ET</small></italic> is simply &#x003E; a clarification of Scripture. R. &#x2018;Aqiva said to him: It is written (in Deut. 32:47): <small>FOR IT</small> (the Torah) <small>IS NO EMPTY THING FOR YOU</small>. If &#x201C;heaven and earth&#x201D; had been stated (in Gen. 1:1), we should have said: They are two deities.<sup><xref rid="fn30">22</xref></sup> But <small><italic>ET</italic> THE HEAVEN AND <italic>ET</italic> THE EARTH</small> means those &#x003C; two creations &#x003E; and what was created along with them.<sup><xref rid="fn31">23</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.9 Genesis 1:1ff., Part IX</title>
<p>R. Huna says in the name of R. Eliezer the son of J. Jose the Galilean:<sup><xref rid="fn32">24</xref></sup> He created the new heavens and the new earth ahead of time. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:22): <small>FOR AS <italic>THE</italic> NEW HEAVENS AND <italic>THE</italic> NEW EARTH &#x003C; WHICH I MAKE REMAIN BEFORE ME &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn33">25</xref></sup> David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, I offer you praise for the wonders which you have done in the world. It is so stated (in Ps. 104:1): <small>BLESS THE LORD, O MY SOUL. O LORD, MY GOD, YOU ARE VERY GREAT. YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>. How do the great ones of the world (i.e., the scholars) expound &#x003C; this verse &#x003E;? R. Eleazar and R. Joshua: You were great before you created, but you became very great after you created your world. <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>.</p>
<title>1.10 Genesis 1:1ff., Part X</title>
<p>R. Nathan ben Eleazar questioned R. Samuel.<sup><xref rid="fn34">26</xref></sup> He said to him: How did the Holy One create the world? R. Samuel said to him: When the Holy One desired [to create] the world, he wrapped (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>TP</italic>) himself in light, as stated (in Ps. 104:2): <small>PUTS ON (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>TP</italic>) LIGHT LIKE A GARMENT</small>. He said to him: You have told me in a whisper. Why in a whisper? He said to him: Just as I received &#x003C; this tradition &#x003E; in a whisper, so I have transmitted &#x003C; it &#x003E; to you in a whisper. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said to him: Have we not already heard R. Isaac expounding it publicly?</p>
<p>When did the Holy One become magnified? When he had created heaven and earth. And for whose sake did he create it? For the sake of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn35">27</xref></sup> of whom it is said (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS HOLY FOR THE LORD, [THE BEGINNING OF HIS HARVEST]</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: The written text spells <small>HIS HARVEST <italic>tevu&#x2019;atoh</italic></small>. Why do we read (<italic>qorin</italic>) <italic>tevu&#x2019;ato</italic> (with a final <italic>waw</italic> instead of a final <italic>he</italic>)? Because we only eat from the <italic>tevu&#x2019;atoh</italic> (i.e., the interest of the written text) and not from the principal (<italic>qeren</italic>), since it is preserved for us for the world to come.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: By virtue of the Torah were heaven and earth created. It is so stated (in Is. 51:16): <small>MOREOVER, I HAVE PUT MY WORDS</small> (i.e., the Torah) <small>IN YOUR MOUTH; [AND I HAVE COVERED YOU IN THE SHADOW OF MY HAND, SO THAT I MAY PLANT THE HEAVENS AND LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH]</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: &#x003C; Creation came about &#x003E; for the sake of Zion. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>&#x003C; TO PLANT HEAVEN, LAY THE FOUNDATION OF THE EARTH &#x003E;, AND SAY TO ZION: YOU ARE MY PEOPLE</small>.</p>
<title>1.11 Genesis 1:1ff., Part XI</title>
<p>R. Isaac said: It was only necessary to write the Torah from &#x003C; the words &#x003E; (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn36">28</xref></sup> Why did he write from &#x003C; the words &#x003E; (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small>? To make known his mighty power. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 111:6): <small>HE HAS DECLARED TO HIS PEOPLE THE POWER OF HIS WORKS IN GIVING THEM THE HERITAGE OF THE GENTILES</small>.</p>
<p>Resh Laqish said: A word, as it were, came from the mouth of the Holy One (according to Ps. 33:6): <small>BY THE WORD OF THE LORD WERE THE HEAVENS MADE</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 1:1-27) &#x003C; that &#x003E; by it he <small>CREATED</small>. &#x003C; This account was &#x003E; simply for exacting retribution from the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with toil and wearisome labor, and to give a good recompense to the righteous who preserve the world, which was created by the word of the <small>LORD</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED &#x003C; THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn37">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Aha said: When the Holy One spoke to the heavens that they should be created, they went on expanding. If he had not said: Enough, they would have gone on expanding out until the dead arose.<sup><xref rid="fn38">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS</small>: These are heavens. From what was the &#x003C; earth &#x003E; created? From a lump of snow, as stated (in Job 37:6): <small>FOR TO THE SNOW HE SAYS: BECOME EARTH</small>. So the Holy One blessed them, and they became fruitful and multiplied. David said (in Ps. 134:3): <small>MAY THE LORD WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH BLESS YOU FROM ZION</small>.</p>
<title>1.12 Genesis 2:4ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 2:4:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. Let our master instruct us: When someone sees shooting stars and lightnings, what blessing does he say over them? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ber.</italic> 9:2): <small>OVER SHOOTING STARS, EARTHQUAKES, LIGHTNINGS, AND THUNDERS ONE SAYS: BLESSED BE THE ONE WHOSE POWER FILLS THE WORLD</small>. Note that this is from the Mishnah. Where is it shown from Scripture? Where it is stated (in Ps. 104:32): <small>WHO</small> (i.e., the <small>LORD</small>) <small>LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES</small>. And what is written in connection with it (in vs. 31)? <small>MAY THE GLORY OF THE LORD BE FOREVER</small>. Elijah, of blessed memory, asked Rav Mari:<sup><xref rid="fn39">31</xref></sup> Why do earthquakes come upon the world? He said to him: When the Holy One sees Israel not separating their tithes as they should, earthquakes come upon the world. Elijah, of blessed memory, said to him: Upon your life, that is the &#x003C; apparent &#x003E; reason for the phenomenon, but the root of the phenomenon is this: When the Holy One looks at his world and sees temples of star worship sitting upon their tells in safety, security, and serenity, while his Holy Temple is destroyed, at that time he wants to overthrow the world and shakes &#x003C; it &#x003E;. The Holy One said: All this quaking is for the sanctification of my name, as stated (in Is. 43:7): <small>EVERY ONE THAT IS CALLED BY MY NAME [AND WHOM I HAVE CREATED FOR MY GLORY, I HAVE FORMED HIM, EVEN MADE HIM]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn40">32</xref></sup> Also, through that for which I deserve to be praised, the nations provoke me to anger. One says: The <small>LORD</small> does such and so. Another says to worship the constellations. Another says: I serve the sun and its rays. Therefore, I bring earthquake into the world. Although the heavenly bodies did not sin, because people provoke me to anger through them, they (the heavenly bodies) are also stricken along with them. So it is stated (in Joel 3:4 [2:31]): <small>THE SUN WILL BE CHANGED TO DARKNESS, AND THE MOON, TO BLOOD</small>. And what concern do they have? To make known that no other god created my world along with me. You yourself know that it is so.<sup><xref rid="fn41">33</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: The angels were created on the second day, as stated (in Gen. 1:6): <small>LET THE FIRMAMENT BE IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS</small>. Another text (Ps. 104:3) says: <small>WHO ROOFS HIS UPPER ROOMS IN THE WATERS</small>. And what is written next (in vs. 4)? <small>WHO MAKES HIS ANGELS SPIRITS (<italic>ruah</italic>)</small>. Ergo, it says: The angels were created on the second day. R. Hanina said: The angels were created on the fifth day. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 1:20): <small>AND LET THE FOWL FLY (<italic>ye&#x2018;ofef</italic>) ABOVE THE EARTH</small>. These are angels, as stated (in Is. 6:2): <small>AND WITH TWO HE WOULD FLY (<italic>ye&#x2018;ofef</italic>)</small>. Ergo, it says: They were created on the fifth day. Either according to the words of R. Johanan or according to the words of R. Hanina, you have learned this, that the angels were created only after the Holy One had created his world. Why so? It is simply that the Holy One said: If I create them at the beginning, people will say: They assisted me with my world. The Holy One said: I created my world by myself, as stated (in Is. 66:2): <small>[AND] ALL THESE THINGS MY HAND HAS MADE</small>. Where is it shown about the created beings of heaven and earth? &#x007B;Where it is stated&#x007D; [From what they have read on the matter] (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.13 Genesis 2:4ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. This text is related (to Job 25:2): <small>DOMINION AND AWE ARE WITH HIM</small>. Thus Job had said (in 23:3): <small>OH THAT I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM [THAT I MIGHT COME TO HIS ABODE]</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: If he is in a temple above, I will come to his abode; and if he is in a temple below, I will come to his abode. Now <small>HIS ABODE (rt.: <italic>KWN</italic>)</small> is nothing but a temple, as stated (in Ezra 3:3): <small>AND THEY SHALL SET THE ALTAR UPON ITS BASE (rt.: <italic>KWN</italic>)</small>. Ergo he says: This &#x003C; abode &#x003E; is a temple. (Job 23:4:) <small>LET ME LAY MY CASE (<italic>mishpat</italic>) BEFORE HIM</small>. His friends said to him: Do you not know that he is called the God of justice (<italic>mishpat</italic>)? It is so stated (in Is. 30:18): <small>FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE (<italic>mishpat</italic>)</small>. (Job 23:4, cont.:) <small>AND FILL MY MOUTH WITH PROTESTS</small>. He said to him: If that man&#x2019;s mouth would close, (according to vs. 5) <small>I WOULD KNOW &#x007B;WHAT&#x007D; WORDS HE WOULD ANSWER ME [AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD-SAY TO ME]</small>. Oh that he would answer me point for point as to whether I have sinned or not sinned. (Job 23:8:) <small>SEE, I GO EAST, AND HE IS NOT THERE; AND WEST, BUT I DO NOT PERCEIVE HIM</small>. R. Johanan said: You learn from here that the Divine Presence is in the west. I went south and north without finding him (cf. vs. 9). Why? (Job 23:10:) <small>BECAUSE HE KNOWS THE WAY I TAKE. WHEN HE HAS TRIED ME, I SHALL COME FORTH LIKE GOLD</small>. His friends said to him: Job, how long will you pester with words? Are we not telling you that you cannot go out to meet him and speak insolently with him? They said to him: Can you speak insolently with Michael?</p>
<p>R. Jacob of Kefar Hanin says: (Job 25:2:) <small>[DOMINION AND AWE ARE WITH HIM]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn42">34</xref></sup> <small>DOMINION</small>: This is Michael. <small>AND AWE</small>: This is Gabriel. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE MAKES PEACE IN HIS HIGH PLACES</small>. Even the heavenly beings need peace. The constellations rise up. Taurus says: I am first, and does not see what is in front of him. Gemini says: I am first, and does not see what is in front of him. And so each and every one says: I am first. Ergo, it says: The heavenly beings need peace.</p>

You find that through wisdom the Holy One created heaven and earth.<sup><xref rid="fn44">36</xref></sup> R. Azariah said in the name of Resh Laqish: On the first day he created heaven and earth. Five days were left over. He created above and below on alternate days. On the second day he created the firmament above. On the third day (in Gen. 1:9): <small>LET THE WATERS BE GATHERED</small> below. On the fourth day (in Gen. 1:14): <small>LET THERE BE LIGHTS</small> above. On the fifth day (in Gen. 1:20): <small>LET THE WATERS SWARM</small> below. The sixth day remained for creating. The Holy One said: If I create above, the earth will be angry; but if I create below, the heavens will be angry. What did the Holy One do? He created Adam below with breath from above. Thus it says (in Prov. 3:19): <small>THROUGH WISDOM THE LORD FOUNDED THE EARTH</small>.</p>

When one brings all the letters out from his mouth, he compresses his mouth; but when one brings the letter <italic>he</italic> out from his mouth, he does not compress his mouth. Thus the Holy One created his world without toil. It is so stated (in Is. 40:28): <small>HE NEITHER BECOMES WEARY NOR DOES HE TOIL</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 2:4): <small>WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. R. Tahalifa said: Through Abraham (B&#x2019;BRHM). These are the letters in <small>WHEN THEY WERE CREATED (BHBR&#x2019;M)</small>. &#x003C; They were created &#x003E; through the merit of Abraham. &#x007B;It is so stated (in Gen. 2:4).&#x007D;</p>

<p>(Gen. 2:4, end:) <small>IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD MADE EARTH AND HEAVEN</small>. The Bet Shammay say:<sup><xref rid="fn46">38</xref></sup> The conception &#x003C; of creation came &#x003E; by night; and the doing, by day. The Bet Hillel say: The conception &#x003C;came&#x003E; either by day or by night, and he completed work with the sun on the horizon.<sup><xref rid="fn47">39</xref></sup> R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina:<sup><xref rid="fn48">40</xref></sup> On every day the Holy One created three creations. On the first he created heaven, earth, and the light. On the second he created the firmament, Gehinnom, and the ministering angels. On the third, trees, herbs, and rivers. On the fourth, sun, moon, and stars. On the fifth, fish, Leviathan,<sup><xref rid="fn49">41</xref></sup> and fowl. Now on the sixth, there were six things to create, those for the Sabbath eve and those for the Sabbath. These were the following (according to Gen. 1:24): <small>LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH (1) THE LIVING CREATURE AFTER ITS KIND, (2) CATTLE, (3) CREEPING THINGS, AND (4) BEAST OF THE EARTH</small>, plus Adam and Eve. The work of Adam, Eve, and of the beasts was completed. Then, when he had completed these, he wanted to create the rest; but the Sabbath was holy, as stated (in Gen. 2:1-3): <small>THEN THE HEAVENS &#x003C; AND THE EARTH &#x003E; WERE FINISHED&#x2026;. SO GOD FINISHED &#x003C; ON THE SEVENTH DAY &#x003E; &#x2026; AND GOD BLESSED &#x003C; THE SEVENTH DAY &#x003E; &#x2026; &#x003C; BECAUSE ON IT HE RESTED FROM ALL HIS WORK &#x003E; WHICH GOD HAD CREATED &#x003C; TO MAKE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 2:3):<sup><xref rid="fn50">42</xref></sup> <small>WHICH HE CREATED</small> &#x201C;and made&#x201D; is not written, but <small>TO MAKE</small>, because the Sabbath preceded the completion of the work. R. Bannaya said:<sup><xref rid="fn51">43</xref></sup> These are the demons (<italic>mazziqin</italic>), whose souls he had created. While he was creating their bodies, the Sabbath commenced. So he left them alone and they survive to the present as spirit with no body. They are fruitful and multiply like humans, and they die like humans. So, when one comes upon a female demon (<italic>shedah</italic>), he will have demon (<italic>shedin</italic>) children. Now, from whom did you learn &#x003C; this fact &#x003E;? From the first Adam,<sup><xref rid="fn52">44</xref></sup> who had children from spirits. Should anyone come upon &#x003C; such a spirit &#x003E;, there is nothing against him, because they seem to one like a nocturnal pollution. There are also some who say: <small>WHICH GOD HAD CREATED TO MAKE</small>: This is the Temple which is going to be.</p>
<title>1.18 Genesis 2:4ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 2:4:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS (<italic>toledot</italic>) OF HEAVEN AND EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. R. Berekhyah and R. Helbo said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahman:<sup><xref rid="fn53">45</xref></sup> Every <italic>toledot</italic> which is in the Torah lacks &#x003C; a vowel letter &#x003E; apart from two which are spelled in full. &#x003C; The two are &#x003E; (Ruth 4:18): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS (<italic>toledot</italic>) OF PEREZ</small> &#x003C; and &#x003E; (Gen. 1:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF HEAVEN</small>. Both of them are spelled in full. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Those &#x003C; which lack a vowel letter number &#x003E; six. R. Pinhas said in the name of R. Reuben: They correspond to the six things which &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; took away from the first Adam, and these are the following: (1) His facial luster, (2) his stature, (3) his life (i.e., his immortality), (4) the fruits of the earth, (5) the Garden of Eden, and (6) sun and moon. Where is it shown about his facial luster? Where it is stated (in Job 14:20): <small>YOU CHANGE HIS FACE AND SEND HIM AWAY</small>. Where is it shown about his stature?<sup><xref rid="fn54">46</xref></sup> Where it is stated (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE &#x003C; RE &#x003E; FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>. Where is it shown about his life? Where death was decreed over him (in Gen. 2:17); [for, if he had been worthy], he would have remained alive forever. Where is it shown about the fruits of the earth? Where it is stated (in Gen. 3:17): <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>. Where is it shown about the Garden of Eden? Where it is stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND HE DROVE OUT THE MAN</small>. Where is it shown about sun and moon? Where it is stated (in Is. 13:10): <small>THE SUN SHALL BE DARK AT ITS RISING AND THE MOON SHALL NOT CAUSE ITS LIGHT TO SHINE</small>. In the world to come, however, the Holy One will restore &#x007B;to him&#x007D; [them]. [Where is it shown] about facial luster? Where it is stated (in Is. 61:9): <small>ALL WHO SEE THEM SHALL ACKNOWLEDGE THEM, &#x003C; THAT THEY ARE THE SEED WHICH THE LORD HAS BLESSED &#x003E;</small>. And where is it shown about his stature? Where it is stated (in Lev. 26:13):<sup><xref rid="fn55">47</xref></sup> <small>AND I MADE YOU WALK WITH STATURE</small>. R. Judah says: What is the meaning of <small>STATURE</small>? The time will come when each and every &#x007B;upright&#x007D; one [from Israel] will be a hundred cubits tall. R. Simeon ben Johay says: two hundred cubits, as stated (here): <small>STATURE (<italic>qomemiyyut</italic>):</small> <italic>Qom</italic> &#x003C; <italic>ah</italic>means one stature of &#x003E; a hundred; <italic>miyyut</italic> (read as <italic>me&#x2019;ot</italic>, i.e., &#x201C;hundreds&#x201D;) &#x003C; implies another &#x003E; hundred.<sup><xref rid="fn56">48</xref></sup> Ergo: two hundred. &#x007B;And they would live forever?&#x007D; [And where is it shown about his life?] Where it is stated (in Is. 65:22): <small>AS LONG AS THE DAYS OF A TREE SHALL BE THE DAYS OF MY PEOPLE</small>&#x2026;. And where is it shown about the fruits of the earth?<sup><xref rid="fn57">49</xref></sup> Where it is stated (in Ezek. 47:12): <small>AND BY THE RIVER UPON ITS BANK ON BOTH SIDES [SHALL GROW EVERY TREE FOR FOOD. THEIR LEAF SHALL NOT WITHER, NEITHER SHALL THEIR FRUIT FAIL. THEY SHALL BRING FORTH NEW FRUIT EVERY MONTH]</small>. Where is it shown about the Garden of Eden? Where it is stated (in Hos. 14:8 [7]): <small>THOSE WHO DWELL IN HIS SHADOW SHALL BE TRANSFORMED. THEY SHALL GROW GRAIN AND BLOSSOM LIKE A VINE</small>. Where is it shown about sun and moon? Where it is stated (in Is. 30:26): <small>MOREOVER, THE LIGHT OF THE MOON SHALL BE AS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN, AND THE LIGHT OF THE SUN SHALL BE SEVENFOLD, AS THE LIGHT OF THE SEVEN DAYS</small>. R. Aha said in the name of R. Hanina: The wound from the blow to the world will heal.</p>
<title>1.19 Genesis 2:4ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>One text says (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>, but another says (in Gen. 2:4): <small>ON THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE EARTH AND HEAVEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn58">50</xref></sup> The Bet Shammay say: Heaven was created first (according to Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>. But the Bet Hillel say: Earth was created first, as stated (in Gen. 2:4): <small>ON THE DAY THAT THE LORD GOD MADE EARTH AND HEAVEN</small>. R. Judah b. R. Il&#x2019;ay said: The Scripture supports the Bet Hillel, since it is stated (in Ps. 102:26): <small>BEFOREHAND YOU ESTABLISHED THE EARTH</small>. Moreover, R. Hanina said: You have learned it from your place (in Gen. 1:1), where it is stated: <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED</small>&#x2026;. And what is written next (in vs. 2)? <small>AND THE EARTH WAS VOID</small>&#x2026;. R. Simeon ben Johay said: I am amazed at how the ancestors of the world (i.e., the scholars) were divided on the creation of heaven and earth. So how were they created? Just as a pot<sup><xref rid="fn59">51</xref></sup> and its cover did the Holy One create the heavens and the earth. Thus it is stated (in Is. 48:13): <small>MOREOVER, MY HAND HAS FOUNDED EARTH [AND MY RIGHT HAND HAS SPREAD OUT HEAVEN]</small>. Why did the Holy One put heaven before earth (in Gen. 1:1) and earth before heaven (in Gen. 2:4)? In order to teach you that both of them are considered together. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said: In the creation (of Gen. 1:1) heaven preceded earth, but in the making (of Gen. 2:4) earth preceded heaven.</p>
<title>1.20 Genesis 2:4ff., Part IX</title>
<p>A certain matron<sup><xref rid="fn60">52</xref></sup> queried R. Jose: It is written (in Deut. 11:21): <small>SO THAT YOUR DAYS AND THE DAYS OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY BE MULTIPLIED &#x2026; AS LONG AS THE HEAVENS REMAIN OVER THE EARTH</small>. You are to exist only as long as heaven and earth exist; yet heaven and earth are going to be destroyed, for Isaiah has said so (in Is. 51:6): <small>LIFT UP YOUR EYES TO THE HEAVENS, AND LOOK AT &#x003C; THE EARTH BENEATH; FOR THE HEAVENS SHALL VANISH LIKE SMOKE, AND THE EARTH SHALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; R. Jose &#x003E; said to her: From the very prophet through whom you have reproved me, I shall answer you. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:22): <small>AS THE NEW HEAVENS [AND THE NEW EARTH, WHICH I WILL MAKE, SHALL REMAIN BEFORE ME, SAYS THE LORD, SO SHALL YOUR SEED AND YOUR NAME REMAIN]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn61">53</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.21 Genesis 3:22ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 3:22:) <small>AND THE LORD GOD SAID: BEHOLD, THE HUMAN HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US</small>. Let our master instruct us: What is the rule about saving the scroll case<sup><xref rid="fn62">54</xref></sup> along with the scroll from fire on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab</italic>. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY SAVE THE SCROLL CASE ALONG WITH THE SCROLL AND THE PHYLACTERY CASE ALONG WITH THE PHYLACTERIES</small>. See, our masters have taught (ibid.): <small>ALL SACRED SCRIPTURES MAY BE SAVED FROM FIRE</small>. Why? So that the words of Torah not be burned. Then why does one save the scroll case so that it will not burn? Are the words of Torah written on it? &#x003C; The case &#x003E; deserves to be saved with &#x003C; the scroll &#x003E; because &#x003C; the case &#x003E; is joined to the scroll. Solomon said (in Prov. 13:20): <small>ONE WHO WALKS WITH THE WISE &#x003C; BECOMES WISE: BUT THE COMPANION OF FOOLS SHALL SUFFER HARM &#x003E;</small>. Woe to the wicked and those joined with them, but blessed are the righteous and those joined to them. What is written about the generation of the flood (in Gen. 7:23)? <small>AND HE WIPED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. If people sinned, how had cattle sinned? &#x003C; The principle applies &#x003E;: Woe to the wicked and those joined &#x003C; with them &#x003E;, since they pronounce themselves guilty by being joined to them. R. Judah bar Idi said:<sup><xref rid="fn63">55</xref></sup> The decree against the generation of the flood was not sealed until they had written a nuptial hymn<sup><xref rid="fn64">56</xref></sup> for &#x003C; the union of &#x003E; human and cattle. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>BOTH HUMAN AND CATTLE</small>. Woe to the wicked and those joined with them; but blessed are the righteous and those joined with them, as stated (in Gen. 13:5): <small>AND LOT ALSO, &#x003C;WHO WENT WITH ABRAM, HAD FLOCKS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo: Blessed are the righteous, and blessed are those joined with them. But woe to the wicked and those joined with them. You find that when Korah separated himself, two hundred and fifty heads of the Sanhedrin went with him in the dissension. In addition their wealth went with them. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED &#x003C; ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY &#x003E;</small>. If they had sinned, how had their property sinned? &#x003C; The principle applies &#x003E;: Woe to the wicked and to those joined with them; but blessed are the righteous, and blessed are those joined with them. See what is written about Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (in Dan. 3:21): <small>THEN WERE THESE MEN BOUND IN THEIR MANTLES [THEIR TUNICS, THEIR HATS, AND THEIR OUTER GARMENTS; AND THEY WERE CAST INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE]</small>. And when they came out from the fiery furnace, this is written about them (in vs. 27): <small>THEY SAW THOSE MEN, THAT THE FIRE HAD NO POWER OVER THEIR BODIES, [THAT THE HAIR OF THEIR HEAD WAS NOT SINGED, NOR WERE THEIR MANTLES ALTERED]</small>. Why were their mantles not altered? Because they were joined to them. Ergo: Blessed are the righteous and blessed are those joined to them. The Holy One said Adam heeded his wife, was joined to her, and was driven out, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND HE DROVE OUT THE MAN</small>. If he had heeded and been joined to me, he would have been like me. Just as I remain alive, so he would have remained alive forever. Where is it shown? From what &#x007B;is stated&#x007D; [we have read] on the matter (in Gen. 3:22): <small>AND THE LORD GOD SAID: BEHOLD, THE HUMAN &#x003C; HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>1.22 Genesis 3:22ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 3:22:) <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 24:30): <small>I PASSED BY THE FIELD OF A LAZY ONE, AND BY THE VINEYARD OF ONE LACKING CHARACTER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn65">57</xref></sup> <small>I PASSED BY THE FIELD OF A LAZY ONE</small>. This is Adam who was too lazy to do penance. <small>AND BY THE VINEYARD OF ONE LACKING CHARACTER</small>. This is Eve, who (according to Gen. 3:18) heeded the words of the serpent. (Prov. 24:31:) <small>AND BEHOLD, IT WAS ALL GROWN OVER WITH THISTLES</small>, in that they have filled the whole world with troubles. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BRAMBLES COVERED ITS FACE</small>, in that it is stated (in Gen. 3:18): <small>THORN AND THISTLE &#x003C; IT SHALL BRING FORTH FOR YOU &#x003E;</small>.

<title>1.23 Genesis 3:22ff., Part III</title>
<p>[<small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small>]. This text is related (to Dan. 8:13): <small>THEN I HEARD A HOLY ONE SPEAKING; AND ANOTHER HOLY ONE SAID TO THAT CERTAIN ONE WHO SPOKE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn69">61</xref></sup> Who was <small>THAT CERTAIN ONE</small>? R. Johanan said: This was Michael because he stands to the fore. R. Hanina said: This was Gabriel, who was speaking concerning Israel, since he was saying (ibid., cont.): <small>HOW LONG WILL THE VISION CONCERNING THE REGULAR OFFERING BE</small>? How long will prophecy be gone from Israel? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THAT WHICH IS DESOLATE THROUGH TRANSGRESSION</small>? This is the Temple, which became desolate through our sins. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO GIVE OVER BOTH A SANCTUARY. A SANCTUARY</small> can only be Israel, as stated (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS THE LORD&#x2019;S SANCTUARY</small>. (Dan. 8:13, cont.:) <small>AND THE HOST TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT</small>. How long are they to be trampled under the foot of the nations of the world? (Dan. 8:14:) <small>AND HE SAID TO ME: [UNTIL] EVENING &#x003C; IS &#x003E; MORNING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn70">62</xref></sup> How long will the evil decrees &#x003C; remain in force &#x003E;? Until Israel&#x2019;s evening becomes morning. At that time (according to vs. 14, cont.) <small>THE SANCTUARY SHALL BE VINDICATED</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Dan. 8:13): <small>AND I HEARD A HOLY ONE SPEAKING</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn71">63</xref></sup> He said to him: For whom are all the evil decrees? He said to him: For the first Adam. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HOW LONG WILL &#x003C; WHAT WAS SEEN IN &#x003E; THE VISION LAST CONCERNING THE REGULAR OFFERING AND THE TRANSGRESSION THAT CAUSES DESOLATION</small>? Are you having him <italic>turn back</italic> from the decrees? It is so written concerning him (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL <italic>TURN BACK</italic></small>. (Dan. 8:13, cont.:) <small>TO GIVE OVER BOTH THE SANCTUARY AND THE HOST TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER FOOT</small>. These are the children of the first Adam, over whom death was decreed. (Dan. 8:14:) <small>AND HE SAID TO ME: UNTIL EVENING IS MORNING</small>: Until the morning of the world to come arrives. And, when death and the evil decrees were decreed over him, the Holy One began mourning (in Gen. 3:22): <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small>.</p>
<title>1.24 Genesis 3:22ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 3:22:) <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 3:21): <small>AND THE LORD GOD MADE [TUNICS OF SKIN] FOR ADAM [AND HIS WIFE]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TUNICS OF SKIN</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn72">64</xref></sup> R. Me&#x2019;ir and R. Johanan say: Like the &#x007B;strong&#x007D; [fine] clothes that come from Bethshean, which are in contact with a person&#x2019;s flesh without &#x007B;irritating him&#x007D; [him noticing &#x003C; them &#x003E;]. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: <italic>Leporinae</italic><sup><xref rid="fn73">65</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., kinds of garments&#x007D;. R.

<p>&#x007B;What is the meaning of <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small>?&#x007D;</p>
<title>1.25 Genesis 3:22ff., Part V</title>
<p>[(Gen. 3:24:) <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE HUMAN</small>. R. Judah said:<sup><xref rid="fn77">69</xref></sup> The first hour he conceived the plan. The second he consulted with the ministering angels. In the third he gathered his dust. In the fourth he kneaded him. In the fifth he shaped him. In the sixth he made him into a <italic>golem</italic> (i.e., a lifeless body). In the seventh he breathed the breath of life into him. In the eighth he brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth he gave him the commandment. In the tenth he sinned. In the eleventh he was sentenced. In the twelfth he drove him out, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE HUMAN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO HE DROVE OUT</small>? That he drove him out in afflictions.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>SO HE DROVE OUT (<italic>WYGRSH</italic>)</small>: &#x003C; The Holy One did so &#x003E; since because of him the Temple was destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn78">70</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Lam. 3:16): <small>HE ALSO HAS BROKEN (<italic>WYGRS</italic>) MY TEETH WITH GRAVEL STONES; HE HAS MADE ME WALLOW IN ASHES</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>AND AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE POSTED THE CHERUBIM</small>. They were called cherubim, therefore, because they were many (<italic>rabbim</italic>). Resh Laqish said:<sup><xref rid="fn79">71</xref></sup> Adam did not leave the Garden of Eden until he had cursed and blasphemed.<sup><xref rid="fn80">72</xref></sup> Here (in Gen. 3:24) cherubim are mentioned. It is also stated (in II Kings 19:15, part of the passage) concerning Sennacherib: <small>O LORD &#x007B;OF HOSTS&#x007D; [GOD OF ISRAEL], WHO SITS UPON THE CHERUBIM</small>. Just as the cherubim mentioned there &#x003C; appear in the context of &#x003E; curses and blasphemies (vs. 22; cf. vss. 16, 23); so also here (in Gen. 3:24) &#x003C; the cherubim imply &#x003E; curses and blasphemies.</p>
<p>(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>AND THE FLAME OF THE EVER-TURNING SWORD</small>. This &#x003C; flame &#x003E; is Gehinnom, which is ever turning from hot to cold and from cold to hot over the wicked. R. Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said: Now where &#x003C; do we find that &#x003E; they deliver themselves to the cold?<sup><xref rid="fn81">73</xref></sup> Where it is stated (In Ps. 68:15 [14]): <small>IT SNOWED IN ZALMON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn82">74</xref></sup> And who will be delivered from the judgment of Gehinnom? One who is busy in the Torah. (Gen. 3:24:) <small>AND THE FLAME OF THE EVER-TURNING SWORD: SWORD</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Ps. 149:6 concerning Israel&#x2019;s saints): <small>&#x003C; LET THE HIGH PRAISES OF GOD BE IN THEIR MOUTH &#x003E;, AND A TWO-EDGED SWORD IN THEIR HAND</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 3:24, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THE WAY [TO THE TREE OF LIFE</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: <small>TO KEEP THE WAY]</small> comes before <small>THE TREE OF LIFE</small>. The Holy One said to &#x003C; Adam &#x003E;: I put you in the Garden of Eden so that you would labor in the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn83">75</xref></sup> and eat from the tree of life; but now that you have sinned, what are you doing here? Get out&#x0021; So he drove out the human. The Holy One said to him: You should have uttered songs before me about how I created you and about what I did with you, but you did not speak. Here I was talking to myself, as stated (in Is. 5:1): <small>LET ME SING TO MY BELOVED</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn84">76</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He drove him from this world, as stated (in Job 14:19): <small>ITS TORRENTS WASH AWAY THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn85">77</xref></sup> R. Simon said: Even the first Adam was washed away in water.<sup><xref rid="fn86">78</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Judah the man of Kefar &#x2018;Akko said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay: The radiance of the first Adam&#x2019;s face was unchanged, and &#x003C; its &#x003E; lights were not eclipsed until the Sabbath ended; for when he had judged him, he kept the Sabbath holy. Therefore, he utters (according to Ps. 92:1): <small>A PSALM, A SONG FOR THE SABBATH DAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn87">79</xref></sup> You find that when Cain killed Abel, the Holy One appeared to him and said to him (in Gen. 4:9): <small>WHERE IS YOUR BROTHER ABEL</small>? He sought to deceive the one above. The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 4:10): <small>WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? YOUR BROTHER&#x2019;S BLOOD CRIES OUT UNTO ME</small>. When Cain heard &#x003C; that &#x003E;, he began to make a fraudulent repentance, as stated (in Gen. 4:13): <small>AND CAIN SAID TO THE LORD: MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, since you bear with the heavenly and the earthly ones, can you not bear my sin?</p>
<p>Another interpretation: He said to him: Sovereign of the World, you have been proclaimed (in Micah 7:18): <small>WHO IS A GOD LIKE YOU, FORGIVING SIN AND PASSING OVER TRANSGRESSION</small>? (Gen. 4:13:) <small>MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have repented. By your life, I am revoking one decree from you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 4:16): <small>AND CAIN WENT OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND DWELT IN THE LAND OF NOD</small>. While he was going away, the first Adam met him. He said to him: What happened about your sentence. He said: If I had not confessed, I should already have disappeared from the world. Adam said at that time (in Ps. 92:2 [1]): <small>IT IS GOOD TO CONFESS TO THE LORD</small>. In this world individuals confess to the Holy One, but in the world to come they all confess to him. So it is stated (in Is. 12:1): <small>I WILL CONFESS TO YOU, O LORD; FOR, THOUGH YOU WERE ANGRY WITH ME, YOUR ANGER IS TURNED AWAY, AND YOU COMFORT ME</small>.</p>
<title>1.26 Genesis 5:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>. Let our master instruct us: May one cease being fruitful and multiplying at a time when he has no children? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Yev</italic>. 6:6): <small>ONE IS NOT TO CEASE FROM BEING FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYING UNLESS HE ALREADY HAS CHILDREN. THE BET SHAMMAY SAY: TWO MALES; BUT THE BET HILLEL SAY: A MALE AND A FEMALE, AS STATED</small> (in Gen 5:2): <small>MALE AND FEMALE HE CREATED THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn88">80</xref></sup> What is the reasoning of the Bet Shammay? Through analogy with Cain and Abel.<sup><xref rid="fn89">81</xref></sup> What is the reasoning of the Bet Hillel? Through analogy with Adam and Eve. R. Simon said: Adam separated himself from his wife Eve for a hundred and thirty years after Abel was killed. Adam said: How am I to beget children when they go to destruction? What did he do? R. Simon said: Female spirits would come to him and become inflamed with passion from him; for so the Holy One told David (in I Chron. 22:8): <small>BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN TO YOU, &#x007B;AND&#x007D; HE SHALL BE A MAN OF REST</small>. (II Sam. 7:14:) <small>I WILL BE TO HIM A FATHER, AND HE SHALL BE TO ME A SON</small>. When? When he is busy in the Torah. But when he forsook me and walked in the way of his &#x003C; own &#x003E; heart, (ibid., cont.): <small>WHEN HE TRANSGRESSES, I WILL PUNISH HIM WITH THE ROD OF MEN AND WITH THE PESTILENCES OF THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THE ROD OF MEN</small>? These &#x003C; words &#x003E; refer to Hadad and Rezon ben Eliada. Thus it is stated (in I Kings 11:23) <small>AND [GOD] RAISED UP AN ADVERSARY (<italic>satan</italic>) FOR HIM &#x007B;FOR SOLOMON&#x007D;, [REZON BEN ELIADA]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn90">82</xref></sup> <small>[AND WITH THE PESTILENCES OF THE CHILDREN OF ADAM.]</small><sup><xref rid="fn91">83</xref></sup> <small>PESTILENCES</small> can only be the demons (<italic>mazziqin</italic>). Thus it is stated (in Ps. 91:10): <small>NEITHER SHALL PESTILENCE COME NEAR YOUR TENT</small>. &#x003C; The above is &#x003E; to make known to you that during the whole 130 years in which Adam had withdrawn from Eve, the spirits were coming to him and being inflamed with passion from him so that he was begetting demons (<italic>mazziqin</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn92">84</xref></sup> At that time the Holy One said: I created my world only for fruitfulness and multiplying. So it is stated (in Is. 45:18): <small>HE DID NOT CREATE IT AS A VOID; HE FORMED IT FOR HABITATION</small>. What did the Holy One do? He put a sexual desire for Eve into the heart of Adam. So he had intercourse with her, and she bore Seth. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:3): <small>WHEN ADAM HAD LIVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS, HE BEGOT &#x003C; A SON &#x003E; IN HIS OWN LIKENESS &#x007B;IN&#x007D; [AFTER] HIS IMAGE</small>. When Seth was born, Adam said: I did not ascribe my former sons a lineage. Why? Because they were accursed. But to this one I am ascribing a lineage because he is the head of [the] generations. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Gen. 5:1-3): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM&#x2026;. HE BEGOT &#x003C; A SON &#x003E; &#x2026; AND CALLED HIS NAME SETH</small>.</p>
<title>1.27 Genesis 5:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[<small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS &#x2026; AND ADAM LIVED &#x2026; AND BEGOT &#x003C; A SON &#x003E; IN HIS OWN IMAGE AFTER HIS LIKENESS</small>.] From here they have said: Whoever has sexual intercourse with the spirits does nothing wrong. There is no fornication. Although he brought forth an issue of semen, it is like a nocturnal emission of fluid. And what is that which is written (in Exod. 20:13)? <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small> with the children of Adam and with cattle. Also <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small> with the hand or the foot.<sup><xref rid="fn93">85</xref></sup> In regard to spirits, however, there is no fornication. Moreover, there is a story about a certain saint<sup><xref rid="fn94">86</xref></sup> whom a female demon (<italic>shedah</italic>) came across in the likeness of a woman. When she had enticed him,<sup><xref rid="fn95">87</xref></sup> she had intercourse<sup><xref rid="fn96">88</xref></sup> with him; and it was the Day of Atonement. Now afterwards that saint was exceedingly remorseful until Elijah, of blessed memory, met him. He said to him: On what account are you depressed? He told him the whole story as it had happened to him. He said to him: You are acquitted. She was a demon. Now, if he had been guilty, Elijah, of blessed memory, [would not have] appeared to him, spoken with him, and acquitted him. [Rather] you may infer from this &#x003C; appearance &#x003E; that there was no fornication, and that he was acquitted.</p>
<title>1.28 Genesis 5:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:16): <small>&#x003C; AS &#x003E; MY LIFELESS FORM (<italic>golem</italic>), YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>. While Adam was lying as a lifeless form (<italic>golem</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn97">89</xref></sup> the Holy One showed him every generation with its preachers, every generation with its righteous, every generation with its wicked, up to &#x003C; the age &#x003E; when the dead are raised. He said to him (ibid.): Whatever <small>YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN, IN YOUR BOOK THEY WERE ALL WRITTEN DOWN, &#x003C; EVEN THE DAYS WHICH WERE ORDAINED &#x003E;</small>. And what is the meaning (of the end of the verse): <small>AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small>? R. Eliezer and R. Joshua disagree. [R. Eliezer &#x003C; following the written text &#x003E; says: <small>EVEN THE DAYS WHICH WERE ORDAINED, AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small> &#x003C; that belied what was written &#x003E;. The Holy One said: On this day I am redeeming my children from Egypt, and on this day I am dividing the sea and throwing down their enemies. On this day I am bestowing the Torah. Yet not one day was changed or transferred &#x003C; from what was written &#x003E;. Ergo, it says: <small>AND THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THEM</small>. R. Joshua &#x003C; following the oral text &#x003E; says: <small>AND ONE OF THEM WAS &#x007B;NOT&#x007D; [HIS OWN]</small>. Of the days which the Holy One created, he chose <small>ONE OF THEM</small> as <small>HIS OWN</small>. And which one was it? This was the Day of Atonement, as stated (in Is. 58:6): <small>IS NOT THIS THE FAST THAT I HAVE CHOSEN?</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of the oral text to Ps. 139:16): <small>AND ONE OF THEM WAS [HIS OWN]</small>. This refers to the Sabbath day, as stated (in Exod. 21:11): <small>WHEREFORE THE LORD HAS BLESSED THE SABBATH DAY AND HALLOWED IT</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 139:16): <small>&#x003C; AS &#x003E; MY LIFELESS FORM, YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>. &#x003C; The verse implies &#x003E; that the Holy One showed the first Adam all the generations and put them in his book. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:1): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>.</p>
<title>1.29 Genesis 5:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Job 37:7:) <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON&#x2019;S HAND</small>. What does that mean? That when the Holy One created the human, he had all generations pass before him up until the dead would rise, the righteous and the wicked. He said to him: Look at how you have brought death upon the righteous. When Adam heard that, he began to be depressed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, have I also done this to your world? I have no concern over the wicked, that they should die, but over the righteous, lest they murmur against me. If you please, just do not record concerning me that I brought death upon them. The Holy One said to him: Thus shall I do: When someone is going to depart from this world, the Holy One appears to him. He says to him: Write down the deeds which you have done, since you are dying for the deeds which you have done. So he writes. When he has written, he says to him: Sign; and he signs, as stated (ibid.): <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON&#x2019;S HAND</small>. Then, in the age to come, when the Holy One sits in judgment with his creatures, he will bring all the books of the children of Adam (mentioned in Gen. 5:1) and reveal their deeds to them. Therefore, it is stated (Job 37:7): <small>HE SIGNS WITH EACH PERSON&#x2019;S HAND</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.30 Genesis 5:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 5:1): <small>THIS IS THE BOOK &#x003C; OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 41:2): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND DONE IT? THE ONE WHO NAMED THE GENERATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. If the generations were worthy, the Holy One gave them their names just as he had given names to Adam and Eve. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:2): <small>AND HE GAVE THEM THE NAME ADAM</small>. You also find that when the Holy One sees a righteous one born, he gives him his name as a mark of honor. He named Noah because he was righteous, as stated (in Gen. 5:29): <small>AND HE CALLED HIS NAME NOAH</small>. He named Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 17:5): <small>BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ABRAHAM</small>. So also with Isaac, Jacob, Solomon, and Josiah. Thus it is stated (in I Kings 13:2): <small>BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN UNTO THE HOUSE OF DAVID; JOSIAH SHALL BE HIS NAME</small>. If the generations were worthy, he would give a name to each and every one; and from his name he would make known his works. Our masters have said:<sup><xref rid="fn98">90</xref></sup> When R. Me&#x2019;ir would see a person, he would learn his name, and from his name he would know his works. Once upon a time two students came to him, and one had the name Kidor. R. Me&#x2019;ir said to his students: Beware of this Kidor. They said to him: He is a Torah scholar. He said to them: [Nevertheless], you yourselves beware of him. One day they went to the bathhouse and deposited their clothes with Kidor. He took their clothes and went away. When they came out, they did not find &#x003C; him &#x003E;. They went to their houses and put on other clothes. They came to R. Me&#x2019;ir. R. Me&#x2019;ir said to them: Why did you change your clothes? They said to him: We went to the bathhouse and deposited our clothes with Kidor, but he took them. He said to them: Did I not say to you: Beware of this man? They said to him: O our master, if you please, &#x003C; tell us &#x003E; how you knew. He said to them: From his name, for it is written (in Deut. 32:20): <small>FOR (<italic>Ki</italic>) A GENERATION (<italic>dor</italic>) OF PERVERSITY ARE THEY</small>&#x2026;. So also you find in Egypt (in Numb. 3:21): <small>THE LIBNITE FAMILY</small>. At what time did he give them their names? When Pharaoh arose and worked them with clay and brick (rt.: <italic>LBN</italic>). Ergo: <small>THE LIBNITE (rt.: <italic>LBN</italic>) FAMILY</small>. (Deut. 32:20, cont.:) <small>AND THE SHIMEITE (rt.: <italic>ShM</italic>&#x2018;) FAMILY</small>. When they complained of the servitude, the Holy One heard (rt.: <italic>ShM</italic>&#x2018;) their prayer. (Deut. 32:27:) <small>AND THE HEBRONITE (rt.: <italic>HBR</italic>) FAMILY</small>, to whom the Divine Presence was allied (rt.: <italic>HBR</italic>). &#x003C;These examples &#x003E; are to teach you that if the generations were worthy, the Holy One would give them their names, as stated (in Is. 41:4): <small>THE ONE WHO NAMED THE GENERATIONS</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.31 Genesis 5:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 41:4): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND PRODUCED</small>. The Holy One also told Rebekah what he was going to do, as stated (in Gen. 25:22f.): <small>SO SHE WENT TO INQUIRE OF THE LORD; AND THE LORD SAID TO HER: TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB</small>. Then he said to her: Esau I hate, and Jacob I love,<sup><xref rid="fn99">91</xref></sup> as stated (at the end of vs. 23): <small>AND THE ELDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER</small>. The Holy One made known to her everything &#x003C; about them &#x003E; before they were born. He said to her: You are like a field that is sown and thrives, so that the storehouses are full of grain and the stables<sup><xref rid="fn100">92</xref></sup> &#x003C; full of &#x003E; straw. He said: &#x007B;She shall be the&#x007D; [You shall be blessed like that] field which fills the barns with grain, and the stables<sup><xref rid="fn101">93</xref></sup> with straw. The Holy One said to Rebekah: Let there be prosperity in this belly, since it is going to fill up the Garden of Eden with righteous &#x003C; offspring &#x003E; and Gehinnom with wicked &#x003C; offspring &#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB</small>. It is therefore stated (in Is. 41:4): <small>WHO HAS WROUGHT AND PRODUCED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn102">94</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.32 Genesis 5:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK</small>&#x2026;. What did the Holy One do to Adam? He cast a sleep upon him and showed him Noah and all the unblemished, Abraham and all the proselytes, Isaac and all who sacrifice burnt offerings, Jacob and all tent dwellers, Moses and all the humble, Aaron and all the priests, Joshua and all the community leaders, David and all the kings, [Solomon and all the Judges]. Then, when he had seen them all, he awakened from his sleep. The Holy One said to him: Have you seen [these? By your life], all these righteous [are] coming forth from you. When he had told him this, his spirit was at rest. David said: Sovereign of the World, you have written me into the book of the first Adam, as stated (in Ps. 40:8 [7]): <small>THEN SAID I: LO, I HAVE COME. IN THE SCROLL OF THE BOOK IT IS WRITTEN CONCERNING ME</small>. Therefore I must utter a song to you, since it is stated: <small>THEN SAID I</small>. Now <small>THEN</small> can only be <small>A SONG</small> [according to what is stated (in Exod. 15:1): <small>MOSES SANG THEN</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn103">95</xref></sup> &#x003C; David &#x003E; therefore praises<sup><xref rid="fn104">96</xref></sup> him (in Ps. 40:6 [5]): <small>YOU HAVE DONE MANY THINGS, O LORD MY GOD</small>. When should we utter a song to you? In the world to come, as stated (in Ps. 98:1): <small>A PSALM. O SING TO THE LORD A NEW SONG</small>.</p>
<title>1.33 Genesis 6:5ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:5:) <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT HUMAN EVIL HAD BECOME GREAT ON THE EARTH</small>. Let our master instruct us: How great is the judgment against the wicked in Gehinnom? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>&#x2018;Eduy</italic>. 2:10): <small>THE SENTENCE</small> of the wicked in Gehinnom <small>IS TWELVE MONTHS</small>. These &#x003C; words&#x003E; are from the Mishnah.<sup><xref rid="fn105">97</xref></sup> Where is it shown from Scripture? Where it is written (in Is. 66:23): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHENEVER A MONTH &#x003C; FALLS &#x003E; IN ITS MONTH</small>, i.e., from that month to the same month &#x003C; in the following year &#x003E;. Ergo: twelve months. Thus it is stated (in Esth. 3:7): <small>FROM DAY TO DAY AND FROM MONTH TO MONTH &#x003C; EQUALS &#x003E; [TWELVE MONTHS]</small>. How were they judged? By fire and by snow, since it is stated (in Prov. 31:21): <small>SHE IS NOT AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW</small>. This is Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn106">98</xref></sup> Now they take that &#x003C; wicked one &#x003E; out of the snow and cast him into the midst of the fire. David said (in Ps. 40:3 [2]): <small>AND HE RAISED ME UP FROM THE PIT OF DESOLATION, FROM THE MIRY MUD</small>. And why is it called by the name <small>MIRY MUD (<italic>YWN</italic>)</small>? Because when they take them and cast them into the fire, they cry: <italic>Vay</italic> (<italic>WY</italic>). Then after that they cast them into the snow, and they cry: Vay. Its name is therefore called <small>MUD (<italic>YWN</italic>)</small>, a place where they say: <italic>Vay, vay</italic> (<italic>WY</italic>)&#x0021; And where do they deliver their souls? Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said:<sup><xref rid="fn107">99</xref></sup> In the midst of the snow, as stated (in Ps. 68:15 [14]): <small>IT SNOWS IN ZALMON</small>. And what basis is there for you to compare the sentencing of the wicked to Gehinnom with the sentencing of the generation of the flood?<sup><xref rid="fn108">100</xref></sup> &#x003C; The basis is &#x003E; that, just as the judgment of the former is to fire and to snow, [so the judgment of the latter was to fire and snow. Where is it shown that it was to fire?] Where it is stated (in Job 6:17): <small>THROUGH ITS HEAT THEY ARE OBLITERATED FROM THEIR PLACE</small>. And where is it shown that it was to snow? Where it is stated (in Gen. 7:12): <small>AND THERE WAS RAIN UPON THE EARTH</small>. And why so? Because by the measure with which a person measures one will measure out for him.<sup><xref rid="fn109">101</xref></sup> See what is written (in Gen. 6:2):<sup><xref rid="fn110">102</xref></sup> <small>THE SONS OF GOD SAW THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS</small>: These were the virgins. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THAT THEY WERE FAIR</small>: These were the unmarried. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY TOOK WIVES FOR THEMSELVES</small>: These were the married. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE</small>, even including males and cattle. R. Huna said in the name of R. Idi: The verdict against the generation of the flood was not sealed until they wrote <italic>gamika</italic><sup><xref rid="fn111">103</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., marriage contracts&#x007D; for males and cattle. For that reason the waters came over them in the form of a woman. Thus it is stated (in Job 6:18): <small>THE WAYS OF THEIR COURSE</small><sup><xref rid="fn112">104</xref></sup> <small>TURN ASIDE</small>. Now <small>TURN ASIDE</small> must imply a woman, since it is stated (in Ruth 3:8): <small>&#x003C; NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT &#x003E; THAT THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO TURNED HE ASIDE, AND HERE WAS A WOMAN</small>. And <small>WAYS</small> &#x003C; can &#x003E; only &#x003C; denote &#x003E; &#x007B;a woman&#x007D; [women], since it is stated (in Gen. 18:11): <small>THE WAY OF WOMEN &#x003C; HAD CEASED FOR SARAH &#x003E;</small>. So also <small>THEIR COURSE (<italic>derekh</italic>)</small>, since it is stated (in Gen. 31:35): <small>FOR THE PERIOD (<italic>derekh</italic>) WOMEN IS UPON ME</small>. Hence one may say: In the manner that they sinned retribution was exacted from them. You know yourself that it is so. See what is written (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY ALL THE SPRINGS OF THE GREAT ABYSS BURST FORTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GREAT</small>? &#x003C; That &#x003E; the Holy One said: Just as they have sinned greatly, so I have exacted retribution from them greatly. Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT &#x003C; HUMAN EVIL &#x003E; HAD BECOME GREAT</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.34 Genesis 6:5ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 6:5:) <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT &#x003C; HUMAN EVIL &#x003E; HAD BECOME GREAT</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Eccl. 2:21):<sup><xref rid="fn113">105</xref></sup> <small>FOR THERE IS A PERSON WHOSE TOIL &#x003C; IS WITH WISDOM</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. It is speaking about the Holy One. And where is it shown that he is called <small>A PERSON</small>? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 1:26): <small>[AND UPON THE LIKENESS OF THE THRONE WAS] A LIKENESS WITH THE APPEARANCE OF A PERSON UPON IT FROM ABOVE</small>. (Eccl. 2:21:) <small>WHOSE TOIL IS WITH WISDOM</small>, as stated (in Prov. 3:19): <small>THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED THE EARTH WITH WISDOM</small>. (Eccl. 2:21, cont.:) <small>AND WITH KNOWLEDGE</small>: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Prov. 3:20): <small>WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE DID THE DEPTHS BREAK FORTH</small>. (Eccl. 2:21, cont.:) <small>AND WITH ABILITY</small>, because the works became ready by themselves. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YET TO ONE WHO HAS NOT TOILED AT IT</small>: These were the mortals. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SHALL HE GIVE IT AS HIS PORTION. THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. (Ibid., vs. 23:) <small>FOR ALL HIS DAYS ARE PAINS</small>, because they were pains for the Holy One with their evil deeds. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HIS OCCUPATION VEXATION</small>, because they vexed the Holy One. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>EVEN AT NIGHT HIS HEART HAS NO REST</small>, because they did [evil deeds] at night. And where is it shown that &#x003C; they did so &#x003E; even during &#x007B;the night&#x007D; the day? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:5) <small>&#x003C; EVERY DRIVE IN THE THOUGHTS OF HIS HEART WAS &#x003E; ONLY EVIL ALL DAY</small>.</p>
<title>1.35 Genesis 6:5ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 15:3): <small>IN EVERY PLACE THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE OBSERVING THE EVIL AND THE GOOD</small>. It is also written (in II Chron. 16:9): <small>&#x007B;EVERY PLACE THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE RANGING ABOUT.&#x007D; [FOR THE EYES OF THE LORD RANGE OVER THE WHOLE EARTH]</small>. They watch the deeds of the righteous and the deeds of the wicked. <small>THE GOOD</small>: These are Noah and his children. <small>AND THE EVIL</small>: These are the generation of the flood.</p>
<title>1.36 Genesis 6:5ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:6): <small>FOR TO EVERY MATTER THERE BELONGS A TIME AND A JUDGMENT</small>. &#x003C; Why &#x003E;? Because the wicked provoke the Holy One when [they say]: The Holy One has sworn never to bring &#x003C; another &#x003E; flood; so we may do whatever we wish. And where is it shown that the Holy One has sworn? Where Isaiah says so (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS AS THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME; [FOR I HAVE SWORN THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH SHALL NO MORE PASS OVER THE EARTH]</small>. The Holy One sees how the wicked are provoking him. He regrets, as it were, what he had sworn and says: What shall I do now that I have sworn? Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 59:15): <small>AND THE TRUTH IS LACKING &#x2026; [BUT THE LORD SAW IT, AND IT DISPLEASED HIM THAT THERE WAS NO JUDGMENT]</small>. Why did the Holy One say: <small>THE LORD SAW IT AND IT DISPLEASED HIM</small>? Why is it, as it were, <small>THAT THERE WAS NO JUDGMENT</small>? The Holy One said: The wicked ones in the world speak this way because I have sworn never to bring &#x003C; another &#x003E; flood. By your lives, I have other judgments to exact from you. So what does he do to the wicked? He drowns them in water, either in a river or in the midst of a cistern. For that reason it states (in Eccl. 8:6): <small>FOR TO EVERY MATTER THERE BELONGS A TIME AND A JUDGMENT</small>. For that reason it is also stated (in Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW THAT HUMAN EVIL HAD BECOME GREAT ON THE EARTH</small>.</p>
<title>1.37 Genesis 6:5ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: This text is related (to Prov. 28:5): <small>EVIL PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>: These are the generation of the flood, who were sinning without considering that retribution was coming upon them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THOSE WHO SEEK THE LORD UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING</small>. These are Noah and his children, who heard from the Holy One that he would bring the flood and stood in awe of the Holy One. Come and see why the Holy One told Noah and his children to make an ark.<sup><xref rid="fn114">106</xref></sup> &#x003C; He did so &#x003E; for them to see him while he was working on it and repent. Otherwise, could not the Holy One have rescued Noah through the heavens or through other means instead of telling him (in Gen. 6:14): <small>MAKE YOURSELF AN ARK OF GOPHER WOOD</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn115">107</xref></sup> (Gen. 6:16:) <small>AND YOU ARE TO MAKE A WINDOW</small> (for enlightenment)<sup><xref rid="fn116">108</xref></sup> <small>FOR THE ARK</small>. And why so? The Holy One said: For this reason: When I tell him to make an ark and he is busy at it, they will gather about him and say to him: Noah, what are you making? Then he will say to them: An ark, for the Holy One has told me that he is bringing a flood to the world because they are provoking him; and thereby they will repent. So the Holy One calculated, but they paid no attention to him. Ergo it says (in Prov. 28:5): <small>EVIL PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>.</p>
<title>1.38 Genesis 6:5ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: This text is related (to Eccl. 10:5): <small>THERE IS AN EVIL WHICH I HAVE SEEN UNDER THE SUN</small>. The Holy One said: See what these evil ones have done&#x0021; I made two natures in people, a good drive and an evil drive. Thus it is stated (in Eccl. 9:14): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn117">109</xref></sup> <small>A SMALL CITY</small>: This is the body. <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>: These are &#x003C; its &#x003E; members. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT</small>: This &#x003C; king &#x003E; is the evil drive. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>: These are sins. (Ibid., vs. 15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A [POOR WISE] PERSON &#x007B;WHO WAS POOR, WILLING, AND WISE&#x007D;</small>. This one is the good drive. (Ibid., cont:) <small>AND HE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>, in that it brings a person to life. (Ibid., cont:) <small>BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT &#x003C; THAT POOR PERSON &#x003E;</small>: This is the generation of the flood who did not accept the good drive for themselves.</p>
<title>1.39 Genesis 6:5ff., Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:5): <small>AND THE LORD SAW</small>: What is written above on the subject (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; &#x003C; AND NOAH BEGAT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn118">110</xref></sup> Come and see all who preceded Noah. They were begetting at seventy, eighty, and a hundred years of age; but Noah begat at five hundred years. And why so? Noah had reflected on the children of Adam who would rise and provoke the Holy One. So he said: Why should I join in intercourse for fruitfulness and multiplying? Therefore, he did not beget until he was five hundred years old; but after that he said: Is this person to die without children? Now the Holy One has commanded Adam about fruitfulness and multiplying, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM, [AND GOD SAID TO THEM: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY]</small>; yet I am dying without children. What did Noah do? He joined in intercourse for fruitfulness and multiplying after five hundred years. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; [AND NOAH BEGAT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH]</small>.</p>
<title>1.40 Genesis 6:5ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:3:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED IN HUMANS FOREVER</small>. Resh Laqish said: The Holy One said: I am not creating another soul for humans. Thus it is stated: <small>MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED IN HUMANS FOREVER</small>. R. Johanan said: What is the meaning of <small>SHALL NOT BE SHEATHED</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn119">111</xref></sup> When their souls come up to me, I do not restore them to their &#x003C; sheaths &#x003E;. Compare what is stated (in I Chron. 21:27): <small>THEN THE LORD COMMANDED THE ANGEL, AND HE PUT HIS SWORD INTO ITS SHEATH</small>. The Holy One said to them: You are doing evil to yourselves in that you are falling (<italic>nophelim</italic>) from the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 6:4): <small>THE NEPHILIM WERE IN THE EARTH</small>&#x2026;. Why are they named <small>NEPHILIM (rt.: <italic>NPL</italic>)</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn120">112</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because they cause the world to fall (rt.: <italic>NPL</italic>). (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ALSO AFTER THAT &#x2026; &#x003C; THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS &#x003E; BORE &#x003C; CHILDREN &#x003E; TO THEM</small>. R. Berekhyah said: &#x201C;Bore of them&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>BORE TO THEM</small>. &#x003C; These words &#x003E; teach that when a woman saw one of them, she immediately would become hot with passion towards him and bear &#x003C; children &#x003E;. Similarly Ezekiel said (in Ezek. 16:32): <small>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN &#x003C; RECEIVES STRANGERS INSTEAD OF HER HUSBAND &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 6:4, cont.:) <small>THESE WERE THE MIGHTY MEN THAT WERE OF OLD, THE MEN WITH A NAME</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; men whose names have been specified above (in Gen. 4:18): Mehujael, since the Holy One (i.e., <italic>El</italic>) blotted (<italic>mihah</italic>) their names from the world; Methushael (ibid.), since God (<italic>El</italic>) drove him out (<italic>nethasho</italic>). <small>THE MEN WITH A NAME</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn121">113</xref></sup> because they were obstinate and rebellious against the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Job 21:14): <small>YET THEY SAY TO GOD: DEPART FROM US</small>&#x2026;. R. Isaac said: Why were they rebellious? Because they would sow one year and it would produce a harvest for forty years. R. Samuel bar Ammi said: Why were they rebellious? Because they were seeing children and children&#x2019;s children; yet they &#x003C; themselves &#x003E; were not dying. The Holy One said: From now on (according to Gen. 8:22) <small>WHILE THERE ARE DAYS ON EARTH, &#x003C; THERE SHALL BE NO CESSATION OF &#x003E; SOWING AND HARVEST</small>; i.e., they were begetting and burying. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>COLD AND HEAT</small>; i.e., &#x003C; while &#x003E; afflictions had not come upon them, from now on they would be afflicted by fire and snow. There is a story about a certain student of R. Aqiva<sup><xref rid="fn122">114</xref></sup> who was told in a dream: You are dying in &#x003C; the month of &#x003E; Adar, and you shall not see Nisan. That which you have sown you shall not reap. He came to R. Aqiva. He said to him: You will die in glory (<italic>addirut</italic>), you shall not come to the hands of temptation (<italic>nissayon</italic>), and that which you have begotten you shall not bury. The Holy One said: In this world, because the evil drive exists, afflictions &#x003C; also &#x003E; exist among the children of Adam; but in the world to come I am rooting them out from you. It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH</small>. I am also reviving your &#x007B;ancestors&#x007D; [wings]; for thus has Isaiah stated (in Is. 40:31): <small>BUT THEY THAT WAIT FOR THE LORD SHALL RENEW THEIR STRENGTH; [THEY SHALL MOUNT UP WITH WINGS AS EAGLES]</small>.</p>

<title>2.1 Genesis 6:9ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>. [Let our master instruct us: For how many transgressions do women die at the time of their childbirth? Thus] have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab.</italic> 2:6):<sup><xref rid="fn123">1</xref></sup> <small>WOMEN DIE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CHILDBIRTH FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS: [BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CAREFUL IN REGARD TO MENSTRUATION, IN REGARD TO THE <italic>HALLAH</italic></small>,<sup><xref rid="fn124">2</xref></sup> <small>AND IN REGARD TO THE LIGHTING OF THE &#x003C; SABBATH &#x003E; LAMP</small>.

And where is it shown about the <italic>hallah</italic>? Where it is stated (in Numb. 15:20): <small>YOU SHALL SET ASIDE THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH AS A <italic>HALLAH</italic> OFFERING</small>. And where is it shown about the Sabbath lamp? Where it is stated (in Is. 58:13): <small>AND YOU CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>. And why are the women charged with regard to these commandments?<sup><xref rid="fn125">3</xref></sup> Our sages have said: In the creation of the world Adam was first. Then came Eve, and she shed his blood in that he had heeded her. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND TO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. The Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of menstrual blood [so that she may have atonement] for that blood which she shed. And why the commandment of the <italic>hallah</italic>? Because Adam was the <italic>hallah</italic> of the world when she came and defiled him,<sup><xref rid="fn126">4</xref></sup> the Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of <italic>hallah</italic> so that she may have atonement for the <italic>hallah</italic> of the world, which she defiled. And where is it shown that Adam is the <italic>hallah</italic> of the world? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Hal</italic>. 3:1): <small>ONCE THE WOMAN PUTS WATER</small> into the dough, <small>SHE IS TO REMOVE HER <italic>HALLAH</italic></small>. Thus did the Holy One do. R. Jose ben Qetsarta said: Once the Holy One put water on the ground, he immediately removed Adam as his <italic>hallah</italic> from the ground. Thus it says (in Gen. 2:6): <small>BUT A MIST (<italic>&#x2019;D</italic>) WENT UP FROM THE EARTH. THEN</small> immediately (in vs. 7) <small>THE LORD GOD FORMED &#x003C; THE HUMAN (<italic>&#x2019;DM</italic>) OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And the commandment of the lamp exists because Adam was the lamp of the Holy One, as stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>THE LAMP OF &#x007B;GOD&#x007D; [THE LORD] IS THE BREATH OF ADAM</small>. But Eve came and extinguished it. The Holy One said: Let her be given the commandment of the lamp in order that she may have atonement for the lamp which she extinguished. Thus women have been charged with the commandments of the Sabbath lamp. The Holy One said: If you are careful with the Sabbath lamp, I also will be shining for you, as stated (in Is. 60:19): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</small>.</p>
<p>(Is. 41:2:) <small>WHO HAS AROUSED RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE EAST, IS CALLING HIM TO HIS FEET</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn127">5</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Abraham enlightened my world with his righteousness. Why? Because his whole generation was wicked; and from all of it I found only one, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE</small>. Were there two? Only one with his righteousness. And so the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:11): <small>ABRAHAM&#x0021; ABRAHAM</small>&#x0021; Why two times? Because Abraham was righteous from his beginning to his end. Similarly &#x003C; we read &#x003E; (in Gen. 46:2): <small>JACOB&#x0021; JACOB</small>&#x0021; similarly (in Exod. 3:4): <small>MOSES&#x0021; MOSES</small>&#x0021; and similarly (in I Sam. 3:10): <small>SAMUEL&#x0021; SAMUEL</small>&#x0021; They were righteous from their beginning to their end. &#x003C; Where is it shown &#x003E;? From what we read on the matter (in Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH: NOAH &#x003C; WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn128">6</xref></sup></p>
<title>2.2 Genesis 6:9ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>: Thus did R. Tanhuma bar Abba open &#x003C; his teaching &#x003E; in the academy: It is written (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn129">7</xref></sup> R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said:<sup><xref rid="fn130">8</xref></sup> When a righteous one is passing from the world without offspring, he is depressed and weeping. The Holy One says to him: For what reason are you depressed and weeping? For the reason that you have not raised up the fruit of offspring? In this world I have fruit more beautiful than offspring. Then he says to him: Sovereign of the World, what is that fruit? The Holy One says to him: This is &#x003C; the &#x003E; Torah, in which you were busy, for thus it is written: <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. Now there is no tree of life but Torah, as stated (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM &#x003E; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. Who is this &#x003C; righteous one &#x003E; ? This is Noah. Our masters have said: Noah did not die until he had seen all the world in its entirety with its population,<sup><xref rid="fn131">9</xref></sup> not until he had seen the early days<sup><xref rid="fn132">10</xref></sup> of Sepphoris, not until he had seen the seventy peoples who would go out from his loins; and of all these only he had his righteousness mentioned, as stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH: [NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT]</small>. Shem, Ham, and Japheth &#x003C; appear &#x003E; (in the next verse), &#x003C; but &#x003E; only his (Noah&#x2019;s) righteousness is recorded here. Thus it is stated: <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. You yourself know that the above verse (Prov. 11:30) speaks about Noah, since there is written at the end of it: <small>AND A WISE ONE WINS SOULS</small>. Now this was Noah, since he had won souls. Thus he nurtured and fed them. And what did he feed them? R. Aqiva says: He fed fig cake to all of them, human, cattle, beast, and fowl, as it is stated (in Gen. 6:21): <small>AND IT SHALL BE FOOD FOR YOU AND FOR THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn133">11</xref></sup> Now what is &#x003C; the one &#x003E; thing of which the children of Adam eat as well as the cattle, the beast, and the fowl? Thus he (Aqiva) says: This is fig cake. But our masters say: No&#x0021; Rather each and every species ate what it had been used to: the camel, straw; the donkey, barley; the elephant, vine wood; the ostrich, glass. Ergo it says (in Prov. 11:30): <small>AND A WISE ONE WINS SOULS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>AND &#x003C; A WISE ONE &#x003E; WINS SOULS</small>: Some cattle would eat at the first hour in the day, some at the second &#x003C; hour &#x003E; of the day, some at the third &#x003C; hour &#x003E; of the day, and some at cockcrow.<sup><xref rid="fn134">12</xref></sup> Our masters have said:<sup><xref rid="fn135">13</xref></sup> For the twelve months that Noah spent in the ark, he did not taste a bit of sleep either by day or by night because he was busy sustaining the souls who were with him. Thus it says (in Prov. 11:30): <small>AND &#x003C; A WISE ONE &#x003E; WINS</small> (the care of) <small>SOULS</small>. This one is Noah.</p>
<title>2.3 Genesis 6:9ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Prov. 11:31:) <small>BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH. BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE</small>: This is Noah, since it is stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. Because he was diligent [in making] the ark, he was immediately recompensed, as stated (in Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>. R. Huna said: When he came out of the ark, he gave a heartfelt groan,<sup><xref rid="fn136">14</xref></sup> since it is stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT</small>. &#x201C;And Noah was left&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>AND NOAH ONLY WAS LEFT</small>, &#x003C; since <small>ONLY</small> is &#x003E; a term of reduction.<sup><xref rid="fn137">15</xref></sup> R. Johanan said in the name of R. Eliezer b. R. Jose the Galilean:<sup><xref rid="fn138">16</xref></sup> Noah did not leave the ark until the lion had injured him. The Holy Spirit has stated: Are the righteous recompensed and the wicked not recompensed? (Prov. 11:31:) <small>BEHOLD, A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>. The Holy One said: The righteous one angers him for an hour and immediately becomes reconciled; but in the case of the generation of the flood, not one of them survived. The Holy One said: What caused Noah to escape? The righteousness which he had. (Gen. 6:9:) <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>.</p>
<title>2.4 Genesis 6:9ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH</small>: What is written on the matter above (in vs. 6)? <small>AND THE LORD REPENTED (<italic>wayyinnahem</italic>) FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN &#x003C; ON THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree.<sup><xref rid="fn139">17</xref></sup> R. Judah says: The Holy One repented, as it were, over having made the human. The Holy One said: If I had created him in the heavens, he would not have sinned, even as the angels do not sin. For that reason <small>THE LORD REPENTED</small>. For what reason? <small>FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN ON THE EARTH</small>; for, if he had been in the heavens, he would not have sinned. But R. Nehemiah said: What is the meaning of <italic>wayyinnahem</italic> (rt.: <italic>nhm</italic>)? It is a word meaning &#x201C;comforted&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>nhm</italic>). Why so? The Holy One said: I am comforted that I made the human on earth, because if I had made him in the heavens and had had him dwell with the angels, he would have incited them to rebellion, even as he rebelled with the earthly beings. I was, therefore, comforted because I had created him on the earth, as stated: <small>AND THE LORD WAS COMFORTED (<italic>wayyinnahem</italic>) &#x003C; FOR HAVING MADE THE HUMAN ON THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>. R. Aha b. R. Hanina said: When the Holy One saw that his world was ruined, he, as it were, lamented and grieved over it. Similarly you say (in II Sam. 19:3): <small>THE KING IS GRIEVED OVER HIS SON</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE</small> (the <small>LORD</small>) <small>WAS GRIEVED IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Abbahu said: He only lamented over the human heart. Like one who had made something inferior, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; knew that he had not made something right, and said: What have I made? So, may the name of the Holy One be blessed, I am the one who put the evil leaven in the dough (according to Gen. 8:21): <small>FOR THE INSTINCT OF ONE&#x2019;S HEART IS EVIL FROM HIS YOUTH</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE WAS GRIEVED IN HIS HEART</small>, [in the heart] of Adam.</p>
<p>(Gen. 6:7:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY &#x003C; WHICH I CREATED &#x003E;</small>. &#x201C;I will cut off,&#x201D; &#x201C;I will annihilate,&#x201D; &#x201C;I will kill,&#x201D; &#x003C;or&#x003E; &#x201C;I will destroy&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>I WILL BLOT OUT (rt.: <italic>MHH</italic>)</small>. R. Berekhyah said: The heavenly creatures are water within water, and the lower creatures are dust and ashes. Now how does water behave? It descends upon the dust and blots &#x003C; it &#x003E; out. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as the &#x003C; creatures of &#x003E; dust have rebelled against me, behold, I am bringing down water upon them and blotting them out, as stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY &#x003C; WHICH I CREATED &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn140">18</xref></sup> Why is he given the name <small>RIGHTEOUS</small>? Inasmuch as he fed the creatures of the Holy One, he became like his Creator. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 11:7): <small>FOR THE LORD IS RIGHTEOUS; HE LOVES RIGHTEOUS DEEDS</small>. So also Joseph. Inasmuch as he fed the creatures for seven years, he was called righteous, as stated (in Amos 2:6): <small>BECAUSE THEY SELL A RIGHTEOUS &#x003C; ONE &#x003E;</small> (i.e., Joseph) <small>FOR SILVER</small>. &#x007B;Thus, because he fed the creatures for seven years, he was therefore called righteous.&#x007D;</p>
<title>2.5 Genesis 6:9ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; [NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN]</small>. Why the twofold <small>NOAH NOAH</small>? Because his children were righteous like him. R. Aha bar Ze&#x2018;era said: Would you say the children of Noah were righteous, seeing that the generation of the flood was born in wickedness&#x0021; Even as one would go unto a wife who was not his own, so would the cattle go to another species which was not their own. And where is it shown that the cattle were commanded not to go unto a species which was not their own? Where it is stated (in Gen. 1:25): <small>AND GOD MADE THE BEAST OF THE EARTH AFTER ITS SPECIES, &#x003C; THE CATTLE AFTER THEIR SPECIES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One <small>SAID</small>: You are permitted to be joined with your own species, but with another species it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn141">19</xref></sup> The cattle, beasts, and fowl who entered the ark, however, were righteous in that they had been joined, not with another species, but only with their own. R. Pinhas bar Hiyya the Priest said: For thus it is written (in Gen. 8:19): <small>THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES</small>. Did the cattle actually have families as it states: <small>ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES</small>&#x0021; &#x003C; These words mean &#x003E; simply that only those which were joined with their own species were worthy of entering the ark.</p>
<title>2.6 Genesis 6:9ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 6:9:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS [OF NOAH; NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT IN HIS GENERATIONS]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS GENERATIONS</small>? Some interpret &#x003C; the phrase &#x003E; to his praise, and some interpret &#x003C; it &#x003E; to his shame, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; <small>IN HIS GENERATIONS</small> but not in other generations.<sup><xref rid="fn142">20</xref></sup> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? If one should put a silver <italic>sela&#x2018;</italic> among [a hundred] <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic> of copper, the one of silver would seem beautiful. Thus did Noah seem righteous in the generation of the flood. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; how do some interpret it to his praise? &#x003C; The situation is comparable &#x003E; to a young woman who dwelt in the harlot district and remained pure (<italic>kasher</italic>). If she had been in a quarter where decent young women (<italic>kesehrot</italic>) &#x003C; dwelled &#x003E;, how much the more &#x003C; would she have remained pure &#x003E;. &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is like a jar of balsam<sup><xref rid="fn143">21</xref></sup> which was put in a tomb where its aroma was good. If it had been in a house, how much better &#x003C; would its aroma have been &#x003E; &#x0021;</p>
<p>(Gen. 6:9:) <small>&#x003C; NOAH &#x003E; WAS &#x2026; PERFECT</small>, in that he was born circumcised. Ten children of Adam were born circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn144">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF NOAH; NOAH</small>: Why two times? The Holy One said: &#x003C; It was &#x003E; in order to persuade<sup><xref rid="fn145">23</xref></sup> all those who enter the world, lest they think of saying: He was only righteous in his generation. The Holy One said: For me he is the equal of Abraham. R. Judah bar Shallum [the Levite] said: &#x003C; His name &#x003E; is stated two times (in Gen. 22:11): <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM</small>. So also with Jacob (in Gen. 46:2); so also with Moses (in Exod. 3:4); so also with Samuel (in I Sam. 3:10); so also with Noah (here in Gen. 6:9). &#x003C; The double name is used &#x003E; in order to give equality to the righteous ones.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH; NOAH:</small> &#x003C; One &#x003E; <small>NOAH</small> is<sup><xref rid="fn146">24</xref></sup> concerning this world; &#x003C; the other &#x003E; <small>NOAH</small> is concerning the world to come. The Holy One said: When we come to comfort Jerusalem, I have sworn by the righteousness of Noah never again to enslave its children. Thus it is stated (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS AS THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME: &#x003C; AS I SWORE THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH SHOULD NEVERMORE GO OVER THE EARTH, SO I SWEAR THAT I WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOU OR REBUKE YOU &#x003E;.</small></p>
<title>2.7 Genesis 8:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. [Let our master instruct us: In the case of one who sees the bow in the clouds, what blessing must he say?<sup><xref rid="fn147">25</xref></sup> Thus] have our masters taught: One who sees a bow in the clouds must say a blessing. What blessing does he say? Blessed be the one who remembers the covenant, is trustworthy in his covenant, and has stood by his word. This is from the Mishnah,<sup><xref rid="fn148">26</xref></sup> but where is it shown from the Torah? The text reads (in Gen. 9:13): <small>I HAVE SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUD, AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN OF A COVENANT &#x003C; BETWEEN ME AND THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>. The conduct of the Holy One is not like the conduct of flesh and blood. In what respect? With flesh and blood, as long as one&#x2019;s close friend is alive, love has its place; and if one dies, love ceases. The Holy One, however, is not like that. When Abraham died, his (the Holy One&#x2019;s) love was preserved for his son Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: When someone poor seeks alms from a human, he gives him &#x003C; enough for &#x003E; a day or two, a month, or a year; but the Holy One gives a person food for as long as he lives.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: When the king loves someone, he honors him with silver, gold, and garments so as to make [him wealthy]. Then, while he is traveling by ship, the wind comes and destroys the ship. Where &#x003C; now &#x003E; is the king&#x2019;s gift? Here he had honored him and enriched him. Could he possibly have saved him from the sea? Or from robbers?<sup><xref rid="fn149">27</xref></sup> But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he gives one a gift, he protects him, as stated (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. He blessed Abraham and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>&#x003C; NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS &#x003E;, AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS</small>. He blessed Isaac and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. He blessed Jacob and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN [&#x2026; AND BLESSED HIM]</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Someone boards a ship and there are cattle with him. Now, if a storm arose at sea, what would they do? They would cast the cattle into the sea and save the human, since they do not take pity on cattle as they would take pity on a human. But the Holy One is not like that. Just as he takes pity upon the human, so he takes pity upon the cattle. You know yourself that this is so. When the Holy One wanted to destroy his world in the generation of the flood, when they had sinned, he considered humanity as equal to the cattle, since it is stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT [&#x2026; HUMANITY TOGETHER WITH CATTLE]</small>. When he came to be reconciled, just as he was reconciled to the children of Adam and took pity upon them; so he showed pity to the cattle, according to what we have read on the matter (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH &#x003C; &#x2026; AND ALL THE CATTLE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>2.8 Genesis 8:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> (literally: <small>MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>); &#x003C; <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP; HUMAN AND BEAST YOU DELIVER, O LORD &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn150">28</xref></sup> &#x003C; The passage&#x003E; is speaking allegorically about the righteous in their dwelling and speaking allegorically about the wicked in their dwelling. It speaks allegorically about the righteous [in their dwelling]. (So in Ezek. 34:14:) <small>I WILL FEED THEM IN A GOOD PASTURE, [AND UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF] &#x003C; THE LOFTY ONE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE THEIR FOLD &#x003E;</small>. It speaks allegorically about the wicked [in their dwelling]. (So in Ezek. 31:15:) <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD [GOD]: IN THE DAY THAT HE WENT DOWN TO SHEOL, I CAUSED HIM TO MOURN; [I COVERED HIM WITH THE DEEP]</small>. R. Judah bar Hama said: With what does one cover a vat? With &#x003C; a lid of &#x003E; its own kind &#x003C; of material &#x003E;. Certainly not with another article of silver or gold&#x0021; Thus Sheol is darkness, and the deep which covers it is darkness. The wicked also, who are in its midst, are darkness, as stated (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>. Darkness will come, and darkness will cover &#x003C; them up &#x003E;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. There is a story about R. Joshua bar Levi. When he went up to Rome and entered a certain palace,<sup><xref rid="fn151">29</xref></sup> he saw marble columns there which were covered with carpets<sup><xref rid="fn152">30</xref></sup> so that they would not crack in the heat and contract &#x003C; and break &#x003E; in the cold. He went out of there and found a certain poor person with a reed mat under him and a reed mat over him. Over the columns he cited (Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> (i.e., almsgiving) <small>IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Wherever you give, &#x003C; you &#x003E; bestow in abundance. Over the poor person he cited (ibid.): <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. Wherever you afflict, you deal strictly.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. R. Aqiva said: The righteousness (i.e., mercy) which you have appointed for us is for the world to come because we have received your judgments in this world.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>: These are the deeds of the righteous. As the mountains are &#x003C; clearly &#x003E; visible, so are the deeds of the righteous &#x003C; clearly &#x003E; visible, as stated (in Ps. 72:5): <small>&#x003C; BECAUSE &#x003E; THEY FEAR YOU, THEY ARE IN THE SUN</small>. (Ps 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the deeds of the wicked. As the deep is darkness, so are the works of the wicked, as stated (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. As the mountains are sown and bear fruit, so also the works of the righteous bear fruit. Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:10): <small>TELL THE RIGHTEOUS THAT &#x003C; ALL IS &#x003E; WELL, FOR THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WORKS</small>. (Ps. 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. As the deep neither is sown nor bears fruit, so also the works of the wicked do not bear fruit. Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:11): <small>WOE TO THE WICKED; &#x003C; ALL IS &#x003E; ILL</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn153">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. R. Simeon bar Johay said:<sup><xref rid="fn154">32</xref></sup> Just as the mountains hold down the deep so that it does not rise and flood the world, so righteousness holds down divine justice and retribution so that they do not come into the world. <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> is over your judgments as <small>THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> are over the great deep.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; &#x003C; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &#x003E;</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said: The righteousness (i.e., mercy) which you showed with Noah in the ark caused his ark to rest for him upon the mountains, as stated (in Gen. 8:4): <small>AND THE ARK RESTED [&#x2026; UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF ARARAT]. YOUR JUDGMENTS</small> are those which you carried out with the generation of the flood. You dealt strictly with them &#x003C; even &#x003E; unto the deep, as stated (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY [ALL THE FOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT DEEP] BURST APART</small>. Then after the retributions, behold &#x007B;it says&#x007D; (in Ps. 36:7 [6], end): <small>HUMAN AND BEAST YOU DELIVER, O LORD</small>. When? When (in Gen. 8:1) <small>GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>.</p>
<title>2.9 Genesis 8:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 8:1:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 10:7): <small>THE REMEMBRANCE OF A RIGHTEOUS ONE IS FOR A BLESSING</small>. This is Noah, concerning whom it is written (in Gen. 6:9): <small>A RIGHTEOUS MAN</small>. (Prov. 10:7, cont.:) <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>. This is the generation of the flood, which rotted from the world, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT &#x003C; ALL LIVING THINGS &#x003E;</small>. And what is the meaning of <small>HE BLOTTED OUT</small>? Compare what is stated (in Exod. 17:14): <small>FOR I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT &#x003C; THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Prov. 10:7): <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>.</p>
<title>2.10 Genesis 8:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH</small>. It is written (in Prov. 12:10): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE KNOWS THE SOUL OF HIS CATTLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn155">33</xref></sup> The righteous one of the world (i.e., God) even understands the soul of his cattle, even when he is angry. The characteristics the Holy One are not like flesh-and-blood character. In the case of flesh-and-blood character, when the province revolts against &#x003C; the king &#x003E;, he sends his legions<sup><xref rid="fn156">34</xref></sup> and destroys it. So he treats the good and the evil equally as one, as there is no one present to say: Such and such a person is blameless. Leave him alone. Instead one kills them all. But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when the whole generation was provoking him, so that he was angry with them, and when only a single righteous one was present, he saved him. Thus it says (in Prov. 12:10): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE KNOWS THE SOUL OF HIS CATTLE</small>. So also it says (in Nahum 1:7): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD, A STRONGHOLD IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; AND HE KNOWS THOSE SEEKING REFUGE IN HIM</small>. (Prov. 12:10, cont.:) <small>BUT THE COMPASSION OF THE WICKED IS CRUEL</small>. These &#x003C; wicked &#x003E; are the generation of the flood, since they were cruel. Our masters have said: When the Holy One caused the deep to arise and they saw the fountains rising up over them, what did they do? They had a lot of children. So each and every one, taking his child, set him on the deep; but the waters prevailed. Thus it says: <small>BUT THE COMPASSION OF THE WICKED IS CRUEL</small>. [And where is it shown that they did this?] Where Job said so (in Job 24:20): <small>COMPASSION FORSAKES HIM; THE WORM SWEETLY FEEDS ON HIM; IT SHALL NO LONGER BE REMEMBERED</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; the compassion of the one whose children they were.<sup><xref rid="fn157">35</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do to them? He brought a flood down upon them from above and destroyed them. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS DESTROYED AS A TREE</small>. R. Berekhyah said: They were more than solid enough, and they had &#x003C; physical &#x003E; height (rt.: <italic>QWM</italic>). Thus, if he had not punished them from above, the waters would not have overcome them. Thus Job has said (in Job 22:20): <small>SURELY OUR ADVERSARIES (rt.: <italic>QWM</italic>) WERE DESTROYED, AND FIRE HAS CONSUMED THEIR REMNANT</small>. How so? When the Holy One saw that they had not died in the ocean depths below, he brought down fire upon them from above, which burned them up. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>SURELY OUR ADVERSARIES WERE DESTROYED, &#x003C; AND FIRE CONSUMED THEIR REMNANT &#x003E;</small>. Moreover, the fowl, the cattle, and the wild animals turned on them and they diminished their numbers, as stated (in Gen. 7:21): <small>AND ALL FLESH WAS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER</small>&#x2026;. When they themselves saw that they were lost, they sought to overturn the ark. What did the Holy One do? He surrounded the ark with lionesses, which ate them, as stated (in Gen. 7:16): <small>AND THE LORD SHUT &#x003C; HIM &#x003E; IN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SHUT IN (rt.: <italic>SGR</italic>)</small>. &#x003C; Its meaning is &#x003E; like that used in the context (of Dan. 6:23 [22]): <small>MY GOD SENT THE</small><sup><xref rid="fn158">36</xref></sup> <small>ANGEL WHO SHUT (rt.: <italic>SGR</italic>) THE LIONS&#x2019; MOUTHS</small>.</p>
<title>2.11 Genesis 8:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH, &#x003C; ALL THE BEASTS, AND ALL THE CATTLE &#x003E;</small>. If he remembered Noah, why &#x003C; also &#x003E; the beasts and the cattle? May the name of the Holy One be blessed, who never deprives any creature of its reward. If even a mouse has preserved its family<sup><xref rid="fn159">37</xref></sup> and not intermingled with another species, it deserves to receive a reward. But all the people from the generation of the flood did mingle their families, as stated (in Gen. 6:12): <small>THEN GOD SAW THE WORLD; AND BEHOLD, IT WAS CORRUPT</small>. Thus, just as he had exacted retribution from the humans who had sinned, so he exacted retribution from the cattle, the beasts, and the fowl. And where is it shown that retribution was exacted from them? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT &#x003C; THE HUMANITY WHICH I CREATED FROM UPON THE FACE OF THE GROUND, HUMANITY TOGETHER WITH CATTLE, CREEPING THINGS, AND THE FOWL OF THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And why all those? In order to teach you that they also had mingled their families and were having intercourse with species that were not their own, each and every species with a species that was not its own. Then the Holy One called Noah and said to him: Choose for yourself cattle, beasts, and fowl [from those] who have not mingled their families, as stated (in Gen. 7:2): <small>FROM EVERY CLEAN BEAST</small>, &#x003C; those &#x003E; just as clean as when they were created. Then, when they went out from the ark, the Holy One testified concerning them that they had not mingled their families. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 8:19): <small>THEY WENT OUT BY THEIR FAMILIES</small>. The Holy One, therefore, remembered them along with Noah, as stated (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH, &#x003C; ALL THE BEASTS, AND ALL THE CATTLE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>2.12 Genesis 8:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 8:1, cont.:) <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS &#x003C; OVER THE EARTH</small> &#x003E;. &#x007B;Which wind? The Holy One passes over the wind&#x007D; [Which one? The Holy One caused a wind to pass over the earth] and over the waters. Thus he restored them just as they were at their beginning. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS OVER THE EARTH, [AND THE WATERS SUBSIDED]</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 1:2): <small>AND THE WIND OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER FACE OF THE WATERS</small>. That very wind he caused to pass over them, and immediately they settled down.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:1): <small>AND GOD CAUSED A WIND TO PASS OVER THE EARTH, AND THE WATERS SUBSIDED</small>. They <small>SUBSIDED</small> in that the Holy One cooled his anger, [in the same way] that it is stated (in Esth. 7:10): <small>AND THE ANGER OF THE KING SUBSIDED</small>. And so he is going to do when he exacts retribution from the wicked and eradicates them from the world; however, he is creating the righteous as a new creation and setting within them a spirit, of which it is stated (in Ezek. 37:14): <small>AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. David said (in Ps. 104:29): <small>WHEN YOU HIDE YOUR FACE, &#x007B;O LORD,&#x007D; THEY ARE TERRIFIED; &#x003C; WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THEIR SPIRIT, THEY PERISH AND RETURN UNTO THEIR DUST &#x003E;</small>. These are the wicked; but in regard to the righteous (according to Ps. 104:30): <small>WHEN YOU SEND FORTH YOUR SPIRIT, THEY ARE CREATED</small>. The Holy One said: In this world I exacted retribution from the wicked because they rebelled against me and I eradicated them from the world; but for Noah, his children, [and his descendants] I have done a good deed. Also, in the world to come I am exacting retribution from the wicked and doing a good deed for the righteous, for so has Isaiah stated (in Is. 40:10): <small>BEHOLD, THE LORD GOD COMES IN MIGHT</small>&#x2026;. These &#x003C; words &#x003E; concern the nations of the world. For the righteous, however, (these words of ibid., cont. apply): <small>BEHOLD HIS REWARD IS WITH HIM AND HIS RECOMPENSE BEFORE HIM</small>.</p>
<title>2.13 Genesis 8:15ff., Part I</title>
<p>[(Gen. 8:15:) <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH, SAYING: GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.] &#x007B;Our masters have taught&#x007D; [Let our master instruct us]: Is it permitted &#x003C; for one &#x003E; to put tasteless spittle<sup><xref rid="fn160">38</xref></sup> upon the eye on the Sabbath?<sup><xref rid="fn161">39</xref></sup> R. Hiyya bar Abba said: It is forbidden to put tasteless spittle upon the eye on the Sabbath because he would be like one who heals on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn162">40</xref></sup> Come and see that there is no affliction in the world for which there is no cure. Then what is the cure for the evil drive? Repentance. R. Judah bar Shallum said in the name of R. Eliezer: Three things nullify a harsh decree.<sup><xref rid="fn163">41</xref></sup> These are the following: prayer, repentance, and almsgiving. R. Huna b. R. Jose said: Also a change of name and good works. For that reason the Holy One was waiting for the generation of the flood, in case they should repent and he accept them. But since they did not repent, he blotted them out with water, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. He left Noah and his sons as a remnant in the ark. When the waters came to rest, Noah had to go out of the ark. Noah said, however: I entered with authorization [from the Holy One], as stated (in Gen. 7:1): <small>COME YOU &#x003C; AND ALL YOUR HOUSE INTO THE ARK &#x003E;</small>. So shall I now go out without authorization? The Holy One said to him: Are you seeking permission? Here is permission for you, &#x007B;as stated&#x007D; [concerning which we have read on the matter] (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.</p>
<title>2.14 Genesis 8:15ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 8:16:) <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn164">42</xref></sup> &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; is speaking about Noah when he was in the ark. Noah said to the Holy One: <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>; for he had been imprisoned there. R. Levi said: The whole twelve months that Noah was in the ark, neither he nor his children tasted a bit of sleep because they were responsible for feeding the cattle and the wild animals. R. Abba bar Kahana said:<sup><xref rid="fn165">43</xref></sup> He brought branches for the elephants and glass for the ostriches into the ark to feed the cattle and the wild animals. Now some of them ate in the second hour of the night, and some of them ate in the third hour of the day. Hence you yourself know that Noah did not taste a bit of sleep. R. Johanan said in the name of R. Eleazar b. R. Jose the Galilean: One time, when Noah was late in feeding the lion, the lion bit him; and he went away limping. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND NOAH ONLY [SURVIVED]</small>. R. Huna said in the name of R. Jose: When Noah went forth from the ark, he gave a heartfelt groan. He therefore said (according to Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON&#x2026;. THROUGH ME SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS WEAR A CROWN</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; through me shall the righteous take up a crown in the world. For they said: What&#x0021; If in the case of Noah, who was righteous [but not completely righteous], the Holy One so performed miracles for him&#x2014;Thus it is stated (in Job 22:30): <small>HE SHALL DELIVER THE ONE THAT IS NOT INNOCENT, AND HE SHALL BE DELIVERED [THROUGH THE PURITY OF YOUR HANDS]</small>, since he was innocent and not innocent. R. Hanina b. R. Aha said: <italic>Uncia</italic><sup><xref rid="fn166">44</xref></sup> (i.e., a little) merit was in him.<sup><xref rid="fn167">45</xref></sup> &#x003C; If God did miracles for Noah &#x003E;, how much the more, in the case of one who &#x007B; was &#x007D; [is] completely righteous, would the Holy One perform miracles for him. Thus it says (in Ps. 142:8 [7]): <small>THROUGH ME SHALL THE RIGHTEOUS WEAR A CROWN, FOR YOU SHALL REWARD ME</small>.</p>
<p>R. Judah bar Il&#x2018;ay said: If I had been there, I should have broken the ark to get myself out of there.</p>
<p>(Gen. 8:5:) <small>IN THE TENTH MONTH ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH THE TOPS OF THE MOUNTAINS BECAME VISIBLE</small>, but he did not go out from there. Instead he waited in the ark for him (i.e., for the Holy One) to give him permission. The Holy One said to him: Are you seeking permission? (Gen. 8:16:) <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.</p>
<title>2.15 Genesis 8:15ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:2-3): <small>I &#x003C; SAY &#x003E;: KEEP THE KING&#x2019;S COMMAND, AND BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, &#x003C; DO NOT BE DISMAYED &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn168">46</xref></sup> The Holy Spirit said to them: I made you swear that if a kingdom makes decrees over you, you shall not rebel against it in respect to anything which it has commanded concerning you. Rather, <small>I &#x003C; SAY &#x003E;: KEEP THE KING&#x2019;S COMMAND</small>. However, if it commands you to abolish the Torah, the commandments and the Sabbath, do not obey them. <small>I &#x003C; SAY &#x003E; KEEP THE KING&#x2019;S COMMAND</small>, in respect to anything which is necessary, but <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, DO NOT BE DISMAYED. LEAVE HIS PRESENCE; [DO NOT REMAIN IN SOMETHING EVIL]</small>. Why? Because they will not separate you from the commandments, unless you deny the Holy One. Ergo: <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD</small>. And thus did Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah do when Nebuchadnezzar set up the image. They said to him: What do you think? That when you cast us into the midst of a fiery furnace, the Holy One will not save us? Whether he saves or does not save us, we will not bow down to the image. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 3:17): <small>IF OUR GOD WHOM WE SERVE IS ABLE TO SAVE US, HE SHALL SAVE US FROM THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE AND FROM YOUR HAND. O KING</small>. It is also written after this (in vs. 18): <small>BUT IF NOT, BE IT KNOWN TO YOU, O KING, THAT WE SHALL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS NOR PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to them: Are you telling the truth? It is so stated (in vs. 14): <small>IS IT TRUE, SHADRACH, MESHACH, &#x003C; AND ABEDNEGO &#x003E;</small>? They said to him: <small>WE DO NOT &#x007B;CARE&#x007D; [NEED] TO ANSWER YOU IN THIS MATTER</small>. They said to him: With respect to whatever you may decree for us, crop taxes,<sup><xref rid="fn169">47</xref></sup> imposts, poll taxes, we shall obey you; but with regard to denying the Holy One, we will not obey you. (Eccl. 8:2f.:) <small>BECAUSE OF THE OATH OF GOD, DO NOT BE DISMAYED. LEAVE HIS PRESENCE</small>. When he heard that from them, he began to be angry, as stated (in Dan. 3:19): <small>THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR WAS FILLED WITH RAGE</small>. When they had heated the furnace, they threw them in bound. When they had descended into the midst of the furnace, they raised their eyes to the Holy One, Blessed Be He, and said: Sovereign of the Universe, you know that we have not trusted in our works but in your name. (Ps. 115:1:) <small>NOT UNTO US, O LORD, NOT UNTO US, BUT UNTO YOUR NAME GIVE GLORY</small>&#x2026;. Behold now, this wicked man had assembled all the tongues, as stated (in Dan. 3:3): <small>THEN WERE ASSEMBLED THE SATRAPS</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;(Ps. 115:2:) <small>WHY SHOULD THE NATIONS SAY &#x003C; WHERE NOW IS THEIR GOD &#x003E;</small> ?&#x007D; Immediately the angels wanted to go down to free them. The Holy One said to them: Was it for your name that they descended (into the furnace)? For my name they descended, and I will descend to free them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 146:7): <small>[THE ONE WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED]&#x2026;. THE LORD FREES THOSE WHO ARE BOUND</small>. The Holy One freed them immediately, flooded the furnace, and raised them up.<sup><xref rid="fn170">48</xref></sup> Then he leveled it (the furnace) to the ground, since it was deep. When the angel saw that, he said to them: Come out of there; for behold, the Holy One has freed you, performed miracles for you, and leveled the furnace to the ground. Come forth&#x0021; They said to him: We are not coming forth without Nebuchadnezzar lest they say: They fled from the furnace. (Eccl. 8:2:) <small>I &#x003C; SAY &#x003E;: KEEP THE KING&#x2019;S COMMAND</small>: With his permission we entered into here, and with his permission we are going forth. When Nebuchadnezzar came and saw them, he was astonished. He began crying out to them, as stated (in Dan. 3:26): <small>HE SPOKE AND SAID: SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO, SERVANTS OF THE GREAT GOD [GET OUT AND COME]</small>. &#x201C;Get out and come up&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>GET OUT AND COME</small>. Hence &#x003C; one may conclude &#x003E; that the furnace was leveled to the ground. They immediately said to the king: Now we will leave. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEN SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO CAME OUT [FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE]</small>. From whom had they learned &#x003C; what to do &#x003E;? From Noah, who had entered the ark with the permission of the Holy One. Now it is stated (in Gen. 8:15-16): <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>. For when the earth had dried out and the ark had come to rest, as stated (in Gen. 8:4): <small>SO THE ARK CAME TO REST</small>, his sons said to him: Let us go out. He said to them: Heaven forbid&#x0021; With the permission of the Holy One we entered, and with the permission of the Holy One we will leave. When the Holy One heard that, he immediately gave them permission, as stated (in Gen. 8:15-16): <small>AND GOD SPOKE UNTO NOAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.</p>
<title>2.16 Genesis 8:15ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 12:13): <small>IN THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LIPS LIES A SNARE FOR THE &#x007B;WICKED&#x007D; [EVIL], BUT A RIGHTEOUS ONE WENT FORTH FROM TROUBLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn171">49</xref></sup> <small>IN THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LIPS LIES A SNARE FOR THE WICKED</small>. These are the generation of the flood who had sinned through their mouths, as stated (in Job 21:14-15): <small>[YET THEY SAID TO GOD, GET AWAY FROM US]&#x2026;. WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM?</small> Ergo (in Prov. 12:13): <small>IN THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LIPS LIES A SNARE FOR THE WICKED</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT EVERY LIVING CREATURE</small>&#x2026;. (Prov. 12:13:) <small>BUT A RIGHTEOUS ONE WENT FORTH FROM TROUBLE</small>. This one is Noah, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WAS A RIGHTEOUS MAN, PERFECT</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK</small>.</p>
<title>2.17 Genesis 8:15ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (Gen. 8:16): <small>[GO FORTH FROM THE ARK].</small> David said to the Holy One (in Ps. 142:8 [7]): Sovereign of the World, <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn172">50</xref></sup> When Noah was within the ark, he prayed constantly. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 32:6): <small>THEREFORE, LET EVERY SAINT PRAY TO YOU IN A TIME WHEN YOU MAY BE FOUND, THAT WHEN THE GREAT WATERS OVERFLOW, THEY WILL NOT REACH HIM</small>. And what did he pray? <small>BRING MY SOUL OUT OF PRISON</small>. The Holy One said to him: It is a decree from me that twelve months be fulfilled (in the ark). Unless they are fulfilled, you are not going forth. Even so Isaiah has stated (in Is. 49:8f.): <small>IN AN ACCEPTABLE TIME I HAVE ANSWERED YOU &#x2026; SAYING TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND: GO FORTH</small>. These (who were bound) are Noah and his sons, who were prohibited (literally: bound) from sexual intercourse.<sup><xref rid="fn173">51</xref></sup> Joseph also acted in this way when he saw the years of famine that were going to come.<sup><xref rid="fn174">52</xref></sup> He engaged in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying before they came, as stated (in Gen. 41:50): <small>AND UNTO JOSEPH WERE BORN TWO SONS BEFORE THE YEAR OF FAMINE CAME</small>. Likewise Noah and his sons, the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl acted in this way.<sup><xref rid="fn175">53</xref></sup> They did not engage in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying when they had entered the ark, for so had the Holy One commanded them when they had entered the ark. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 7:7): <small>AND THERE WENT INTO THE ARK NOAH AND HIS SONS</small>, the males by themselves; <small>ALSO HIS WIFE AND HIS SONS&#x2019; WIVES</small>, the females by themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn176">54</xref></sup> Thus all the days that Noah was in the ark, Noah, his sons, and all who were with him were prohibited (literally: bound) from sexual intercourse. The Holy One said to them: How can I be destroying the world in anger while you are building it up&#x0021; When the flood passes on, however, you will engage in sexual intercourse for being fruitful and multiplying, as stated (in Is. 49:9): <small>SAYING TO THOSE WHO ARE BOUND</small> (i.e., <small>PROHIBITED</small>): <small>GO FORTH</small>. So, when the earth had become dry, the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 8:16): <small>GO FORTH FROM THE ARK, [YOU AND YOUR WIFE]</small> (with male and female mentioned together). Thus he released (i.e., permitted) them to be fruitful and multiply. And he also released the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>AND LET THEM ABOUND IN THE EARTH, BE FRUITFUL, AND MULTIPLY</small>. Noah said to him: Sovereign of the World, might you possibly bring &#x003C; another &#x003E; flood to the world? He said to him: Thus have I sworn: I am not bringing another flood, as stated (in Gen. 8:21): <small>THEN THE LORD SMELLED THE PLEASING ODOR; SO THE LORD SAID IN HIS HEART: I WILL NOT AGAIN CURSE THE GROUND ANY MORE</small>&#x2026;. How did he swear to him? Our masters say he swore to him by the covenant of Abraham, which is cited (in Neh. 9:7): <small>AND YOU MADE A COVENANT WITH HIM</small> (Abraham). So also Isaiah said (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS LIKE THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME: [AS I SWORE THAT THE WATERS OF NOAH WOULD NEVERMORE GO OVER THE EARTH]</small>. You find, nevertheless, that forty days in every year these waters made a mark on the world until Solomon arose and built the Temple. Then those forty days ceased, as stated (in I Kings 6:38): <small>AND IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR IN THE MONTH OF BUL &#x2026; &#x003C; THE HOUSE WAS FINISHED &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL</small>? In the month that the cattle are given mixed fodder (<italic>BLYM</italic>) from the house.<sup><xref rid="fn177">55</xref></sup> Another interpretation: <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL</small>: In the time that the earth turns into clods (<italic>bulim bulim</italic>). Another interpretation: <small>IN THE MONTH OF BUL: &#x003C; BUL &#x003E;</small> is lacking the letter M to correspond with the forty days that were cut off from the world.<sup><xref rid="fn178">56</xref></sup> Now, if the Holy One has sworn to Noah by the covenant of our father Abraham and fulfilled &#x003C; the oath &#x003E;, he will certainly fulfill the three oaths he has sworn to Zion. These are the three oaths: &#x007B;He swore by the covenant of our father Abraham, as stated (in Is. 54:9): <small>FOR THIS IS LIKE THE WATERS OF NOAH TO ME</small>.&#x007D; He swore by his own soul, so to speak, as stated (in Amos 6:8): <small>THE LORD GOD HAS SWORN BY HIS OWN SOUL</small>. He has also sworn by the Sabbath (<italic>ShBT</italic>), as stated (in Exod. 31:17): <small>&#x003C; IT &#x003E; (the Sabbath) IS A SIGN BETWEEN ME AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FOREVER; FOR IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH, AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE RESTED (<italic>ShBT</italic>) AND WAS REFRESHED</small>. &#x007B;And it is written&#x007D; [And he has sworn by Torah, as stated] (in Is. 62:8): <small>THE LORD HAS SWORN BY HIS RIGHT HAND</small>. This is Torah, as stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND A FIERY LAW (<italic>dat</italic>) FOR THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn179">57</xref></sup> And what did he swear to Jerusalem? That he would build it up. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 147:2): <small>THE LORD BUILDS UP JERUSALEM</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: It is an aggadic tradition that Jerusalem will not be built up until all the exiles are gathered. If someone says to you that all the exiles have been gathered but Jerusalem is not built up, do not believe &#x003C; him &#x003E;, since it is stated: <small>THE LORD BUILDS UP JERUSALEM</small>, and afterwards (ibid., cont.): <small>HE GATHERS THE EXILED ONES OF ISRAEL</small>. Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, has not Jerusalem already been built up and destroyed? He said to them: It was destroyed and you went into exile from it because of your sins. Now, however, I will build it up and never destroy it, as stated (in Ps. 102:17 [16]): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS BUILT UP ZION; HE HAS APPEARED IN HIS GLORY</small>.</p>

<p>(Gen. 9:18:) <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &#x003C; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &#x003E; WERE &#x003C; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn180">58</xref></sup> [Let our master instruct us: Who is the one commanded about being fruitful and multiplying, the man or the woman? Thus] have our masters taught (in <italic>Yev</italic>. 6:6): <small>THE MAN IS COMMANDED ABOUT BEING FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYING BUT NOT THE WOMAN</small>. R. Johanan ben Baroqah says: It says concerning both of them (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM, [AND GOD SAID TO THEM: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn181">59</xref></sup> However, the man is commanded more than the woman. You know yourself that it is so. Look at how Abraham showed a lot of determination in taking a wife for his son Isaac; for thus it says (in Gen. 24:2-4): <small>SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE &#x2026; AND I WILL MAKE YOU SWEAR BY THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE HEAVENS &#x2026; THAT YOU &#x003C; GO &#x003E; UNTO MY LAND &#x003C; WHERE I WAS BORN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Thus Abraham showed determination about being fruitful and multiplying. So also Isaac sent Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 28:2): <small>ARISE, GO TO PADDAN-ARAM, TO THE HOUSE OF BETHUEL</small>. He sent him to take a wife who was suitable for him. &#x003C; In doing so he was &#x003E; unlike the people of the flood generation, who were lecherous, who were going for what was indecent for them. See what is written (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE DIVINE SONS SAW &#x003C; HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES</small> &#x003E;. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as they have done this, let them perish from the earth. But why were the cattle destroyed with them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>BOTH HUMAN AND CATTLE</small>? Because the cattle also were acting immorally and going with species that were not their own, the horse with the donkey, the lion with the bull, the snake with the lizard.<sup><xref rid="fn182">60</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 6:12): <small>THEN GOD SAW THE EARTH, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS CORRUPT; [FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED ITS WAY UPON THE EARTH]</small>. It does not say &#x201C;Every person,&#x201D; but <small>ALL FLESH</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; even the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl. Therefore, they were blotted out along with them. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Just as none but the righteous entered the ark,<sup><xref rid="fn183">61</xref></sup> so the cattle, wild beasts, and fowl who were with them were righteous, as stated (in Gen. 8:19): <small>&#x003C; THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &#x003E; BY THEIR FAMILIES</small>. Do cattle have families? Only those cattle who had not joined themselves to another species entered the ark; therefore, the Holy One ascribed a lineage for them. So, if cattle, wild beasts, and fowl, who are nothing, were ascribed a lineage, was it not proper for Noah and his sons to be ascribed a lineage? The Holy One immediately ascribed them a &#x007B;lineage, according to what is written&#x007D; [lineage. Where is it shown? In what we have read] on the matter (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE SONS OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE &#x003C; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>2.19 Genesis 9:18ff., Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &#x003C; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &#x003E; EXISTED</small>.] This text is related (to Ezek. 26:21): <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE; YOU SHALL BE SOUGHT, BUT YOU SHALL NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN, SAYS THE LORD GOD</small>. &#x003C; The text &#x003E; is speaking about the nations of the world. What is the meaning of <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE</small>? The nations of the world had no existence and are not going to exist, as stated: <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO HORRORS, AND YOU ARE NO MORE. HORRORS (<italic>BLHWT</italic>)</small> means &#x201C;not to exist&#x201D; (<italic>BLHYWT</italic>); <small>AND YOU ARE NO MORE</small> now. <small>YOU SHALL BE SOUGHT, BUT YOU SHALL NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN</small> in the world to come. But Israel had existence and is also going to exist. It existed before the world was created, as stated (in Ps. 74:2): <small>REMEMBER YOUR CONGREGATION WHICH YOU ACQUIRED OF OLD</small>. And it exists now, as stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY, ALL OF YOU</small>. You are also going to exist, as stated (in Mal. 3:17): <small>AND THEY SHALL BE MINE, SAYS THE LORD &#x007B;GOD&#x007D; [OF HOSTS], ON THE DAY THAT I PREPARE A PERSONAL TREASURE</small>. The nations of the world, however, had horrors (i.e., nonexistence) in that they did not exist in the world; but the children of Noah did have &#x007B;purification&#x007D; [existence] in the world, as stated (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &#x003C; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &#x003E; EXISTED</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &#x003C; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &#x003E; WERE &#x003C; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &#x003E;</small>. R. Levi said: It was by virtue of what they had done in the ark that they went forth from the ark. But &#x003C; specifically &#x003E; for what? The whole twelve months that they spent in the ark they had been girding up their loins and feeding the cattle and the beasts. So it was by virtue of this that they went forth from the ark.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; (in Gen. 9:18): <small>THE CHILDREN OF NOAH, WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK, WERE [SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH]</small>. Was Shem really the oldest in that he comes first? Is it not also written (in Gen. 10:21): &#x003C; <small>AND UNTO SHEM &#x003E; &#x2026; THE BROTHER OF JAPHETH, WHO WAS THE OLDEST</small>? Why &#x003C; then &#x003E; did Shem precede Japheth? Because he was worthy (<italic>kasher</italic>) and virtuous for his creator.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:18, cont.:) <small>AND HAM IS THE FATHER OF CANAAN</small>. There is a tradition that R. Berekhyah said: <small>HAM IS THE FATHER OF CANAAN</small>: He is the father of a <italic>peroah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn184">62</xref></sup> &#x007B;(Gen. 9:19:) <small>THESE THREE WERE THE SONS OF NOAH</small>.&#x007D;</p>
<title>2.20 Genesis 9:18ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 9:20:) <small>NOW NOAH, THE MAN OF THE LAND, WAS THE FIRST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WAS THE FIRST (rt.: <italic>HLL</italic>)</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn185">63</xref></sup> That he <small>BECAME PROFANE (rt.: <italic>HLL</italic>). THE MAN OF THE LAND</small>: R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: &#x003C; He was known as <small>THE MAN OF THE LAND</small> just as &#x003E; a man is &#x003C; known as &#x003E; the son of a man.<sup><xref rid="fn186">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>THE MAN OF THE LAND</small>, in that because of him the earth survived.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:20, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; NOW NOAH &#x2026; WAS THE FIRST &#x003E; TO PLANT A VINEYARD</small>. This man was one of four mortals who were first in four things.<sup><xref rid="fn187">65</xref></sup> Noah was first with planting, with drunkenness, with cursing, and with slavery:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x007B;With slavery, as stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>A SLAVE OF SLAVES &#x003C; SHALL HE BE TO HIS BROTHERS</small> &#x003E;.&#x007D;</li>
<li>[With planting, as stated (in Gen. 9:20): <small>&#x003C; NOW NOAH &#x2026; WAS THE FIRST &#x003E; TO PLANT A VINEYARD</small>.]</li>
<li>With drunkenness, as stated (in vs. 21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK</small>.</li>
<li>[With cursing, as stated (in vs. 25): <small>CURSED BE CANAAN</small>.]</li>
<li>[With slavery, as stated (ibid.): <small>A SLAVE OF SLAVES &#x003C; SHALL HE BE TO HIS BROTHERS &#x003E;</small>.]</li>
</ul>
<p>Abraham was first with aging,<sup><xref rid="fn188">66</xref></sup> with trials, with an inn,<sup><xref rid="fn189">67</xref></sup> and with a <italic>legatum</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn190">68</xref></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>With aging: When the father and the son would enter a city, no one knew whom to honor. The Holy One said: By your life, I am beginning &#x003C; the aging process &#x003E; with you, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS AGED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn191">69</xref></sup></li>
<li>With trials: Where is it shown? Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you had not given contentment to the generation of the flood, they would not have provoked you to anger. But, if you had brought trials upon them, they would not have rebelled against you. The Holy One said to him: With you I am beginning to have one suffer trials through his child. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:8.): <small>SO THE CHILD</small> (Isaac) <small>GREW AND WAS WEANED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn192">70</xref></sup> &#x007B;R. Joshua&#x007D; [R. Osha&#x2018;ya] and R. Abbin differed.<sup><xref rid="fn193">71</xref></sup> The one said that he was weaned from trials. The other said that he was weaned from the evil drive to the good drive.</li>
<li>With an inn, according to what is written (in Gen. 21:33): <small>AND AT BEER-SHEBA HE PLANTED AN <italic>ESHEL</italic></small>, i.e., an inn.<sup><xref rid="fn194">72</xref></sup></li>
<li>With a <italic>legatum</italic> &#x007B;i.e., a gift&#x007D;: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 25:6): <small>BUT TO ABRAHAM&#x2019;S SONS BY CONCUBINES ABRAHAM GAVE GIFTS</small>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moses was first with the priesthood, with the pulpit, with the sacrifices, and with the Torah.</p>
<ul>
<li>[With the priesthood, when he served in the high priesthood for the seven days during the consecration (of Aaron and his sons.)]<sup><xref rid="fn195">73</xref></sup></li>
<li>With the pulpit, when he had Eleazar stand on the pulpit. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 3:32): <small>AND THE PRINCE OF THE LEVITE PRINCES WAS ELEAZAR</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn196">74</xref></sup></li>
<li>With the sacrifices: Where is it shown? (Lev. 8:21): <small>MOSES SACRIFICED THE [WHOLE] RAM UPON THE ALTAR</small> (during the consecration of Aaron and his sons).</li>
<li>With the Torah: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 24:12): <small>COME UP TO ME ON THE MOUNTAIN [AND BE THERE, AND I WILL GIVE YOU STONE TABLETS WITH TORAH AND THE COMMANDMENTS WHICH I HAVE WRITTEN FOR THEIR INSTRUCTION</small>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Balaam was first with a brothel, with playing dice,<sup><xref rid="fn197">75</xref></sup> with gladiatorial games,<sup><xref rid="fn198">76</xref></sup> and with divinations. Thus Noah was one of four mortals who were first in four things.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:20:) <small>&#x003C; NOW NOAH &#x2026; WAS THE FIRST &#x003E; TO PLANT A VINEYARD. FROM WHERE DID HE GET IT</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn199">77</xref></sup> From grape pips which he brought along into the ark. &#x003C; These &#x003E; he took and sowed, as stated: <small>&#x003C; NOW NOAH &#x2026; WAS THE FIRST &#x003E; TO PLANT A VINEYARD</small>&#x2026;. And what is written next (in vs. 21)? <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE</small>. R. Hiyya bar Abba said:<sup><xref rid="fn200">78</xref></sup> The very day that he planted it was the day it produced blossoms. On that day it produced fruit; on that day he plucked it, harvested it, tread upon it, and drank. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 9:21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK; AND HE WAS EXILED WITHIN HIS TENT</small>. The written text reads <small>HER TENT (<italic>oholah</italic>)</small>. R. Judah b. R. Simon said in the name of R. Hanina in the name of R. Samuel bar Isaac: It ordained exile for ten of the tribes, since it is stated (in Ezek. 23:4): <small>SAMARIA IS OHOLAH</small>.</p>
<title>2.21 Genesis 9:18ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 9:22:) <small>THEN HAM, THE FATHER OF CANAAN, SAW &#x003C; THE NAKEDNESS OF HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIS TWO BROTHERS OUTSIDE &#x003E;</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum said in the name of R. Jacob bar Zavday, who had said in the name of R. Abbahu:<sup><xref rid="fn201">79</xref></sup> Ham saw with his eyes and told with his mouth. For that reason, the Holy One said: If one of the slaves is struck in his eye or in his tooth, he is to go free, as stated (in Exod. 21:26f.): <small>IF SOMEONE STRIKES [THE EYE OF] HIS SLAVE, &#x003C; MALE OR FEMALE, AND DESTROYS IT, HE SHALL LET HIM GO FREE&#x2026;. AND IF HE KNOCKS OUT THE TOOTH OF HIS SLAVE, MALE OR FEMALE, HE SHALL LET HIM GO FREE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:23:) <small>THEN HE, SHEM AND JAPHETH, TOOK A GARMENT</small>. R. Johanan said: &#x201C;Then they took&#x201D; is not stated here, but <small>THEN HE TOOK</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn202">80</xref></sup> Shem first showed his courage [in the worthy act] and afterwards Japheth. Ergo: <small>THEN HE, SHEM AND JAPHETH, TOOK A GARMENT</small>.</p>
<p>(Ibid.:) <small>AND THEY WALKED BACKWARDS</small>. Thus they were walking with their backs forward so that their coming was the same as their going. (Ibid., end:) <small>AND THEY DID NOT SEE THEIR FATHER&#x2019;S NAKEDNESS</small>. He gave them their reward,<sup><xref rid="fn203">81</xref></sup> a fringed &#x003C; Jewish &#x003E; shawl for Shem and a Greek cloak<sup><xref rid="fn204">82</xref></sup> for Japheth.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:25:) <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Ham looked; is Canaan cursed?<sup><xref rid="fn205">83</xref></sup> R. Judah said: The curse does not coexist with a blessing. &#x003C; Ham could not be cursed &#x003E; because it is stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED [NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. R. Nehemiah said:] Canaan had looked and told his father; so the curse had returned to its source. For that reason it is stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Our masters have said: When Noah was in the ark, he said: Oh, that my children had slaves so that, while they were seated, those &#x003C; slaves &#x003E; would go forth before them. When, however, I go out from the ark, whomever I beget I shall make into slaves for them. He said to him (Ham): You did not allow me to beget a fourth son who would be a slave for his brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn206">84</xref></sup> By your life, I am making your fourth son a slave. Thus it stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN; [A SLAVE OF SLAVES SHALL HE BE TO HIS BROTHERS]</small>. Resh Laqish said: Behold, those from Ham are slaves forever, but the children of Shem go forth into the world free. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 15:12, 17): <small>IF THERE IS SOLD TO YOU &#x003C; A FELLOW HEBREW, MAN OR WOMAN &#x2026; IN THE SEVENTH YEAR YOU SHALL SET HIM FREE &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN YOU SHALL TAKE AN AWL &#x003C; AND PUT IT THROUGH HIS EAR INTO THE DOOR &#x003E;</small>. What is written there (in vs. 17)? <small>AND HE SHALL BE YOUR SLAVE FOREVER</small>. Here, however, is a slave of slaves, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; a slave who does not take his freedom and never goes away. What caused this curse for him? &#x003C; It came about &#x003E; because he had treated his father with contempt. So also the Holy One is going to exact punishment from the children of Ham and humiliate them at the hands of the king of Assyria, as stated (in Is. 20:4): <small>SO SHALL THE KING OF ASSYRIA DRIVE OFF &#x003C; THE CAPTIVES OF EGYPT AND THE EXILES OF NUBIA &#x003E; &#x2026; [NAKED AND BAREFOOT]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>NAKED AND BAREFOOT</small>? That he would humiliate them and parade them naked. Now, in regard to Japheth, who honored his father, how does the Holy One repay him? When Gog (Japheth&#x2019;s descendant) comes, the Holy One will overshadow him and cover him over, as stated (in Ezek. 39:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY THAT I WILL GIVE UNTO GOG A BURIAL PLACE THERE IN ISRAEL</small>. And how did he reward Shem? When the sons of Aaron came in to offer sacrifice, their bodies (according to Lev. 10:2) were burned but their clothes were not burned.<sup><xref rid="fn207">85</xref></sup> Why? Because they were children of Shem. That is how it is with the righteous. But where is it shown about the wicked? When Sennacherib went up to Jerusalem, and all his soldiers with him, their bodies were burned and their clothes were not burned. Why? Because they were children of Shem, as stated (in Gen. 10:22): <small>THE SONS OF SHEM ARE ELAM, ASSHUR, ARPACHSHAD, LUD, AND ARAM</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 9:27:) <small>MAY GOD ENLARGE (<italic>YPT</italic>) JAPHETH (<italic>YPT</italic>);</small> but, nevertheless, (ibid., cont.): <small>LET HIM DWELL IN THE TENTS OF SHEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn208">86</xref></sup> Now all these things happened because of the wine. Thus, wherever you find wine, you find a downfall. And so with Noah &#x003C; it was &#x003E; on account of wine. And likewise with the tribes. When they sat down to eat, they sold their brother Joseph. So also in Shittim (according to Numb. 25:2): <small>AND &#x003C; THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB &#x003E; INVITED THE PEOPLE TO SACRIFICE TO THEIR GODS</small>. So also in the making of the golden calf, &#x003C; that too &#x003E; was on account of wine (according to Exod. 32:6): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK</small>. Moreover, the tribes only went into exile because of wine, as stated (in Is. 5:11): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO PURSUE STRONG DRINK</small>. (Amos 6:6:) <small>THOSE WHO DRINK &#x003C; STRAIGHT &#x003E; FROM THE WINE BOWLS</small>. And the tribes of Judah and Benjamin also only went into exile because of wine, as stated (in Is. 28:7): <small>AND THESE ALSO ARE MUDDLED BY WINE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world it has turned into a stumbling block, but in the world to come I am turning the wine into fresh grape juice, as stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn209">87</xref></sup></p>
<title>2.22 Genesis 11:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS</small>. Let our master instruct us: In regard to a house in which one establishes an <italic>&#x2018;eruv</italic>, is it correct that there must be an <italic>&#x2018;eruv</italic> or not?<sup><xref rid="fn210">88</xref></sup> R. Jacob bar Aha had questioned R. Abbahu.<sup><xref rid="fn211">89</xref></sup> He said to him: The Bet Shammay say one is necessary, while the Bet Hillel say it is not necessary; and a ruling (<italic>halakhah</italic>) is according to the Bet Hillel.<sup><xref rid="fn212">90</xref></sup> R. Joshua ben Levi said:<sup><xref rid="fn213">91</xref></sup> They only instituted the <italic>&#x2018;eruv</italic> of courtyards to foster ways of peace. In what way? A woman sends her child to her acquaintance (whom she dislikes for the <italic>&#x2018;eruv</italic> of courtyards). When she (the acquaintance) kisses and embraces him, his mother says: Indeed she does love me; so let my heart be with her. Thus it turns out that they make peace because of the <italic>&#x2018;eruv</italic>. The Holy One said: I put peace in my world, but these wicked ones arose to put in dissension. And where is it shown that they took issue with the Holy One? From what they have read on the matter (in Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS</small>. But the generation of the dispersion also arose and revolted against the Holy One when they sought to ascend to the firmament. They said: He has no right to choose the upper regions for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn214">92</xref></sup> They began to utter blasphemous words. &#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; [And where is it shown? From what we have read on the matter:] <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>2.23 Genesis 11:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 59:12 [11]): <small>DO NOT KILL THEM LEST MY PEOPLE FORGET; MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER AND BRING THEM DOWN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn215">93</xref></sup> Against whom did David speak this scripture? He spoke it against none other than Doeg and Ahithophel. David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, do not kill them by a death that you use on the rest of Adam&#x2019;s children; but &#x007B;make them wander in the world&#x007D; <small>[MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER]</small> to be homeless nomads in the world. <small>[AND BRING THEM DOWN:]</small> and bring them down from their arrogance. Why? (Ps. 5:11 [10]:) <small>BECAUSE THEY REBELLED AGAINST YOU</small>. (Ps. 59:13 [12]:) <small>FOR THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTH AND THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; that they had sinned with their mouth and again with their lips. Doeg said (in I Sam. 22:9): <small>I SAW THE SON OF JESSE COME TO NOB</small>&#x2026;. Ahithophel said to Absalom (in II Sam. 16:21): <small>GO IN TO YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S CONCUBINES&#x2026;.</small> &#x003C; That was &#x003E; <small>THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTH</small>, which they had sinned with their mouth. <small>THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small>: By the &#x003C; actual &#x003E; utterance on their lips. Ergo (in Ps. 59:13 [12], cont.): <small>&#x007B;THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THEIR SPEECH&#x007D; [LET THEM BE TRAPPED BY THEIR PRIDE]</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: He spoke it against none other than the generation of the dispersion. (Ps. 59:12 [11]:) <small>DO NOT KILL THEM</small> by the death that you used on the generation of the flood. Rather (ibid., cont.): <small>MAKE THEM WANDER BY YOUR POWER</small>. Make them homeless nomads in the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>. (Ps. 59:13 [12]:) <small>FOR THE SIN OF THEIR MOUTH</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; that they had sinned with their mouth. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WORD OF THEIR LIPS</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; that they had sinned with their lips. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>LET THEM BE TRAPPED BY THEIR PRIDE</small>. &#x007B;Thus it is stated.&#x007D;</p>
<title>2.24 Genesis 11:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 10:32)? <small>THESE ARE THE FAMILIES OF NOAH&#x2019;S DESCENDANTS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn216">94</xref></sup> Then after that &#x003C; comes &#x003E;: <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE</small>. Solomon has said (in Prov. 27:22): <small>IF YOU POUND THE FOOL IN A MORTAR WITH A PESTLE [ALONG WITH THE GRAIN, HIS FOLLY WILL NOT LEAVE HIM]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn217">95</xref></sup> In the case of one who beats the fool, while that one is raising the rod to give him a second blow, he forgets the first time. <small>WITH A PESTLE ALONG WITH THE GRAIN</small>: While he is raising &#x003C; the rod for &#x003E; the first time, it is already forgotten. Thus <small>HIS FOLLY WILL NOT LEAVE HIM</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 27:22): <small>IF YOU POUND THE FOOL IN A MORTAR</small>. R. Nehemiah the son of R. Samuel bar Nahman said: To what are they comparable? To a full bottle when locusts climb up on it. The first &#x003C; climbed up &#x003E; and fell. [The second &#x003C; climbed up &#x003E; and fell. The third &#x003C; climbed up &#x003E; and fell.] But the second did not learn from the first &#x007B;nor the second from the third&#x007D; [nor the third from the second]. So are the wicked. The first arises, grows powerful, and falls; but the second does not learn from the first. Thus the generation of Enosh arose and cried out to idols, as stated (in Gen. 4:26): <small>THEN THERE WAS PROFANATION IN CALLING &#x003C; OTHER GODS &#x003E; BY THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn218">96</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He called for the sea and flooded them, as stated (in Amos 5:8, 9:6): <small>THE ONE WHO CALLS FOR THE WATERS OF THE SEA AND POURS THEM OUT UPON THE FACE OF THE EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn219">97</xref></sup> The generation of the flood arose and provoked the Holy One to anger, as stated (in Job 21:14): <small>YET THEY SAID TO GOD: LEAVE US ALONE</small>. So they perished from the world and did not learn from the generation of Enosh. [The generation of the dispersion arose and did not learn from the former generations.] Ergo (in Prov. 27:22): <small>IF YOU POUND THE FOOL IN A MORTAR WITH A PESTLE, ALONG WITH THE GRAIN</small>. This is the generation of the dispersion, in that they were bringing forth words of blasphemy against the Unique One of the world, as stated (in Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>ONE LANGUAGE (<italic>SPH</italic>)</small>? That they were one family (rt.: <italic>ShPH</italic>). Another interpretation: <small>ONE LANGUAGE (<italic>SPH</italic>)</small>, in that they poured out (rt.: <italic>ShPH</italic>) retribution for the world. <small>[AND THE SAME WORDS</small>, which they uttered against the Unique One of the world.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 11:1): <small>AND THE SAME</small> (<italic>ehad</italic> in the plural) <small>WORDS</small>, which they uttered against two unique ones of the world:<sup><xref rid="fn220">98</xref></sup> Against the Holy One, according to what is written (in Deut. 6:4): <small>HEAR, O ISRAEL, THE LORD IS OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE (<italic>ehad</italic>)</small>. Also against Abraham, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE (<italic>ehad</italic>), &#x007B;AND HE LOVED HIM&#x007D;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD [ONE LANGUAGE]</small>. R. Ayyevu said in the name of R. Eleazer the son of R. Jose the Galilean: Those who come into the world have taken issue with the Holy One in three places:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once in the days of Joshua, as stated (in Josh. 9:2): <small>THEN &#x003C; ALL THE KINGS &#x003E; GATHERED TOGETHER [WITH ONE ACCORD] TO FIGHT AGAINST JOSHUA [AND AGAINST ISRAEL]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TOGETHER?</small> That they took issue with the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn221">99</xref></sup></li>
<li>Once in the days of Gog and Magog, as stated (in Ps. 2:2): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TAKE THEIR STAND &#x2026; &#x003C; AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn222">100</xref></sup></li>
<li>Here, as stated (in Gen. 11:1): <small>NOW THE WHOLE EARTH HAD [ONE LANGUAGE AND THE SAME WORDS]</small>, words of blasphemy &#x003C; which &#x003E; they were uttering against the Holy One. Even though the scriptures have not specified &#x003C; the blasphemies &#x003E;, our masters have specified some of them. What were they saying? After a thousand years and one day plus six hundred and fifty-six years, a flood is coming to the world.<sup><xref rid="fn223">101</xref></sup> Then the heavens are to be shaken, and the waters above shall fall upon us. But come and let us make ourselves <italic>purgoi</italic> &#x007B;i.e., columns&#x007D;,<sup><xref rid="fn224">102</xref></sup> so that if the heavens fall, they will support them. Ergo (in Gen. 11:1): <small>AND THE SAME WORDS</small>.</li>
</ol>
<title>2.25 Genesis 11:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 11:3:) <small>THEN THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO ONE ANOTHER</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn225">103</xref></sup> Ethiopia to Egypt, [Egypt to Put (of Libya)], Put to Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn226">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 11:4:) <small>COME, LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn227">105</xref></sup> The Holy One said to them: You have said: <small>COME</small>. By your life, with that very word I will descend upon you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 11:7): <small>COME, LET US DESCEND [AND CONFOUND THEIR LANGUAGE THERE]</small>. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: The tower was divided into three parts. A third was swallowed up, a third fell, and a third is standing even now.<sup><xref rid="fn228">106</xref></sup> One who ascends to its top sees the palms of Jericho &#x003C; looking &#x003E; like those locusts.</p>
<title>2.26 Genesis 11:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>You find that in the story of the flood generation &#x003C; their deeds &#x003E; were specified, but that in the story of the dispersion generation &#x003C; their deeds &#x003E; were not specified.<sup><xref rid="fn229">107</xref></sup> In reference to the story of the flood generation, Job has explained it where it is stated (in Job 24:2f.): <small>THEY DISPLACE BOUNDARIES, [THEY CARRY OFF FLOCKS AND PASTURE THEM], THEY DRIVE AWAY THE DONKEYS OF THE ORPHANS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THEY DISPLACE BOUNDARIES</small>? That one would enter another&#x2019;s boundary, and the other would enter the boundary of the first one. &#x003C; What is the meaning of &#x003E; <small>THEY CARRY OFF FLOCKS AND PASTURE THEM</small>? [That they were carrying off each other&#x2019;s flocks.] <small>THEY DRIVE AWAY THE DONKEYS OF THE ORPHANS</small>: When they saw a donkey in the hands of an orphan, they would immediately take it from him. (Job 24:3, cont.:) <small>THEY SEIZE THE WIDOW&#x2019;S OX AS A PLEDGE</small>, a widow whose husband had died and left her a single ox. When she went out to pasture it, they immediately would take it from her. (Job 24:7:) <small>THEY SPEND THE NIGHT NAKED WITHOUT CLOTHING</small>. When &#x003C; the other &#x003E; people saw that they were acting in this way, they would take off their clothes and go about naked. Moreover, a lot of things &#x003C; have been passed over &#x003E; merely so as not to bother you.<sup><xref rid="fn230">108</xref></sup></p>
<title>2.27 Genesis 11:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>How did the generation of the flood sin? Job 21:14:) <small>THEY SAID TO GOD: LEAVE US ALONE, [FOR WE WANT NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR WAYS]</small>. They said: We do not desire knowledge of Torah. (Ibid., vs. 15:) <small>WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM</small>? Why should we pray to him?</p>
<p>What did the people of the flood and the people of the dispersion generation resemble? A king who had two children. One said [to him]: I can stand neither you nor your troubles; and the second said to him: &#x003C; It&#x2019;s &#x003E; either you or I&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn231">109</xref></sup> So the people of the flood generation &#x007B;said&#x007D; (in Job 21:14): <small>[YET THEY SAID] TO GOD: LEAVE US ALONE</small>&#x2026;. The generation of &#x007B;the flood&#x007D; [the dispersion] said: &#x003C; It&#x2019;s either &#x003E; he or we. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 11:4): <small>COME, LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY</small>. They said: He has no right to choose the upper regions for himself and to assign us the lower regions. Come and let us exchange, so that we take the upper regions and he takes the lower regions.</p>
<title>2.28 Genesis 11:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 11:3:) <small>THEN THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER: COME, LET US FORM BRICKS</small>. The Holy One caused everything that they made to prosper in their hands in order to laugh at them in the end. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 2:4): <small>THE ONE SITTING IN THE HEAVENS SHALL LAUGH</small>. Now had they not built, they would have said: If we had built the tower, we should<sup><xref rid="fn232">110</xref></sup> have ascended to the heavens and fought with him.<sup><xref rid="fn233">111</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He made things prosper in their hands to make known that those in the world are nothing. Then after [that] he laughed at them and banished them, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM OUT OF THERE</small>. [(Gen. 11:4:) <small>THEN THEY SAID: COME, LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY AND A TOWER WITH ITS TOP IN THE HEAVENS TO MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELVES</small>.] R. Simeon bar Johay said: They took an idol and put it on top of the tower. [They said:] If the Holy One issues decrees against it, it will be against him and inhibit him. This expression, <small>MAKE A NAME FOR OURSELVES</small>, is nothing but an expression of idolatry. Thus is stated (in Exod. 23:13): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MENTION THE NAME OF OTHER GODS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn234">112</xref></sup> The Holy One said to them: You say (in Gen. 11:4, cont.): <small>LEST WE BE DISPERSED</small>. I am dispersing you. Thus it is stated (in vs. 8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>. &#x003C; This dispersing was &#x003E; to fulfill what is stated (in Prov. 10:24): <small>WHAT THE WICKED ONE FEARS SHALL COME UPON HIM</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 11:5:) <small>THEN THE LORD CAME DOWN TO LOOK &#x003C; AT THE CITY AND AT THE TOWER &#x003E;</small>. Everything is revealed to the Holy One; yet it is written here: <small>THEN THE LORD CAME DOWN TO LOOK</small>. &#x003C; He did so &#x003E; merely to teach people proper conduct, [i.e., not to decide a lawsuit nor talk about anything which they have not seen].</p>
<p>(Gen. 11:5, cont.:) <small>WHICH THE CHILDREN OF ADAM HAD BUILT</small>. He said to them: Are you not looking to the ancient ones which were before you? &#x007B;Thus it is stated in&#x007D; (Gen. 11:6:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: THEY ARE ONE PEOPLE AND THEY ALL HAVE ONE LANGUAGE &#x2026; [AND NOW NOTHING &#x003C; THEY PROPOSE &#x003E; WILL BE CUT OFF &#x003C; FROM THEM &#x003E;</small>]. Although they rebelled, I extended my right hand to them. So I said to them: Repent, and I will receive you, just as it is stated (in Deut. 10:12): <small>AND NOW, ISRAEL, WHAT DOES THE LORD YOUR GOD ASK [OF YOU]</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;?<sup><xref rid="fn235">113</xref></sup> But they said (in Gen. 11:6): <small>NOTHING &#x003C; THEY PROPOSE &#x003E; WILL BE CUT OFF FROM THEM</small>. Even if those people were cut off, they would not repent, as stated (in Jer. 6:9): <small>LIKE A VINTAGER OVER &#x003C; THE VINE &#x003E; SHOOTS</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Another interpretation of&#x007D; (Gen. 11:7:) <small>COME, LET US DESCEND [AND CONFOUND THEIR LANGUAGE THERE]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn236">114</xref></sup> When the Holy One mixed up their language, not one of them knew his companion&#x2019;s language. What was that language which they had been speaking? It was the holy language through which the world had been created. In this world nations and peoples take issue with the Holy One, but in the world to come all of them will be like a single shoulder for serving him. Thus it is stated (in Zeph. 3:9): <small>FOR THEN I WILL TURN OVER TO THE PEOPLES A PURE LANGUAGE [FOR ALL OF THEM TO INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD, TO SERVE HIM WITH A SINGLE SHOULDER</small> (i.e., with one accord)]. Why? Because the Holy One spoke thus to Israel: I will abolish oppression from you, destroy the nations on your account, and bring you near me so that you may serve me with fear. And again the Holy Spirit said through David (in Ps. 2:11): <small>SERVE THE LORD WITH FEAR</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 3 Genesis, Parashah III: <italic>Lekh-Lekha</italic></title>
<title>3.1 Genesis 12:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 12:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAM: GO</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;Let our masters teach&#x007D; [Let our master instruct us]: What does it mean for one to take upon himself the Kingdom of Heaven (i.e., recite the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> while he is walking?<sup><xref rid="fn237">1</xref></sup> Rav Idi and Rav Huna in the name of R. Jose bar Judah said in the name of R. Samuel:<sup><xref rid="fn238">2</xref></sup> It is forbidden for a person to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven while he is walking. Rather let him stand &#x003C; still &#x003E; upon his feet and give the recitation of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>. Then, when he arrives at &#x201C;Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty forever and ever,&#x201D; let him immediately begin to walk &#x003C; while &#x003E; reciting the <italic>We&#x2019;ahavta</italic> (&#x003D; Deut. 6:5) with no fear (of sinning). You find that whoever is meticulous about the commandments receives much reward. Now Abraham was meticulous about the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn239">3</xref></sup> R. Aha said in the name of R. Alexandri and R. Samuel bar Nahmani in the name of R. Jonathan: They even kept <italic>eruvim</italic> of cooked foods in Abraham&#x2019;s house,<sup><xref rid="fn240">4</xref></sup> as stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE [AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS]</small>. But is there not a single Torah? &#x003C; The plural usage here &#x003E; simply &#x003C; indicates &#x003E; that he was meticulous with all commandments which are in &#x003C; oral and written &#x003E; Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn241">5</xref></sup> The Holy One said: You are meticulous with my commandments; so should you dwell with those who serve idols? Go out from among them. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown? Where they read on the matter] (in Gen. 12:1): <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAM: GO</small>.</p>
<title>3.2 Genesis 12:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 12:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAM: GO</small>.] R. Berekhyah the Priest opened &#x003C; his teaching &#x003E; (with Cant. 8:8): <small>WE HAVE A LITTLE SISTER</small>. How does the text speak about Abraham? In that, when Nimrod cast him into the midst of the fiery furnace,<sup><xref rid="fn242">6</xref></sup> up to that time the Holy One had performed no miracles for him. The ministering angels said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, behold, Nimrod has cast Abraham into the midst of the fiery furnace&#x0021; R. Eliezer haQappar said: <small>WE HAVE A LITTLE SISTER</small>. &#x003C; The passage &#x003E; speaks of one who rends asunder &#x003C; a garment in mourning &#x003E; and does not sew &#x003C; it &#x003E; together Abraham, &#x003C; however &#x003E;, sewed the world together before the Holy One. Since up to then he had no children, for that reason it (Cant. 8:8) called him &#x201C;<small>SISTER</small>.&#x201D; (Cant. 8:8, cont.:) <small>WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR OUR SISTER [IN THE DAY THAT SHE IS SPOKEN FOR]</small>? On the day that Nimrod said to throw him into the midst of the fiery furnace, the Holy One said to the ministering angels (in vs. 9): <small>IF SHE IS A WALL, WE SHALL BUILD UPON HER A SILVER TURRET</small>. [If he gives his life for the sanctification of the name (i.e., in martyrdom), we shall build upon it (his life) a silver turret.] (Vs. 9, cont.:) <small>AND IF SHE IS A DOOR (<italic>DLT</italic>), WE SHALL ENCLOSE HER IN A CEDAR PANEL</small>. If he is too wretched (<italic>DL</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn243">7</xref></sup> to give his life for the sanctification of my name, <small>WE SHALL ENCLOSE (rt.: <italic>TsUR</italic>) HER IN CEDAR PANEL</small>. Just as a picture (rt.: <italic>TsUR</italic>) which is on a panel is easy to erase, so it is easy for him to perish from the world when I am not looking after him. Abraham said (in vs. 10): <small>I AM A WALL</small>. I am giving my life for the sanctification of your name. Straightway he gave his life. How? His father, Terah, was serving idols [and worshiping them]. The Holy One said to him. These are idolaters; yet you are residing among them. (Gen. 12:1:) <small>GO FROM YOUR &#x003C; NATIVE &#x003E; LAND</small>.</p>
<title>3.3 Genesis 12:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): GO. This text is related (to Ps. 45:11 [10]): <small>HEAR, O DAUGHTER, TAKE NOTE, AND INCLINE YOUR EAR: FORGET YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn244">8</xref></sup> <small>HEAR, O DAUGHTER, TAKE NOTE</small>: This refers to Abraham. <small>AND FORGET YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>: This refers to the idolaters, as stated (in Jer. 2:27): <small>THEY SAY TO A TREE: YOU ARE MY FATHER</small>. (Ps. 45:12 [11]) <small>AND THE KING WILL DESIRE YOUR BEAUTY</small>. This refers to the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, &#x003C; who takes pleasure in &#x003E; <sup><xref rid="fn245">9</xref></sup> adorning you in the world. R. Abbin said: &#x007B;(ibid.): <small>BECAUSE HE IS YOUR LORD, BOW DOWN TO HIM</small>.&#x007D; Now what did Abraham resemble?<sup><xref rid="fn246">10</xref></sup> A vial of persimmon<sup><xref rid="fn247">11</xref></sup> when it has been set in a graveyard. Then no one would know what its aroma was. What did a certain one do? He took it and moved it from place to place, &#x003C; so that &#x003E; its aroma began to disperse abroad. Similarly Abraham was dwelling among those who served idols. The Holy One said to him: Why are you residing among the wicked? Go out from among them, and make your good works known abroad. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>.</p>
<title>3.4 Genesis 12:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>. R. Levi said: What is the meaning of <small>GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>)</small>? The Holy One said to him: At age one hundred you will produce a son. It is so stated &#x003C; in the words &#x003E; <small><italic>LK LK</italic></small>: <italic>L</italic> &#x003D; thirty; <italic>K</italic> &#x003D; twenty. &#x003C; <italic>LK</italic> appears &#x003E; two times, <italic>LK LK</italic>. Ergo, one hundred.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>)</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: Throw away your (<italic>LK</italic>) life in this world, but in the world to come your reward is prepared for you (<italic>LK</italic>).</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>GO</small>. R. Levi ben Hama [said]: The Holy One said to him: For &#x003C; your &#x003E; first testing and &#x003C; your &#x003E; last testing I am only testing you with <small>GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn248">12</xref></sup> (Thus Gen. 12:1 reads:) <small>GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>) FROM YOUR &#x003C; NATIVE &#x003E; LAND</small>; (and Gen. 22:2 reads): <small>&#x003C; PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON &#x003E; &#x2026; AND GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>) TO THE LAND OF MORIAH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO (<italic>LK LK</italic>)</small>. The Holy One said to him: I sought (rt.: <italic>ShHR</italic>) you <small>(<italic>LK</italic>)</small> early. Thus R. Joshua ben Qorhah said: David said (in Ps. 110:3): <small>YOUR PEOPLE (<italic>&#x2018;MK</italic>) OFFER THEMSELVES WILLINGLY IN THE DAY OF YOUR WARFARE (rt.: <italic>HYL</italic>)&#x2026; &#x003C; FROM THE WOMB OF THE DAWN (rt.: <italic>SHHR</italic>). &#x003E; YOURS (<italic>LK</italic>) IS THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn249">13</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: I was with you (<italic>&#x2018;MK</italic>) on the day that you armed your forces (rt.: <italic>HYL</italic>). What is the meaning of <small>THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH</small>? R. Aha said: R. Hanina said: At the age of three years Abraham recognized his Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn250">14</xref></sup> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE (&#x2018;<italic>QB</italic>) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE</small>. By gematria<sup><xref rid="fn251">15</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>QB</italic> &#x003D; 172 &#x003C; years &#x003E;, and all the days of Abraham are 175 &#x003C; years &#x003E;. Hence<sup><xref rid="fn252">16</xref></sup> you learn that at the age of three years Abraham knew his Creator. The Holy One said to him: I am making all the evil deeds which you did in those three years like this dew. Ergo (in Ps. 110:3): <small>THE DEW OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>. For your sake I created the world. R. Tahalifa said: The Holy One said: I looked at you when I created the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH WHEN THEY WERE CREATED</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHEN THEY WERE CREATED (<italic>BHBR&#x2019;M</italic>)</small>? In Abraham (<italic>B&#x2018;BRHM</italic>) he created them.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. &#x003C; Here is &#x003E; a testing within a testing, since he did not tell him which place to go to. &#x003C; He &#x003E; merely &#x003C; said &#x003E;: <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:1): <small>GO &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said: [This text is related (to Ps. 32:8): <small>LET ME INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU IN THE WAY IN WHICH YOU SHALL GO</small>.] So shall I instruct you. What is the meaning of <small>LET ME INSTRUCT (<italic>askil</italic>) YOU</small>? Let me place wisdom within you, as stated (in Josh. 1:7): <small>SO THAT YOU MAY BE SUCCESSFUL (<italic>taskil</italic>)</small>. (Ps. 32:8:) <small>AND TEACH YOU (&#x2019;<italic>WR</italic>)</small>, in the sense that I am enlightening (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>WR</italic>) your eyes.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 32:8): <small>AND TEACH YOU</small>. &#x003C; The words mean &#x003E; that I am guiding you onto a good way. (Ps. 32:8, end:) <small>IN THE WAY IN WHICH YOU SHALL GO, LET ME GIVE COUNSEL WITH MY EYES UPON YOU</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 32:8): <small>LET ME INSTRUCT YOU AND TEACH YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND TEACH YOU? &#x003C; AND TEACH YOU THE WAY TO GO &#x003E;</small>, (according to Gen. 12:1) <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. He said to Abraham: You are not losing out. <small>FOR</small> (according to vs. 2) <small>I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn253">17</xref></sup> &#x201C;For I will establish you&#x201D; is not written here but <small>FOR I WILL MAKE YOU</small>, because I creating you as a new creature. In the same sense it is stated (in Gen. 1:7): <small>AND GOD MADE THE FIRMAMENT</small>. &#x003C; Similarly &#x003E; (in vs. 16): <small>AND GOD MADE THE TWO &#x003C; GREAT &#x003E; LIGHTS</small>. R. &#x007B;Minhas&#x007D; [Pinhas] bar Hama [the Priest] said: When did the Holy One make Abraham a great nation? When Israel had left Egypt, come to Sinai, and received the Torah, Moses looked at them and said: Behold, they have been made just as the Holy One had promised to the patriarch. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:8): <small>AND WHAT GREAT NATION</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.5 Genesis 12:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>FOR I WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT NATION</small>. What is the greatness of your children? &#x003C; It lies &#x003E; in the Torah, as stated (in Deut. 4:6) <small>SURELY &#x003C; THIS GREAT NATION &#x003E; IS A WISE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE</small>. (Gen. 12:2, cont.:) <small>I WILL BLESS YOU</small> when I bless you with my glory.<sup><xref rid="fn254">18</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND MAGNIFY YOUR NAME</small> so that your name is magnified throughout the world. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>? Your blessing shall precede my blessing, since (in the Eighteen Benedictions of the liturgy) they say: <small>THE SHIELD OF ABRAHAM</small> (in the first benediction), and afterwards <small>WHO REVIVES THE DEAD</small> (in the second one, which is called God&#x2019;s Benediction).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn255">19</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: From the time that I created my world until now I have been obliged to bless my people. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM</small>. So I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>AND GOD BLESSED NOAH &#x003C; AND HIS CHILDREN &#x003E;</small>. From now on you are responsible for the blessing. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. But he did not act, except &#x003C; that &#x003E;, when Isaac arose, Abraham wanted to bless him. &#x003C; Still &#x003E;, when he foresaw that Esau and Jacob would issue from him, he did not bless him. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king of flesh and blood who had an orchard.<sup><xref rid="fn256">20</xref></sup> So he gave it to a tenant so that he would tend it. Now within the orchard were a tree with the elixir of death and a tree with the elixir of life. &#x003C; The two &#x003E; were clinging to each other. The tenant said: What shall I do? I cannot water one and leave the other alone. Instead I shall leave them alone until the owner of the orchard comes. Then he will know what to do. Similarly Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Jacob and Esau will issue from him. Instead I shall leave him alone until the Holy One is willing to bless him. As soon as Abraham and Isaac had passed away, the Holy One blessed Jacob by himself, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB&#x2026; [AND BLESSED HIM].</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 12:2): <small>SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. The Holy One said to him: I am going to raise up a tribe from you so that it may bless Israel. And which one is this? The tribe of Levi, since that &#x003C; is the one which &#x003E; blesses Israel. Abraham said to him: Sovereign of the World, who is to bless that tribe? The Holy One said to him: When they bless Israel, I will bless them. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 6:27): <small>THUS THEY SHALL SET MY NAME UPON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND I WILL BLESS THEM</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world the tribe of Levi is blessing you in my name, but in the world to come I will bless you in my glory. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 31:22 [23]): <small>MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU, O HABITATION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, O HOLY MOUNTAIN</small>.</p>
<title>3.6 Genesis 14:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 14:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. Let our master instruct us: In regard to a proselyte who converts on the eve of Passover, how does he eat his paschal offering? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Pes.</italic> 8:8)<sup><xref rid="fn257">21</xref></sup> <small>THE BET SHAMMAY SAY: HE IMMERSES AND EATS HIS PASCHAL OFFERING ON THE EVE, BUT THE BET HILLEL SAY: ONE WHO TURNS ASIDE FROM A STATE OF UNCIRCUMCISION IS AS ONE WHO TURNS ASIDE FROM THE GRAVE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn258">22</xref></sup> Resh Laqish said: The proselyte who converts is more beloved than Israel when they stood at Mount Sinai. Why? Because, if they had not seen the thunder and lightning, the mountains trembling, and the noise of the trumpets, they would not have accepted the Torah. But this &#x003C; proselyte &#x003E;, who did not see one of them, came, resigned himself to the Holy One, and took upon himself the Kingdom of Heaven. Is there one of you more lovable than this one? Once upon a time Onqelos the Proselyte questioned a certain elder and said to him: How the Holy One loves the proselyte when he has stated (in Deut. 10:18 that one should) <small>LOVE &#x007B;THE&#x007D; [a] PROSELYTE IN GIVING HIM FOOD AND CLOTHING</small>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn259">23</xref></sup> Is that everything? <small>FOOD AND CLOTHING</small>? He said to him: But did not our father Jacob seek only this? Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:20): <small>AND &#x003C; IF GOD &#x003E; GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. Our masters have said: The proselyte is beloved because the Holy One had &#x003C; the following &#x003E; written about himself (in Jer. 14:8): <small>WHY ARE YOU LIKE A PROSELYTE IN THE LAND</small>? The Holy One said: Thus do I love the proselyte. Moreover, Abraham is the father of proselytes,<sup><xref rid="fn260">24</xref></sup> and these wicked ones have come to join &#x003C; in battle &#x003E; against him. Woe to them, for their end is to fall (<italic>PL</italic>) before him. Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL (&#x2019;<italic>MRPL</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn261">25</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.7 Genesis 14:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 14:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>.] Thus did R. Tanhuma bar Abba begin: (Ps. 37:14-15:) <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN A SWORD &#x2026; &#x003C; TO BRING DOWN THE POOR AND NEEDY &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR HEART</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn262">26</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) A SWORD</small>? This refers to Cain, for until then no murderer had existed in the world. But Cain came and began (<italic>PTH</italic>) murder, as stated (in Gen. 4:8): <small>CAIN AROSE [AGAINST HIS BROTHER ABEL AND MURDERED HIM]</small>. The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, you have started using (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) the sword in the world. (Ps. 37:14:) <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) A SWORD</small>. This refers to Cain. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO BRING DOWN THE POOR AND NEEDY, &#x003C; TO SLAY THOSE WHO WAY IS UPRIGHT &#x003E;</small>. This refers to Abel. The Holy One said to him (i.e., Cain): You have let loose (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) a sword in the world. The sword shall enter the heart of that same person. (Ps. 37:15:) <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:14-15): <small>THE WICKED HAVE DRAWN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) A SWORD</small>. This refers to Hanun ben Nahash. When his father died, David sent him his condolences. What did Hanun do? He took David&#x2019;s servants and made <italic>paradeigmata</italic><sup><xref rid="fn263">27</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a mockery&#x007D; of them, as stated (in II Sam. 10:4): <small>SO [HANUN] TOOK DAVID&#x2019;S SERVANTS, [SHAVED OFF ONE SIDE OF THEIR BEARDS, CUT THEIR GARMENTS IN HALF] &#x003C; AT THEIR BUTTOCKS &#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C; Hanun &#x003E; immediately sent to Aram-maharam and hired thirty-two thousand chariots in addition to as many troops<sup><xref rid="fn264">28</xref></sup> as he had.<sup><xref rid="fn265">29</xref></sup> (I Chron. 19:7): <small>THEN THEY CAME AND ENCAMPED AT MEDEBA</small>. The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, you have started using (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) the sword. A sword shall enter the heart of that same person, as stated (in Ps. 37:15): <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>. Immediately Joab and Abishai arose and killed all the troops, as stated (in II Sam. 10:13): <small>THEN JOAB &#x003C; AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM &#x003E; WENT &#x003C; INTO BATTLE AGAINST THE ARAMEANS &#x003E;&#x2026;.</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:15): <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>. These were the four kings, Amraphel and his allies, for until then there had been no war in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn266">30</xref></sup> Then they came and started using (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) the sword, as stated (in Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small> that they began to make war. The Holy One said to them: O wicked ones, you have started using the sword. The sword shall enter the heart of those same people, as stated (in Ps. 37:15): <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>. Immediately Abraham rose up against them and killed them, as stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &#x003C; HIS FORCES &#x003E; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.</p>
<title>3.8 Genesis 14:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>What is written above concerning the matter (in Gen. 12:1): <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM: GO &#x003C; FROM YOUR NATIVE LAND &#x003E; &#x2026; UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. &#x201C;Unto such and such a land&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW YOU</small>. So Abraham was on the move until he came to the land of Israel. May the name of the Holy One be blessed&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn267">31</xref></sup> He desired to test the righteous one and to make his good works known. For his sake there immediately came a famine. When he encountered the famine, he said to his wife, Sarah: See, there is a famine here. Our masters have said: There was never a famine in the world more severe than &#x003C; that &#x003E; one. Abraham said to Sarah: Consider Egypt. It would be nice to settle there inasmuch as famine has come. The supply is available there, and meat is plentiful. Let us go there. At that time they went down to Egypt. When they arrived at the gate<sup><xref rid="fn268">32</xref></sup> of Egypt, Abraham said to Sarah: My girl<sup><xref rid="fn269">33</xref></sup> Egypt is a place of whoredom, as stated (in Ezek. 23:19-20): &#x2026; <small>&#x003C; SHE WAS A WHORE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, AND SHE LUSTED OVER THEIR PARAMOURS &#x003E; WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>. Let us, however, put you in a box and lock you in it. Then he did so. When they arrived at the gate of Egypt, the customs officers said to him: What are you carrying in the box? He said to them: Beans. They said to him: No, it is pepper. Give us the duty for pepper. He said to them: I shall hand it over. They said to him: It is not that. Rather this box is full of gold coins. He said to them: I shall hand you over the duty for gold coins. When they saw that he was accepting whatever they would say about it, they said: Unless he had something of value in his possession, we &#x003C; could &#x003E; not be raising the price for him. At that moment they said to him: You are not moving from here until you open the box. Then he said to them: It is up to me to give you whatever you want, but you are not to open the box. Nevertheless, they insisted on opening the box against his will and saw Sarah. When they saw her, they said: In the case of one like this, it is not seemly to touch her. Immediately they took &#x003C; her &#x003E; and brought her to Pharaoh. So they brought her into his palace<sup><xref rid="fn270">34</xref></sup> When Abraham saw that they had taken her and brought her unto Pharaoh, Abraham began to cry. &#x003C; Sarah &#x003E; also said: Sovereign of the World, Abraham came with you under a promise,<sup><xref rid="fn271">35</xref></sup> since you had said to him (in Gen 12:3): <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>. Now I did not know anything except that, when he told me that you had said to him (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO</small>, I believed your words. But now, &#x003C; when &#x003E; I have been left isolated from my father, my mother, and my husband, this wicked man has come to mistreat me. He (Abraham) had acted because of your great name and because of our trust in your words. The Holy One said to her: By your life, nothing evil shall harm you, as stated (in Prov. 12:21): <small>NO HARM SHALL BEFALL THE RIGHTEOUS, BUT THE WICKED ARE FULL OF EVIL</small>. So in regard to Pharaoh and his house, I will make an example<sup><xref rid="fn272">36</xref></sup> of them. Thus it is written (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH AND HIS HOUSE WITH GREAT PLAGUES AT THE WORD OF SARAI</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn273">37</xref></sup> In that very hour an angel came down from the heavens with a rod in his hand. &#x003C; When &#x003E; Pharaoh came to take off her shoe, he smote him with his hand. &#x003C; When &#x003E; he came to touch her clothes, he would smite him. And the angel would consult with Sarah on each and every blow. If she said that he should be afflicted, he was afflicted. When she would say: Wait for him until he recovers himself, the angel would wait for him, as stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>AT THE WORD OF SARAI</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AT THE WORD OF SARAI</small>? That &#x003C; here &#x003E; is not stated &#x201C;On the matter of,&#x201D; nor &#x201C;over the cause of,&#x201D; nor &#x201C;for the sake of,&#x201D; nor &#x201C;in consequence of,&#x201D; but <small>AT THE WORD OF SARAI</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn274">38</xref></sup> Thus, if she said that he should be afflicted, he was afflicted; and, if not, he was not afflicted. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The Holy One did not allow a wicked man to occupy himself with a righteous woman. Our masters have said: &#x003C; When &#x003E; he came to take off her shoe, leprosy immediately came over him,<sup><xref rid="fn275">39</xref></sup> and his governors<sup><xref rid="fn276">40</xref></sup> were also afflicted with him&#x2014;also the princes, also the servants, and also his family. And the walls also were afflicted along with him,<sup><xref rid="fn277">41</xref></sup> as stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH AND HIS HOUSE</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AT THE WORD OF SARAI, ABRAM&#x2019;S WIFE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.9 Genesis 14:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>It is written (in Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL BLOSSOM LIKE THE DATE PALM, &#x003C; AND GROW LIKE A CEDAR OF LEBANON &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn278">42</xref></sup> R. Tanhuma began: Why are the righteous likened to a date palm and cedar, but not to another tree? You find that &#x003C; of &#x003E; all the trees, there is none &#x003C; about which &#x003E; one can say at a distance: This such-and-such a tree. Why? Because they are short. But the date palm and the cedar, because they are tall in stature, are seen at a distance. So the righteous are seen at a distance.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why are the righteous likened to a date palm and a cedar? Because you find that with most trees, even though they are chopped down, if one takes shoots from them and plants them in another place (i.e., to replace the lost trees), they will immediately grow. However, when the date palm and the cedar are chopped down, who can make others grow in their stead, except with a lot of years and with great toil? Thus, if a righteous person is lost from the world, who can raise up another in his stead, except after several years?</p>
<title>3.10 Genesis 14:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>There is a story about R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,<sup><xref rid="fn279">43</xref></sup> who was a child of the palace.<sup><xref rid="fn280">44</xref></sup> Now his father was connected with the government and with matters of the army commander.<sup><xref rid="fn281">45</xref></sup> One day R. Eliezer&#x2019;s father went to another place. When he had realized that they<sup><xref rid="fn282">46</xref></sup> were coming, he had said to his children: Let us rise and flee from them. He immediately called his servants and attendants. He said: Bring me the cattle and the camels. They loaded the vessels upon the cattle. Then Hyrcanus and his sons fled. R. Eliezer, however, did not go with his father. Instead, he fled to Jerusalem. Moreover, he took with him no loaf of bread, no money, nothing at all. Rather he entered Jerusalem as a pauper. Then he saw Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay sitting and teaching Torah, with his students sitting before him &#x003C; as they studied &#x003E; the chapter. When they had finished the chapter, he told them <italic>haggadah</italic>. Then afterwards he would tell them a <italic>mishnah</italic>. He (Eliezer) entered and sat by Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay. He spent two or three weeks before him; but when he came to speak to the &#x003C; regular &#x003E; students, they smelled a foul odor from his mouth. So they hid and said nothing. Again he came to speak, but they hid and said nothing. Again he came to speak, and &#x003C; again &#x003E; they hid and said nothing. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay knew that his mouth odor was not from something bad which he had in his mouth, but from hunger, since he had not been eating anything. Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay said to those students: By your lives, you should look into the thing so as to know what is the matter with this student, whether he is hungry and what he is eating. So they went around through all Jerusalem and asked innkeepers:<sup><xref rid="fn283">47</xref></sup> Is there a <italic>haver</italic> lodging<sup><xref rid="fn284">48</xref></sup> here? They said to them: No. They came to a certain woman. They asked her: Is there a <italic>haver</italic> lodging here? She said to them: Yes. Does he have anything in here? She said to them: He has a single sack. They said to her: Show it to us. She immediately brought it to them. They opened it and found dirt in it, for he would put his head in it and suck as on a wine bag. They went and told Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, who was astonished over the matter. Then he saw &#x003C; that there was &#x003E; righteousness with R. Eliezer in that he had not sought out someone at once and said: Give me something. In that very hour he designated a great deal of money for him, so that he would eat good food like that to which he had been accustomed in his father&#x2019;s house. So he ate and drank well until the odor from his mouth was cured. He spent a year before Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, then two, then three years, until R. Eliezer&#x2019;s father returned to his place. When he had returned to his place, he remained there a month, then two months; but his son, R. Eliezer, did not come. He became angry and said: I left him, and he went to Jerusalem. &#x007B;R. Eliezer&#x2019;s daughter also said to her father:&#x007D; [R. Eliezer&#x2019;s brothers also said to their father:] Look at your son, Eliezer&#x0021; What has he done? He has forsaken you and gone to Jerusalem to eat fattened &#x003C; meats &#x003E;, while you have moved away from your home and gone after him.<sup><xref rid="fn285">49</xref></sup> If something bad (i.e., your death) had happened, would he not have jumped to obtain an inheritance? How great a difference there is between us and your son&#x0021; We have given our lives for you and did not forsake you, but he did not come to see you in your trouble. Yet now, if he hears that something has happened to you, he is going to come unto us and share &#x003C; the inheritance &#x003E; with us. In that very hour he said to them: By thus and so, he is not inheriting anything from me. They said to him: Before you die, should you &#x003C; not &#x003E; disinherit him? He said to them: Summon me a tablet.<sup><xref rid="fn286">50</xref></sup> They said: It will not be of any use. There is a certain <italic>nasi</italic> in Jerusalem whose name is Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay, &#x007B;he has helped me.&#x007D; [and he is helping him.] After you die, he will surely come and say: Who will say that his father disinherited him? Then we shall bring out the document, but he will say: It is a <italic>plaston</italic><sup><xref rid="fn287">51</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a forgery&#x007D;. You made it, and I will not believe it until we go to court. He said to them: Inasmuch as you have told me this, &#x003C; even though &#x003E; Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay is praising him, I am disinheriting him. In that hour his sons mounted him in a <italic>basterna</italic><sup><xref rid="fn288">52</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a carriage&#x007D;, and he entered Jerusalem on the eve of the Sabbath. He said: I am not disinheriting him &#x003C; anywhere &#x003E; but [on the Sabbath] in the academy. When? When the whole congregation will be assembling. He went in to sit down in the academy, and all Israel entered according to their custom to hear the sermon that R. Eliezer was preaching in public &#x003C; from &#x003E; upon the seat of honor, with the <italic>hazzan</italic> standing before him. His father saw him wrapped in his <italic>tallit</italic> with <italic>tefillin</italic> on his head.<sup><xref rid="fn289">53</xref></sup> He immediately saw the one whom he thought had departed for bad ways. When he saw him sitting upon the throne and preaching, Hyrcanus stood upon the bench<sup><xref rid="fn290">54</xref></sup> and said before the people of Jerusalem: I only went up to Jerusalem to cast you out, Eliezer my son, and also to remove you from your inheritance. Now behold, I am giving you two portions more than your brothers. And on what subject was R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus preaching at that time? Our masters have said: On this subject (in Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus began: This text is related (to Ps. 37:15): <small>THEIR SWORD SHALL ENTER THEIR OWN HEART</small>. This whole subject is what there is at the beginning of the <italic>parashah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn291">55</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.11 Genesis 14:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 14:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 44:6 [5]): <small>THROUGH YOU SHALL WE PUSH DOWN OUR ADVERSARIES. THROUGH YOU</small> means &#x201C;through your Law.&#x201D; [R. Isaac said:] <small>THROUGH YOU (<italic>BK</italic>)</small> &#x003C; is to be interpreted &#x003E; by gematria:<sup><xref rid="fn292">56</xref></sup> <italic>B</italic> &#x003D; two; <italic>K</italic> &#x003D; twenty. Ergo: twenty-two. &#x003C; Thus, <small>THROUGH YOU</small> means &#x003E; &#x201C;through the twenty-two letters which are in the Law. (Ps. 44:6 [5], cont.:) <small>&#x007B;IN YOUR NAME SHALL YOU RAISE UP OUR BRIGHTNESS.&#x007D; [AND IN YOUR NAME WE SHALL TRAMPLE DOWN THOSE WHO ARISE AGAINST US.]</small> Abraham said: Sovereign of the World, If you had not united your glory with me and helped me, what could &#x003C; I as &#x003E; a single person have done against nine kings (of Gen. 14:9) and their forces? However, because you helped me they fell at my hand. What is written (in Gen. 14:15)? <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn293">57</xref></sup> Masters say: The night divided of its own accord. R. Benjamin ben Jafeth said in the name of R. Johanan: The Holy One, the one who knows his moments and his instants, he divided it.<sup><xref rid="fn294">58</xref></sup> The Holy One said: You have worked with me from yesterday evening until midnight and killed my enemies. By your life, I am working with your children from midnight until the morning and killing their enemies. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. Therefore it is stated (in Gen. 14:1, 15): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE DAYS OF AMRAPHEL &#x2026; &#x003C; AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>3.12 Genesis 14:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: The Holy One transmitted a sign<sup><xref rid="fn295">59</xref></sup> to Abraham that whatever had happened to him would happen to his children.<sup><xref rid="fn296">60</xref></sup> Abraham was chosen from the whole household of his father. Israel also was chosen from seventy tongues. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO &#x2026; &#x003C; FROM YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE &#x003E;</small>; and it was said for Israel (in Exod. 3:17): <small>AND I HAVE SAID: I WILL BRING YOU UP &#x003C; OUT OF THE AFFLICTION OF THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003E;</small>. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:3): <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>; and also for Israel (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. It was said to Abraham (in Gen. 12:2): <small>[THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION, BLESS YOU], AND MAKE YOUR NAME GREAT</small>; and also concerning Israel (in Deut. 4:8): <small>AND WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE &#x003C; WHICH HAS STATUTES AND ORDINANCES AS RIGHTEOUS AS ALL THIS LAW THAT I SET BEFORE YOU THIS DAY &#x003E;</small>? Abraham was called an individual, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE (<italic>ehad</italic>)</small>; and also Israel (in I Chron. 17:21): <small>AND WHO IS LIKE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, A UNIQUE (<italic>ehad</italic>) NATION ON EARTH</small>? Just as with Abraham, when he came to the land, there was a famine in the land; with Israel also, when they had settled in the land of Israel, there was famine, as stated (in Gen. 43:1): <small>BUT THE FAMINE WAS SEVERE IN THE LAND</small>. Just as Abraham went down to Egypt because of famine, [as stated (in Gen. 12:10): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND, AND ABRAM WENT DOWN TO EGYPT]</small>; so with Israel, as stated (in Gen. 42:3): <small>SO THE TEN BROTHERS OF JOSEPH WENT DOWN TO BUY GRAIN &#x003C; FROM EGYPT &#x003E;</small>. Just as in the case of Abraham, when he went down to Egypt, the Egyptians provoked him; so in the case of Israel, as stated (in Exod. 1:10): <small>COME, LET US (Egyptians) ACT SHREWDLY &#x003C; TOWARD THEM (Israel), LEST THEY MULTIPLY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Just as in the case of Abraham, four kings engaged him in battle;<sup><xref rid="fn297">61</xref></sup> so in the case of Israel, the nations are going to make an alliance<sup><xref rid="fn298">62</xref></sup> against them, as stated (in Ps. 2:2): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TAKE THEIR STAND, &#x003C; AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED &#x003E;</small>. Just as in the case of Abraham, the Holy One went out to fight before him and slew his enemies; so the Holy One has fought for Israel. In the age to come the Holy One is going out to fight their wars, as stated (in Zech. 14:3): <small>THEN THE LORD WILL COME FORTH AND FIGHT WITH THOSE NATIONS AS WHEN HE FIGHTS IN THE DAY OF BATTLE</small>.</p>
<title>3.13 Genesis 15:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 15:1:) <small>AFTER THESE THINGS THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO ABRAHAM</small>. Let our master instruct us: For what reason was the burnt offering brought?<sup><xref rid="fn299">63</xref></sup> R. Ishmael says: Because of positive and negative commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn300">64</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Johay says: On account of &#x003C; evil &#x003E; thoughts in the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn301">65</xref></sup> as stated (in Job 1:5): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN THE DAYS OF THE FEAST HAD COME TO AN END, JOB WOULD SEND AND SANCTIFY THEM &#x2026; &#x003C; AND WOULD OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS &#x2026; FOR JOB SAID: PERHAPS MY SONS HAVE SINNED AND BLASPHEMED GOD IN THEIR HEARTS &#x003E;</small>. You find that Abraham would reflect on the quality of &#x003C; Divine &#x003E; justice. What would he say? R. Levi said: It seems to me that I have received my reward in this world when the Holy One helped me with the kings and delivered me from the fiery furnace (of Nimrod). The Holy One said to him: Since you have reflected on me, you must bring a sacrifice, as stated (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON &#x2026; &#x003C; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING &#x003E;</small>. R. Isaac said: He was saying this: My heart is uttering gall and wormwood. Perhaps among these whom I have killed there were righteous ones.<sup><xref rid="fn302">66</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Have no fear of this. They were thorns; and for them you have, not a punishment, but a reward. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:1, end): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM&#x0021; I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU; &#x007B;ALSO&#x007D; YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>.</p>
<title>3.14 Genesis 15:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 15:1): <small>AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn303">67</xref></sup> [What is the meaning of <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT</small>?] Before the world was created, the Holy One reserved the Law for Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &#x003C; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; This &#x003E; teaches that Abraham kept all the commandments and all the Torahs. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Jonathan said: Our father Abraham also maintained the <italic>&#x2018;eruvim</italic> of cooked foods.<sup><xref rid="fn304">68</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE</small>. For that reason, Solomon stated (in Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT, [A SHIELD FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BLAMELESSLY]</small>. The Holy One said to Abraham: You have been occupied with my Law. By your life, I am a shield for you, as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM&#x0021; [I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU]</small>. Just as, when one grasps the shield, even if darts and stones are thrown at him, he is not afraid; [so I am doing for you], as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU; YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>&#x2014;not for you alone, but also for your children, if they are occupied with my Law just as you have been occupied. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 30:5): <small>[EVERY] UTTERANCE OF GOD IS PURE, A SHIELD FOR &#x007B;ALL&#x007D; WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 2:7): <small>HE RESERVES UNDERSTANDING FOR THE UPRIGHT, [A SHIELD FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BLAMELESSLY]</small>.</p>
<title>3.15 Genesis 15:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 15:1:) <small>AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 11:18): <small>A WICKED ONE DOES THE WORK OF FALSEHOOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn305">69</xref></sup> This refers to Nimrod the Wicked, who used to make images and lead astray the children of Adam; for idolatry resembles falsehood, as stated (in Jer. 10:14): <small>FOR HIS MOLTEN IMAGE IS FALSEHOOD AND THERE IS NO BREATH IN THEM</small>. (Prov. 11:18, cont.:) <small>THE ONE WHO SOWS RIGHTEOUSNESS HAS A TRUE REWARD</small>. This refers to our father Abraham, who did sow righteousness when he would serve food to those who passed back and forth,<sup><xref rid="fn306">70</xref></sup> as stated (in Gen. 21:33): <small>THEN HE PLANTED AN INN</small><sup><xref rid="fn307">71</xref></sup> <small>IN BEERSHEBA</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life you have a true reward, as stated (in Gen. 15:1, end): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM&#x0021;&#x2026; [YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT]</small>.</p>
<title>3.16 Genesis 15:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 14:14)?<sup><xref rid="fn308">72</xref></sup> <small>WHEN ABRAM HEARD THAT HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN CAPTURED</small>. Was he Lot&#x2019;s brother? Look, however, at the humility of our father Abraham after all the strife they had had with him, [as stated (in Gen. 13:7): <small>NOW THERE WAS QUARRELING BETWEEN THE HERDSMEN OF ABRAM&#x2019;S CATTLE AND THE HERDSMEN OF LOT&#x2019;S CATTLE</small>.] Our father Abraham did not remember the strife but called him his brother, as stated (in Gen. 13:8): <small>FOR WE ARE BROTHERS</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 14:14, cont.:) <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN</small>? That he took silver and gold and covered them with it.<sup><xref rid="fn309">73</xref></sup> He said to them: You know that we are going off to war and that we are going in order to save lives. Do not set your eyes on wealth. If &#x003C; you are going &#x003E; for the sake of silver and gold, here it is before you, as stated (ibid.): <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN. HE ARMED (<italic>YRQ</italic>)</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; nothing but that he covered them with silver and gold, as stated (in Ps. 68:14 [13]): <small>THE WINGS OF A DOVE ARE COVERED WITH SILVER AND ITS PINIONS WITH THE YELLOW (<italic>YRQRQ</italic>) OF GOLD</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 14:14): <small>HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN. HE ARMED (<italic>yareq</italic>)</small> means nothing but that he made them turn pale (<italic>horiq</italic>) with words, just as it is written in the Law (in Deut. 20:8): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO IS AFRAID (<italic>yare</italic>) AND FAINT (<italic>rakh</italic>) OF HEART</small>. Abraham did this: He said to them: We are going off to war. Let anyone who has transgressions on his hand and is afraid because of his actions not go off with us. When they heard that, anyone who knew in his heart that he had sinned was afraid and did not go off. So they went back, and no one was left with him (Abraham) but Eliezer alone.<sup><xref rid="fn310">74</xref></sup> In that hour the Holy One said: All have forsaken you, and no one is left except Eliezer alone. By your life I am putting within him the power of three hundred and eighteen.<sup><xref rid="fn311">75</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:14) <small>AND HE ARMED HIS TRAINED MEN, THE ONES BORN IN HIS HOUSE, THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN &#x003C; OF THEM &#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown? The numerical value of Eliezer by gematria is three hundred and eighteen.</p>
<title>3.17 Genesis 15:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 14:14, end:) <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS DAN</small>. Our masters have said: What was his reason for him to go in pursuit as far as Dan?<sup><xref rid="fn312">76</xref></sup> Two things smite &#x003C; people &#x003E; before and behind. These are idolatry and one who plants on the eve of the Sabbath Year and in the period just after the Sabbath Year. Just as one who plants on the eve of the Sabbath Year and on the periods just after the Sabbath year is culpable, so idolatry smites one beforehand and afterward. Now up to then Jeroboam ben Nebat had not arisen to practice idolatry, &#x003C; but &#x003E; Abraham saw it, as stated (in I Kings 12:29): <small>THEN &#x003C; JEROBOAM &#x003E; SET UP ONE &#x003C; IDOL &#x003E; IN BETHEL AND [PLACED] THE OTHER IN DAN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn313">77</xref></sup> So, when Abraham arrived as far as that place, his strength failed him and he did not go on in pursuit, as stated (in Gen. 14:14): <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS DAN</small>. Thus he judged (<italic>dan</italic>) them and found them guilty (rt.: <italic>HWB</italic>), as stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>AND HE WENT IN PURSUIT AS FAR AS HOBAH (<italic>HWBH</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn314">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 14:14:) <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn315">79</xref></sup> Because of the Holy One the night was divided with Abraham, as stated: <small>AND &#x003C; THE NIGHT &#x003E; WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn316">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 14:16:) <small>THEN HE RETURNED ALL THE PROPERTY</small>. &#x003C; There &#x003E; immediately &#x003C; follows &#x003E; (in vs. 17): <small>AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT</small>. When he saw Abraham pursuing the sixteen kings and their legions,<sup><xref rid="fn317">81</xref></sup> the Holy One set him on the right, as stated (in Ps. 110:1): <small>THE LORD SAYS TO MY LORD, SIT ON MY RIGHT &#x003C; UNTIL I MAKE YOUR ENEMIES YOUR FOOTSTOOL &#x003E;</small>. They<sup><xref rid="fn318">82</xref></sup> said: In this war the pace of our father Abraham was four miles<sup><xref rid="fn319">83</xref></sup> long; and he ran until, having killed all the kings and their legions, he traveled on in peace. Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:3): <small>HE PURSUES THEM AND TRAVELS ON IN PEACE</small>&#x2026;. Immediately the king of Sodom came out to meet him, as stated (in Gen. 14:17): <small>AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT TO MEET HIM</small>. He said to him: If you please, (according to Gen. 14:21): <small>GIVE ME THE PEOPLE AND TAKE THE PROPERTY FOR YOURSELF</small>. Wanting &#x003C; the former &#x003E; and not wanting &#x003C; the latter &#x003E;, he said to him: If they had killed me, they would have taken all my assets. Now that you have rescued me, receive the property for yourself, and <small>GIVE ME THE PEOPLE</small>. So it is therefore stated: <small>AND TAKE THE PROPERTY FOR YOURSELF</small>. Abraham immediately took an oath, as stated (in vs. 22): <small>THEN ABRAM SAID UNTO THE KING OF SODOM: I HAVE LIFTED UP MY HAND &#x003C; UNTO THE LORD, GOD MOST HIGH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; Such a &#x003E; lifting up is nothing but an oath, as stated (in Dan. 12:7): <small>WHEN HE LIFTED UP HIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS LEFT HAND UNTO HEAVEN AND SWORE BY THE ONE WHO LIVES FOREVER</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 14:23:) <small>THAT &#x003C; I WILL TAKE NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP &#x003C; FROM ANYTHING THAT IS YOURS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Why? Because the Holy One has promised me that he will make me rich, as stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>I WILL MAGNIFY YOUR NAME</small>. Now should I receive from what belongs to you, so that you might say (ibid., cont.): <small>I HAVE MADE YOU RICH</small>? The Holy One said: You have said: <small>&#x003C; NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. By your life I am giving your children an altar around which <small>A THREAD OF RED PAINT</small> encompasses, just as our masters have taught (in <italic>Mid</italic>. 3:1).</p>
<p>Another interpretation: I am giving your children a commandment concerning thread, as stated (in Numb. 15:38): <small>THAT THEY MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES &#x2026; &#x003C; AND PUT ON THE TASSEL OF EACH CORNER A THREAD OF BLUE &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn320">84</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. The Holy One said: I am giving your children the commandment of the sandal, as stated (in Deut. 25:9): <small>THEN SHE SHALL TAKE OFF HIS SANDAL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn321">85</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. The Holy One said: By virtue of this I am giving your children the commandment of Passover, as stated (in Exod. 12:11): <small>AND THUS SHALL YOU EAT IT: WITH YOUR LOINS GIRDED, YOUR SANDALS &#x003C; ON YOUR FEET &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: You have stated (in Gen. 14:23): <small>&#x003C; NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. I am exalting your children, as stated (in Cant. 7:2 [1]): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR FEET IN SANDALS</small>. Another interpretation: <small>&#x003C; NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. I am exalting your children with a thread, as stated (in Cant. 4:3): <small>[YOUR LIPS ARE] LIKE A SCARLET THREAD</small>. Another interpretation: You have stated: <small>&#x003C; NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD OR A SANDAL STRAP</small>. By virtue of this I am punishing your enemies, as stated (in Ps. 60:10 [8]): <small>UPON EDOM WILL I CAST MY SHOE</small>. You have refused a reward of flesh and blood. See what a reward is prepared for you with me. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>YOUR REWARD SHALL BE VERY GREAT</small>.</p>
<title>3.18 Genesis 15:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 15:1): <small>AFTER THESE THINGS [THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME UNTO ABRAM] IN THE VISION, SAYING: FEAR NOT, ABRAM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn322">86</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 89:20 [19]): <small>THEN YOU SPOKE TO YOUR SAINTS IN A VISION</small>. This refers to Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>IN THE VISION</small>. Then you said (ibid.): <small>AND SAID: I HAVE CONFERRED HELP UPON A MIGHTY ONE</small>, in that the Holy One helped him against the five kings. (Ibid., cont.): <small>I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE</small>. This <small>ONE</small> is Abraham, in that the Holy One chose him, as stated (in Neh. 9:7): <small>YOU ARE THE LORD, THE GOD WHO CHOSE ABRAM</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 15:1): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM</small>.</p>
<title>3.19 Genesis 15:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>[(Gen. 15:1:) <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM.]</small> This text is related (to Prov. 28:14): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS ALWAYS AFRAID, BUT THE ONE WHO HARDENS HIS HEART WILL FALL INTO EVIL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn323">87</xref></sup> It is also written (in Prov. 14:16): <small>A WISE PERSON FEARS AND TURNS AWAY FROM EVIL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn324">88</xref></sup> Who is he? This is Abraham. And of what was he afraid? Of Shem, whose sons he killed, Chedorlaomer king of Elam and his three sons. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 10:22): <small>THE SONS OF SHEM: ELAM, ASSHUR, ARPACHSHAD, LUD, AND ARAM</small>. So he was afraid, saying: I have killed the children of a saint, and now he will curse me so that I die. What did he do? He went out to meet him there in order to mollify him. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:18): <small>AND MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: By your life I will not curse you but bless you. Thus it is stated (in the next verse): <small>THEN HE BLESSED HIM, AND SAID: BLESSED BE ABRAM</small>&#x2026;. He said to him: Because you have killed my sons, I am blessing you. Thus it is stated (in vs. 20): <small>AND BLESSED BE GOD MOST HIGH, WHO HAS DELIVERED YOUR ENEMIES INTO YOUR HAND</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>WHO HAS DELIVERED (<italic>MGN</italic>) YOUR ENEMIES</small>? The Holy One made a charm (<italic>MNGN&#x2019;</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn325">89</xref></sup> and overthrew them before you. So taking dust, our father Abraham scattered it over them, and it became arrows and bows.<sup><xref rid="fn326">90</xref></sup> Then taking straw, he scattered it over them, and it became swords and spears. Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:2): <small>WHO HAS AROUSED RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE EAST?&#x2026; [HE RENDERS HIS SWORD LIKE DUST, HIS BOW LIKE DRIVEN CHAFF.]</small> This refers to Abraham, of whom it is next stated (in vs. 3): <small>HE PURSUES THEM AND PASSES ON IN PEACE</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 14:20): <small>WHO HAS DELIVERED YOUR ENEMIES INTO YOUR HAND</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: Are you &#x003C; still &#x003E; afraid after these things? (Gen. 15:1:) <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 28:14): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS ALWAYS AFRAID</small>.</p>
<p>So our father Abraham was still afraid when he had killed the kings.<sup><xref rid="fn327">91</xref></sup> He was bewildered and said: Perhaps I have neglected the commandments of the Holy One, which he commanded the children of Noah. (Gen. 9:6:) <small>WHOEVER SHEDS HUMAN BLOOD, &#x003C; BY A HUMAN WILL HIS BLOOD BE SHED &#x003E;</small>. Now I have killed all those multitudes.<sup><xref rid="fn328">92</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 15:1): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM</small>. Rather I must give you a great reward because you have uprooted thorns. It is so stated (in Is. 33:12): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME; THORNS CUT DOWN THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE</small>. It is therefore stated: <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you are anxious over sins, but in the world to come, in which there is no evil drive (<italic>yetser hara</italic>), you will be anxious over the good that I have ordained for you. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 3:5): <small>&#x007B;AND&#x007D; AFTERWARD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL RETURN AND &#x007B;SERVE&#x007D; [SEEK] THE LORD THEIR GOD AND DAVID THEIR KING, AND THEY SHALL BE ANXIOUS FOR THE LORD AND FOR HIS GOODNESS (<italic>TWV</italic>)</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HIS GOODNESS</small>? This refers to the Holy Temple, as &#x003C; the term &#x003E; is used (in Deut. 3:15): <small>THIS GOOD (<italic>TWV</italic>) HILL AND LEBANON</small>. Salvation is from Zion, as stated (in Ps. 14:7): <small>OH THAT THE SALVATION OF ISRAEL WOULD COME OUT OF ZION&#x0021;</small> The blessing is from Zion, as stated (in Ps. 133:3): <small>LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON WHICH COMES DOWN UPON THE HILLS OF ZION, &#x003C; FOR THERE THE LORD HAS COMMANDED THE BLESSING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Help is from Zion, as stated (in Ps. 20:3 [2]): <small>MAY HE SEND YOUR HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY AND SUSTAIN YOU FROM ZION</small>. The Holy One said: In the world to come also I will bless Israel from Zion, for so David has said (in Ps. 134:3): <small>THE LORD WILL BLESS YOU FROM ZION</small>.</p>
<title>3.20 Genesis 17:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 17:1:) <small>WHEN ABRAM WAS NINETY &#x003C; -NINE &#x003E; YEARS OLD</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: Is it correct that one is permitted to heal on the Sabbath?<sup><xref rid="fn329">93</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Yoma</italic> 8:6.): <small>WHERE LIFE IS IN DOUBT, IT OVERRIDES THE SABBATH</small>; but if it is doubtful whether one is recovering or not recovering, one does not override &#x003C; it &#x003E;. For the sake of circumcision, however, one does override the Sabbath. R. Jose said: Come and see how dear circumcision is to the Holy One. When he told Abraham that he should be circumcised, it was hard on him. He said: If I circumcise &#x003C; myself &#x003E; now, I am lacking one member (&#x2019;<italic>BR</italic>). The Holy One said to him: Before you circumcise yourself, [your name is Abram &#x2019;<italic>BRM</italic>] and the numerical value of its letters is 243. Now, since a person has 248 members, it is evident that you are lacking five members.<sup><xref rid="fn330">94</xref></sup> But when you circumcise yourself, you are whole. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, how so? He said to him (in Gen. 17:5): <small>YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE CALLED ABRAM, BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ABRAHAM (&#x2019;<italic>BRHM</italic>)</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn331">95</xref></sup> and you shall become whole.</p>
<title>3.21 Genesis 17:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 17:1:) <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS</small>. This text is related (to Hos. 9:10): <small>I HAVE FOUND &#x007B;YOUR ANCESTORS&#x007D; [ISRAEL] LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT; [I HAVE SEEN YOUR ANCESTORS LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON]</small>. &#x003C; The text &#x003E; speaks about Israel. When it stood at Mount Sinai, it resembled grapes. Just as grapes are beautiful on the outside and ugly on the inside, so was Israel when it stood at Mount Sinai and responded (according to Exod. 24:7): <small>WE WILL DO AND OBEY</small>. Note that &#x003C; the response was &#x003E; with their mouth, but their heart was not steadfast. Thus David has said (in Ps. 78:36-37): <small>YET THEY DECEIVED HIM WITH THEIR MOUTH, AND WITH THEIR TONGUE THEY LIED TO HIM, FOR THEIR HEART WAS NOT STEADFAST WITH HIM</small>. See, &#x003C; they were &#x003E; <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>. Just as the grapes have food and drink within them, so Israel has within itself children of Torah (i.e., scholars) and has within itself children of action.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Just as these grapes have seeds within them, so did Israel. It is so stated (in Numb. 11:4): <small>THEN THE RABBLE WHICH WAS IN THEIR MIDST &#x003C; BECAME FILLED WITH LUST &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Hos. 9:10): <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>. Now why does it say <small>DESERT</small>, and not &#x201C;settlement&#x201C;? When someone is walking in the desert, if they give him something to eat, he wants to drink; and if they give him something to drink, he wants to eat. If, however, they have given him grapes, he eats them and does not desire anything, because they have within themselves &#x003C; both &#x003E; food and drink.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Another interpretation: <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>.&#x007D; [(Hos. 9:10, cont.:) <small>LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE</small>.] &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; compares the ancestors with the fig tree. Just as this fig tree has several kernels<sup><xref rid="fn332">96</xref></sup> in &#x003C; its figs &#x003E;, so the ancestors of the world had several good works in them.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>LIKE EARLY FIGS ON A FIG TREE</small>. Just as this fig has no waste at all in it, &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; Whatever one eats has waste in it, and one throws away some of it; but in the case of the fig, one throws away none of it at all. &#x003C; Just as this fig has no waste at all in it &#x003E;, so the Holy One said to Abraham: You are whole, and there is no wasteful deficiency in you except the foreskin.<sup><xref rid="fn333">97</xref></sup> Remove this and be perfect. Thus it is stated (at the end of Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT</small>.</p>
<title>3.22 Genesis 17:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS NINETY &#x003C; -NINE &#x003E; YEARS OLD</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 45:3f. [4f.]): <small>YOU ARE FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF ADAM; GRACE IS POURED OUT ON YOUR LIPS &#x2026; GIRD YOUR SWORD UPON YOUR THIGH, O MIGHTY ONE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn334">98</xref></sup> About whom do the children of Korah speak this psalm? About Abraham. He was fairer than children of the first Adam. And who were his children? Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah. Moreover, some of the children of Noah are called children of Adam. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 11:5): <small>AND THE TOWER WHICH THE CHILDREN OF ADAM HAD BUILT</small>. (Ps. 45:3 [2]:) <small>GRACE IS POURED OUT ON YOUR LIPS</small>. How was that? When you swore to the king of Sodom. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:22f.): <small>THEN ABRAM SAID UNTO THE KING OF SODOM: I HAVE RAISED MY HAND (in an oath) UNTO THE LORD GOD MOST HIGH &#x2026; THAT &#x003C; I WILL TAKE NOT &#x003E; SO MUCH AS A THREAD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GRACE &#x2026; ON YOUR LIPS</small>? When you spoke, grace poured out. And what was his reward? That the Holy One said this to him: Leave me all that you have done and everything for which you have been proud of yourself. You descended into the fiery furnace and experienced a lot of trials for my name. You arose and pursued the kings. But you have been proud of yourself in the world for all that you have done. From now on, you will seek to make my valor known. (Ps. 45:4 [3]:) <small>GIRD ON YOUR SWORD</small>. Put circumcision between your thighs. In that hour your glory and splendor shall be in the world. When? (Gen. 17:1-2:) <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS &#x2026; AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.23 Genesis 17:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 17:2:) <small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 25:14): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM, AND HE MAKES HIS COVENANT KNOWN TO THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn335">99</xref></sup> What is the secret of the Holy One. This is circumcision, since the Holy One revealed the mystery<sup><xref rid="fn336">100</xref></sup> of circumcision to no one but Abraham, as stated (ibid.): <small>THE SECRET (<italic>SWD</italic>) OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>. What is the meaning of <small><italic>SWD</italic></small>? One&#x2019;s years: <italic>S</italic> is sixty; <italic>W</italic> is six; <italic>D</italic> is four. That makes seventy years. See, the Holy One said: Out of you I am raising up seventy souls, as stated (in Deut. 10:22): <small>WITH SEVENTY SOULS &#x003C; DID YOUR ANCESTORS GO DOWN TO EGYPT &#x003E;</small>. And out of them &#x003C; I &#x003E; am raising up seventy elders, as stated (in Numb. 11:16): &#x003C; <small>GATHER FOR ME &#x003E; SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>. And I am raising up Moses, who will study the Torah in seventy languages, as stated (in Deut. 1:5f.): <small>&#x003C; MOSES UNDERTOOK TO EXPOUND &#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn337">101</xref></sup> <small>THIS TORAH, SAYING: THE LORD SPOKE TO US IN HOREB</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 25:4): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>. He said to him: It is enough for a slave to be equal to his owner.<sup><xref rid="fn338">102</xref></sup> It is comparable to a king who had a friend that had more than enough wealth. The king said: What shall I give to my friend? He has silver and gold, male and female slaves, and cattle. But look, I will gird him with my armor.<sup><xref rid="fn339">103</xref></sup> Thus the Holy One said: What shall I give to you? I have already given you silver and gold, male and female slaves, and cattle, as stated (in Gen. 13:2): <small>AND ABRAM WAS VERY RICH &#x003C; IN CATTLE, IN SILVER, AND IN GOLD &#x003E;</small>. So what shall I give you? It is enough for you to be like me, as stated (in Gen. 17:2-4): <small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU &#x2026; THEN ABRAHAM FELL UPON HIS FACE &#x2026; AS FOR ME, BEHOLD, MY COVENANT IS WITH YOU</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 25:14): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.</p>
<title>3.24 Genesis 17:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>WHEN ABRAHAM WAS NINETY &#x003C; -NINE &#x003E; YEARS OLD</small>. The Holy One said to him: When I had created my world, I was patient &#x003C; with you &#x003E; for twenty generations<sup><xref rid="fn340">104</xref></sup> until you would come and receive circumcision. So now, if you do not accept &#x003C; circumcision &#x003E;, it is enough for me that the world &#x003C; has existed &#x003E; until now; and I am returning it to being void and without form.<sup><xref rid="fn341">105</xref></sup> It is unnecessary for me that the world &#x003C; exist &#x003E; any longer. He therefore said (in Gen. 17:1): <small>I AM GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>. I have had enough (<italic>DY</italic>), O world. But if you accept &#x003C; circumcision &#x003E; for yourself, we are enough for the world, &#x003C; just &#x003E; I and you.</p>
<p>(Gen. 17:2:)<small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU</small>. Abram said to him: And who will circumcise me?<sup><xref rid="fn342">106</xref></sup> He said to him: You yourself. Abraham took the knife and took hold of his foreskin, but he was afraid; because he was old, he was shaking. He said to him: Sovereign of the world, I am an old man. What did the Holy One do, as it were? He stretched out his hand and took hold along with him.<sup><xref rid="fn343">107</xref></sup> So Abraham cut away until he had performed circumcision. Thus Ezra gives praise and says (in Neh. 9:6, 8): <small>YOU ALONE ARE THE LORD &#x2026; AND YOU FOUND HIS HEART FAITHFUL BEFORE YOU, &#x003C; AND CUT THE COVENANT ALONG WITH HIM &#x003E;</small>. &#x201C;And cut the covenant for him&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>AND CUT THE COVENANT ALONG WITH HIM</small>. Then there is written at the end of the verse: <small>AND YOU HAVE KEPT YOUR WORDS BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why did he circumcise at the age of ninety-nine?<sup><xref rid="fn344">108</xref></sup> In order to teach proselytes that if a proselyte wants to become a Jew, he should not say: I am an old man. At this stage I am not becoming a Jew. Let him learn from Abraham, who performed circumcision when he was ninety-nine years old.</p>
<title>3.25 Genesis 17:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 17:1, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: I AM GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>&#x2019;L ShDY</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn345">109</xref></sup> Enough (<italic>DY</italic>) of foreskin&#x0021; Up to now foreskin has been customary, but circumcision has been concealed. It is enough (<italic>DY</italic>) for the world that I am his God.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 17:1): <small>I AM GOD ALMIGHTY (&#x2019;<italic>L ShDY</italic>)</small>. R. Abbahu said: When the Holy One created his world, he created the heavens and the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn346">110</xref></sup> Then he told them that they should continue to spread out, as stated (in Is. 40:22): <small>&#x003C; WHO HAS STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN &#x003E; AND SPREAD THEM OUT LIKE A TENT TO DWELL IN</small>. If he had not said: Enough&#x0021; to them, they would have continued to be spread out until the dead rise (at the end of time). &#x003C; What &#x003E; the Holy One said to Abraham &#x003C; was &#x003E;: I am the one who said to my world: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>)&#x0021; So &#x003C; also &#x003E; he says to foreskin: Enough&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Gen. 17:1, cont.:) <small>WALK BEFORE ME &#x003C; AND BE PERFECT &#x003E;</small>. Before he performed circumcision, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; never said: <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. Why? Because he was uncircumcised. After he performed circumcision, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; said: <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. Before he performed circumcision, he was not whole. After he performed circumcision, he became whole.</p>
<title>3.26 Genesis 17:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>It is written of Noah (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. It is also written of Abraham (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>. One who reads &#x003C; this might &#x003E; think that Noah was greater than Abraham, but it is not so. R. Johanan and Resh Laqish differed.<sup><xref rid="fn347">111</xref></sup> R. Johanan told &#x003C; this &#x003E; parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had two sons, one elder and one younger. The younger would hold onto him so as not to fall, but the elder would walk before him. Thus it is written of Noah: <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. &#x003C; He did so &#x003E; lest he be drowned with the generation of the flood. In the case of Abraham, however, because he was without peer in the world and was righteous, to him the Holy One said (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT</small>. Resh Laqish &#x003C; also &#x003E; told a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend who was sunk in the mire. He took hold of his hand and lifted him out of the mire. So Noah was sunk in the mire. The Holy One saw him, gave him a hand, and raised him out of the mire. Then to what was Abraham comparable? To a king who used to walk in the dark. His friend came, saw him, and provided him with light. The king said to him: As long as you are providing me with light, come and go before me. Thus [in the days of] Abraham the whole world was wicked, while he was righteous. The Holy One said to him: As long as you are providing light in the east, <small>WALK BEFORE ME</small>.</p>
<p>It is written of Noah (in Gen. 6:9): <small>NOAH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. It is also written concerning the ancestors of the world (in Gen. 48:15): <small>THE GOD BEFORE WHOM MY ANCESTORS &#x003C; ABRAHAM AND ISAAC &#x003E; WALKED</small>. R. Johanan said: To what were the ancestors comparable &#x003C; in their position &#x003E; before the Holy One? To a shepherd who walks with his flock before him. Resh Laqish said: Up to now the flock has been necessary for the shepherd. Then to what were the ancestors comparable &#x003C; in their position &#x003E; before the Holy One? To a prince who walks with his elders before him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 48:15): <small>BEFORE WHOM MY ANCESTORS &#x003C; ABRAHAM AND ISAAC &#x003E; WALKED</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 17:1): <small>WALK BEFORE ME AND BE PERFECT</small>.</p>
<title>3.27 Genesis 17:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Gen. 17:2:) <small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU</small>. R. Hanina ben Pazzi said: Abraham did not know where to be circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn348">112</xref></sup> The Holy One gave him a hint to tell &#x003C; him &#x003E; where to be circumcised (in Gen.17:2, cont.): <small>AND LET ME MULTIPLY YOU</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; out of the place from which you are fruitful and multiply. Bar Qappara said: Abraham had interpreted &#x003C; according to the principle of &#x003E; <italic>qal wahomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn349">113</xref></sup> There is a comparison with trees. Where do they have an obligation concerning foreskin? At the place where they produce fruit.<sup><xref rid="fn350">114</xref></sup> I also must be circumcised at the place where I produce fruit.</p>
<p>(Gen. 17:3:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM FELL ON HIS FACE</small>. Before he performed circumcision, he would fall &#x003C; on his face before the Holy One &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn351">115</xref></sup> After he performed circumcision he did not fall &#x003C; on his face &#x003E;. Moreover, the wicked go down into Gehinnom only because of foreskin, as stated (in Is. 5:14): <small>THEREFORE SHEOL HAS ENLARGED ITS DESIRE &#x003C; AND OPENED ITS MOUTH FOR THOSE WITHOUT A STATUTE &#x003E;</small> (i.e., without circumcision). In the world to come, however, the Holy One will save Israel from Gehinnom by virtue of circumcision, as stated (in Prov. 31:21): <small>SHE (i.e., Israel) HAS NO FEAR FOR HER HOUSEHOLD ON ACCOUNT OF (Gehinnom&#x2019;s) SNOW BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE DRESSED IN SCARLET</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn352">116</xref></sup></p>

<p>(Gen. 18:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: How many blessings does one pray every day?<sup><xref rid="fn353">1</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ber.</italic> 4:3): <small>ONE MUST PRAY THE EIGHTEEN BENEDICTIONS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn354">2</xref></sup> And why eighteen?<sup><xref rid="fn355">3</xref></sup> &#x003C; They &#x003E; correspond to the eighteen references to the Divine Name which are written in (Ps. 29) <small>ASCRIBE TO THE LORD, O HEAVENLY BEINGS</small>. They reply to R. Levi:<sup><xref rid="fn356">4</xref></sup> But does not one say nineteen in Babylon? He said to them: That also is from references to the Divine Name, as stated (in Ps. 29:3): <small>THE GOD (<italic>El</italic>) OF GLORY THUNDERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn357">5</xref></sup> R. Simon said: &#x003C; The Eighteen &#x003E; correspond to the eighteen vertebrae which are in the spine, since when one stands to pray, it is necessary to bend over with all of them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 35:10): <small>ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY: LORD, WHO IS LIKE YOU</small>? The Holy One said: Be strictly observant in prayer, for you have no finer way than that. And even though a person is not worth answering, I shall show him loving-kindness, since all my ways are loving-kindness. R. Simlay said: Do you want to know that all the Holy One&#x2019;s ways are loving-kindness?<sup><xref rid="fn358">6</xref></sup> At the beginning of Torah he has adorned the bride, as stated (in Gen. 2:22): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD BUILT THE RIB &#x003C; WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE HUMAN INTO A WOMAN</small> &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn359">7</xref></sup> Also at the end of &#x003C; the Torah &#x003E; there is loving-kindness in that he buried the dead, as stated (in Deut. 34:6): <small>THEN HE (THE HOLY ONE) BURIED HIM (MOSES) IN THE VALLEY</small>. Moreover, in the middle &#x003C; of the Torah &#x003E; he visited the sick, as stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>. As soon as Abraham had circumcised &#x003C; himself &#x003E; (in Gen. 17:24), the Holy One and his entourage<sup><xref rid="fn360">8</xref></sup> came to visit him. &#x007B;It is so stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown?

(Is. 66:3, cont.:) <small>WHO SLAYS A HUMAN</small> &#x003C; refers to &#x003E; the one who killed Nimrod, &#x003C; and &#x003E; Nimrod is Amraphel (of Gen. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn363">11</xref></sup> (Is. 66:3, cont.:) <small>WHO SACRIFICES THE LAMB</small>. When? When he offered up his son Isaac as stated (in Gen. 22:8): <small>GOD WILL SEE TO THE LAMB [FOR A BURNT OFFERING], MY SON</small>.</p>
<title>4.3 Genesis 18:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 66:1-2): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: THE HEAVENS ARE MY THRONE &#x2026; FOR ALL THESE THINGS HAS MY HAND MADE &#x2026; &#x003C; YET UNTO THIS PERSON WILL I LOOK: UNTO ONE WHO IS POOR AND OF A CONTRITE SPIRIT</small> &#x003E;. Our masters have said in the name of R. Eliezer ben Pedat:<sup><xref rid="fn364">12</xref></sup> In seven places you find that the Holy One has compared himself with lowly hearts.<sup><xref rid="fn365">13</xref></sup> Where are they?</p>
<ol>
<li>Where it is stated (in Deut. 10:17): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GOD OF GODS</small>&#x2026;. See how great is &#x003C; his &#x003E; might and how great is &#x003C; his &#x003E; praise&#x0021; Then what is written next (in vs. 18)? <small>HE SECURES JUSTICE FOR THE ORPHAN AND WIDOW</small>.</li>
<li>It is also written (in Ps. 138:6): <small>FOR THOUGH THE LORD IS HIGH, HE HAS REGARD FOR THE HUMBLE</small>&#x2026;.</li>
<li>It is also written (in Is. 57:15): <small>[FOR] THUS SAYS THE HIGH AND EXALTED ONE, WHO INHABITS ETERNITY, WHOSE NAME IS HOLY: I INHABIT THE HIGH AND HOLY PLACE, WITH ONE ALSO THAT IS OF A CONTRITE AND HUMBLE SPIRIT</small>.</li>
<li>It is also written (in Is. 66:1): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: THE HEAVENS ARE MY THRONE AND THE EARTH IS MY FOOTSTOOL</small>&#x2026;. Then there is written (in vs. 2): <small>ALL THESE MY HAND HAS MADE &#x2026; YET UNTO THIS PERSON WILL I LOOK: UNTO ONE WHO IS POOR AND OF A CONTRITE SPIRIT</small>.</li>
<li>And the rest are in the Book of Psalms (10:16): <small>THE LORD IS KING FOR EVER AND EVER</small>. Then there is written after that (in vs. 17): <small>THE LONGING OF THE MEEK YOU HAVE HEARD, O LORD</small>&#x2026;.</li>
<li>It is also written (in Ps. 68:5 [4]): <small>SING TO GOD, PRAISE HIS NAME, BUILD A WAY FOR THE ONE WHO RIDES IN THE DESERT</small>. What is written after it (in vs. 6 [5])? <small>A FATHER OF ORPHANS AND AN ADVOCATE OF WIDOWS</small>.</li>
<li>It is also written (in Ps. 146:1): <small>HALLELUJAH. PRAISE THE LORD, O MY SOUL</small>&#x0021; And there is written in the same psalm (at vs. 6): <small>WHO MADE HEAVEN AND EARTH</small>. Then there is written (in vs. 7): <small>WHO SECURES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED</small>&#x2026;.</li>
</ol>
<p>For what reason did he come to Abraham? For the reason that he was sitting &#x003C; there &#x003E; suffering from his circumcision. He therefore came to visit him.</p>
<title>4.4 Genesis 18:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>&#x2026;. R. Isaac the Smith began (with Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>AN ALTAR OF EARTH YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn366">14</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Whoever slaughters an ox or a lamb and sheds a little blood, such a one I am coming to bless. Thus it is stated: <small>AN ALTAR OF EARTH &#x003C; YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME, AND YOU SHALL SACRIFICE UPON IT YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND YOUR PEACE OFFERINGS, YOUR SHEEP AND YOUR OXEN &#x003E;</small>. Then it is written (ibid.): <small>I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. How much the more must I bless Abraham, since a river of blood was pouring forth from his house because of the circumcision&#x0021; It is therefore stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>. So also Moses said (in Lev. 9:6): <small>THIS IS THE THING WHICH THE LORD HAS COMMANDED &#x003C; YOU TO DO &#x003E; THAT &#x003C; THE GLORY OF THE LORD &#x003E; MAY APPEAR UNTO YOU</small>. What did the <small>LORD</small> say (in vs. 7)? <small>THEN MOSES SAID UNTO AARON: DRAW NEAR &#x003C; UNTO THE ALTAR AND PERFORM YOUR SIN OFFERING AND YOUR BURNT OFFERING TO ATONE FOR YOURSELF &#x2026; AS THE LORD HAS COMMANDED &#x003E;</small>. R. Aha said: Come and see the power which the Holy One set in Abraham, who in one day circumcised himself, the slaves born in his house, and his son Ishmael. So the blood was dripping.<sup><xref rid="fn367">15</xref></sup> Look at how many of his home-born slaves there were&#x0021; According to what is written (in Gen. 14:14), <small>HE MUSTERED HIS THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN HOME-BORN SLAVES</small>. Now, if his home-born slaves numbered so many, how many more were those which his money had purchased&#x0021; And he circumcised them all in a single day, as stated (in Gen. 17:26f.): <small>ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM AND HIS SON ISHMAEL WERE CIRCUMCISED; AND ALL THE MEN OF HIS HOUSE, &#x003C; HOME-BORN SLAVES AND ONES PURCHASED WITH MONEY FROM A FOREIGNER &#x003E;, WERE CIRCUMCISED ALONG WITH HIM</small>. Then Abraham took all the foreskins which he had circumcised and made a mound of them in the midst of his house, with the result that a river of blood flowed forth from the midst of his house. So the Holy One called the angels and said to them: Come, let us visit the sick one. They said to him: Sovereign of the World, (Ps. 8:5): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM AND A CHILD OF ADAM THAT YOU SHOULD VISIT HIM&#x0021;</small> Also, are you going into a place of defilement, into a place of blood and of uncleanness? He said to them: So you have said. By your life, the odor of this blood is sweeter to me than myrrh and frankincense. If you are not going, then I am going by myself. And so has Solomon said (in Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL&#x2026; &#x003C; I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE &#x003E;</small>. (Josh. 5:3:) <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FORESKINS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn368">16</xref></sup> This &#x003C; refers to &#x003E; Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM &#x2026; IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY</small>, since the Holy One had made that day hot.<sup><xref rid="fn369">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL</small>. This &#x003C; refers to the story about &#x003E; the travelers whom &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; fed. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, since he was not suffering from the circumcision because he was attending them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH (<italic>mor</italic>)</small>. This &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn370">18</xref></sup> of whom it is stated (in Ps. 45:9 [8]): <small>MYRRH, ALOES, AND CASSIA &#x003C; ARE ON ALL YOUR GARMENTS &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn371">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL</small>. This &#x003C; refers to &#x003E; the day of judgment. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, since the wicked have no &#x003C; protective &#x003E; shadow. It is so stated (in Job 34:22): <small>THERE IS NEITHER DARKNESS NOR SHADOW OF DEATH FOR WORKERS OF VANITY TO BE HIDDEN</small>. (Cant. 4:6, cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH</small>. This is the Holy Temple where they would burn the offering of myrrh.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:6): <small>UNTIL THE DAY BECOMES COOL</small>. Until the kingdom of the Holy One appears in this world. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SHADOWS FLEE</small>, i.e., the shadows of the kingdom. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH</small>, i.e., Jerusalem. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 5:1): <small>WHEN I COME TO MY GARDEN, MY SISTER, MY BRIDE, I HAVE PLUCKED MY MYRRH ALONG WITH MY SPICE</small>. (Josh. 5:3:) <small>UNTO THE MOUND OF FORESKINS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn372">20</xref></sup> since he took the foreskins and made a mound of them. For that reason the Holy One was revealed to him, as stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>THEN &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; APPEARED UNTO HIM</small>. Now when the angels saw this, they also came along with the Holy One, as stated (in Gen. 18:2): <small>WHEN HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND LOOKED, BEHOLD, THERE WERE THREE MEN &#x003C; STANDING NEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>. And so David gives praise (in Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>? &#x003C; With reference to &#x003E; the Torah, its beginning is steadfast love,<sup><xref rid="fn373">21</xref></sup> its end is steadfast love, and its middle is steadfast love. Its beginning is steadfast love. Where is it shown? You find that when the Holy One formed Eve, he adorned her and brought her to Adam, as stated (in Gen. 2:22): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD BUILT THE RIB &#x003C; WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE HUMAN INTO A WOMAN &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUILT</small>? R. Abbahu said: In Arabia they call the plaited coiffure a &#x201C;building.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn374">22</xref></sup> Its end is steadfast love, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; at Moses&#x2019; death when the Holy One attended him in his glory,<sup><xref rid="fn375">23</xref></sup> as stated (in Deut. 34:6): <small>AND HE BURIED HIM IN THE VALLEY</small>. At the middle there is steadfast love in the case of Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 17:2): <small>AND LET ME PUT MY COVENANT BETWEEN ME AND YOU</small>. When the Holy One was revealed to him, he was sitting, as stated (in Gen. 18:1): <small>&#x003C; THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM &#x003E; &#x2026; AS HE WAS SITTING AT THE TENT DOOR IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn376">24</xref></sup> Abraham went to stand up. The Holy One said to him: Do not trouble yourself to stand up. Sit down&#x0021; It is so stated (in Ps. 110:1): <small>THE LORD (God) SAID TO MY LORD (Abraham): SIT DOWN AT MY RIGHT HAND</small>. Abraham said to him: Is this good manners for me to be sitting while you are standing? The Holy One said to him: Do not trouble yourself. You are an old man of a hundred years. Sit down&#x0021; The Holy One said to him: By your life, because you are sitting while I stand, your children at the age of three years, at the age of four years, are going to be sitting in the academies and in the synagogues with me standing over them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>. Abraham began to praise<sup><xref rid="fn377">25</xref></sup> God (according to Ps. 18:36 [35]): <small>YOU ALSO GAVE ME THE SHIELD OF YOUR SALVATION</small>, when the kings had pursued &#x003C; me &#x003E;. It is so stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>FEAR NOT, ABRAM, I AM YOUR SHIELD</small>. (Ps. 18:36 [35], cont.:) <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND SUSTAINED ME</small>, when you grasped the foreskin along with me as I was cutting. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOUR CONDESCENSION MAGNIFIED ME</small>, in that I was sitting while you were standing.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:1): <small>AS HE WAS SITTING AT THE TENT DOOR IN (literally: AS) THE HEAT OF THE DAY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AS THE HEAT OF THE DAY</small>? That the Holy One made that day as hot as the day of judgment. It is so stated (in Mal. 3:19 [4:1]): <small>FOR, BEHOLD, THE DAY IS AT HAND, BURNING LIKE AN OVEN</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.5 Genesis 18:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 18:2:) <small>WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES, HE LOOKED, &#x003C; AND BEHOLD, THREE PERSONS WERE STANDING NEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Simay said: The Holy One said to Abraham: By virtue of three races which you ran, by your life, when I come to give Torah to Israel, I am running three races before them. Now these are the three races which Abraham ran:<sup><xref rid="fn378">26</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE RAN TO MEET THEM</small>. (Ibid., vs. 7:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD</small>. (Ibid., vs. 6:) <small>SO ABRAHAM HASTENED TO THE TENT</small>&#x2026;. Here are three races. The Holy One also repaid his children in kind for him at Sinai, as stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AND HE SAID: THE LORD CAME FORTH FROM SINAI, &#x003C; AND SHONE UPON THEM FROM SEIR, HE; HE APPEARED FROM MOUNT PARAN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you said (in Gen. 18:4): <small>PLEASE (<italic>na</italic>) LET A LITTLE WATER BE BROUGHT (rt.: <italic>LQH</italic>)</small>. With that very word I am redeeming you from Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 6:7): <small>AND I WILL TAKE (rt.: <italic>LQH</italic>) YOU TO BE MY &#x003C; PEOPLE &#x003E;</small>. So much for this world. [Where is it shown] in regard to the world to come? Where it is stated (in Jer. 3:14): <small>I WILL TAKE (rt.: <italic>LQH</italic>) YOU, ONE FROM A TOWN AND TWO FROM A CLAN, &#x003C; AND BRING YOU TO ZION &#x003E;</small>. You said to them (in Gen. 18:4): <small>PLEASE (<italic>na</italic>)</small>. By your life, with that very word I am admonishing (rt.: <italic>YKH</italic>) your children, as stated (in Is. 1:18): <small>PLEASE (<italic>na</italic>) COME, LET US REASON (rt.: <italic>YKH</italic>) TOGETHER, SAYS THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. You said to them (in 18:4): <small>A LITTLE (<italic>me&#x2018;at</italic>)</small>. By your life, with that very word I am driving out the peoples from before your children, as stated (in Exod. 23:30): <small>LITTLE BY LITTLE (<italic>me&#x2018;at me&#x2018;at</italic>) I WILL DRIVE THEM OUT FROM BEFORE YOU</small>. And where is it also shown for the world to come? Where it is stated (in Hag. 2:6f.): <small>FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD &#x007B;GOD&#x007D; [OF HOSTS]: IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE (<italic>me&#x2018;at</italic>) LONGER I WILL SHAKE &#x003C; THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH, THE SEA AND THE DRY COUNTRY; I WILL SHAKE THE NATIONS &#x003E;</small>. You said to them (in 18:4): <small>WATER</small>. By your life, I am raising up a well for your children, as stated (in Numb. 21:17): <small>RISE UP, O WELL&#x0021; SING TO IT</small>. And where is it also shown after they had entered the land? Where it is stated (in Deut. 8:7): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND, [A LAND WITH STREAMS OF WATER]</small>&#x2026;. Where is it also shown for the world to come? Where it is stated (in Is. 30:25): <small>THEN UPON [EVERY] HIGH MOUNTAIN [AND UPON EVERY LOFTY HILL THERE SHALL BE BROOKS AND STREAMS OF WATER].</small></p>
<title>4.6 Genesis 18:17ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 18:17:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &#x003C; WHAT I AM DOING &#x003E;</small>? Let our master instruct us: When someone is translating for one reading the Torah, is it correct for him to look at a written text?<sup><xref rid="fn379">27</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: The translator is forbidden to look at a written text, and the reader is forbidden to take his eyes away from the Torah since the Torah was given only in a written text, as stated (in Exod. 34:1): <small>AND I WILL WRITE UPON THE TABLETS</small>. But it is forbidden for the translator to look at the Torah. R. Judah ben Pazzi said: There is a text (Exod. 34:27) which explicitly proves &#x003C; this injunction &#x003E;: <small>WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small>. Thus, the Scripture was given in writing. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR THESE WORDS ARE BY MOUTH</small>. Here is &#x003C; a reference to &#x003E; the translation, which is given by word of mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn380">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Judah bar Simon said (Ibid., cont.): <small>I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH YOU AND WITH ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C; It was done &#x003E; through writing and through word of mouth: <small>FOR THESE WORDS ARE BY MOUTH</small>. If you preserve what is in writing in writing and what is by word of mouth by word of mouth, <small>I HAVE MADE &#x003C; A COVENANT &#x003E; WITH YOU</small>. But, &#x003C; if &#x003E; you change what is by mouth into writing and what is in writing into word of mouth, <small>I HAVE not MADE &#x003C; A COVENANT &#x003E; WITH YOU</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said:<sup><xref rid="fn381">29</xref></sup> Moses wanted the Mishnah also to be in writing, but the Holy One foresaw that the peoples of the world were going to translate the Torah and read it in Greek. Then they would say: We too are Israel. The Holy One said to him (in Hos. 8:12): <small>SHOULD I WRITE THE FULL ABUNDANCE OF MY TORAH (i.e., including the Mishnah) FOR YOU</small>? If so, <small>THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN RECKONED AS STRANGERS</small>. And why all this? Because the Mishnah is a mystery<sup><xref rid="fn382">30</xref></sup> belonging to the Holy One, and the Holy One reveals his mystery only to the righteous. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 25:14): <small>THE SECRET OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>. And so you find that even when the Holy One was angry over Sodom because of their evil deeds and when the Holy One sought to destroy Sodom, the Holy One did not seal their judgment until he had consulted with Abraham. &#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what we have read on the matter] (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &#x003C; WHAT I AM DOING &#x003E;</small>?</p>
<title>4.7 Genesis 18:17ff., Part II</title>
<p>It is written (in Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE AND GOOD FAVOR IN THE EYES OF GOD AND HUMANITY</small>. You have one who is pleasing to the king but is not pleasing to the people of the king&#x2019;s palace.<sup><xref rid="fn383">31</xref></sup> There is also one who is pleasing to the people of the palace and not pleasing to the king. In the case of the righteous, however, when they are pleasing before the Holy One, they are pleasing before angels and before mortals. This is what you find in &#x003C; the case of &#x003E; Daniel. When the angel came to him, he called that person beloved three times: (Dan. 10:11:) <small>&#x003C; O DANIEL &#x003E;, GREATLY BELOVED ONE, UNDERSTAND THE WORDS</small>. It is also written (in Dan. 10:19): <small>FEAR NOT, O GREATLY BELOVED ONE&#x0021;</small> (Dan. 9:23:) <small>AND I HAVE COME TO DECLARE &#x003C; IT &#x003E; BECAUSE YOU ARE &#x007B;ONE WHO IS&#x007D; GREATLY BELOVED</small>. And why did he call him <small>GREATLY BELOVED</small> three times? It is simply that a person is blessed when the angel brings him good news and says: You are beloved before the Holy One. You are also praised among the heavenly beings and beloved with your generation. Bezalel also was praised before the heavenly beings and among lower beings as well. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 31:2f.): <small>SEE, I HAVE CALLED BEZALEL &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; BY NAME; &#x003C; AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It is also written (in Exod. 35:30f.): <small>THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; BY NAME; &#x003C; AND HE HAS FILLED HIM WITH THE SPIRIT OF GOD, IN WISDOM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. See, &#x003C; he is praised in one verse &#x003E; among the heavenly beings; see, &#x003C; he is praised in the other verse &#x003E; among the lower beings. Ergo, it says (in Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE &#x003C; AND GOOD FAVOR IN THE EYES OF GOD AND HUMANITY &#x003E;.</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:4): <small>SO YOU SHALL FIND GRACE</small>. This is Abraham, who was pleasing to mortals and to angels. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 23:6): <small>HEAR ME, MY LORD &#x003C; ABRAHAM &#x003E;, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST</small>. Ergo, &#x003C; he was pleasing &#x003E; to mortals. Where is it shown &#x003C; that he was pleasing &#x003E; to the Holy One and to angels? Where it is stated (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &#x003C; WHAT I AM DOING &#x003E;</small> ?</p>
<p>R. Levi said: Why did the Holy One give a revelation to Abraham? Because he had reflected in his heart about the generation of the flood, and said: It is impossible that there are not some righteous ones among them. You yourself know that it is so. <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &#x003C; WHAT I AM DOING &#x003E;</small>? What did &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; answer him (in Gen. 18:23)? <small>WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED</small>?</p>
<p>R. Levi said: That thing which Abraham said is the same thing which Job said.<sup><xref rid="fn384">32</xref></sup> Job, however, swallowed unripe fruit (i.e., spoke rashly), &#x003C; while &#x003E; Abraham ate it cooked. Job said (in Job 9:22): <small>IT IS ALL ONE; THEREFORE, I SAY: HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. But Abraham, who was wiser, said: <small>WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY</small> &#x2026; ? &#x003C; Then &#x003E; he repented and said (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING, TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE, SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED&#x0021;</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why did the Holy One give a revelation to Abraham? R. Judah the Levite spoke a parable:<sup><xref rid="fn385">33</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and gave it to his friend as a gift. After some days the king needed to cut down &#x003C; some &#x003E; beams from it. The king said: Although it was mine, I gave it to my friend. I shall not cut them until I consult with my friend. So &#x003C; it was with &#x003E; the Holy One. When he brought &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; up into the land of Israel, he said to him (in Gen. 13:14f.): <small>PLEASE LIFT UP YOUR EYES AND LOOK &#x007B;TOWARD THE SEA AND TOWARD THE NORTH&#x007D;</small> &#x2026; and it is also written (in the next verse): <small>[FOR] ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, &#x003C; TO YOU WILL I GIVE IT, AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER &#x003E;</small>. When, therefore, the Holy One wanted to destroy those five cities, he said: I am not destroying them without Abraham knowing. If you should say that they were not part of the land of Canaan, see what is written (in Gen. 10:19): <small>AND THE BORDER OF CANAAN WAS FROM ZIDON, &#x003C; AS YOU GO TOWARD GERAR, UNTO GAZA; AS YOU GO TO SODOM, GOMORRAH, ADMAH, AND ZEBOIIM, UNTO LASHA &#x003E;</small>. He did not, therefore, destroy them until he had consulted with Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 18:17): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: SHALL I HIDE FROM ABRAHAM &#x003C; WHAT I AM DOING &#x003E;</small>?</p>
<title>4.8 Genesis 18:17ff., Part III</title>
<p>It is written (in Job 20:23): <small>LET IT BE FOR FILLING HIS BELLY, LET HIM CAST HIS BURNING ANGER AT HIM, AND LET HIM BRING DOWN RAIN UPON &#x007B;THEM&#x007D; [HIM] IN HIS FLESH (<italic>LEHUM</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn386">34</xref></sup> The retribution which came upon the Sodomites was for filling their belly, because they had filled their belly with transgressions, violence, and plunder. Therefore, when retribution came upon them, it filled their belly, as stated (ibid.): <small>LET HIM CAST HIS BURNING ANGER AT &#x007B;THEM&#x007D; [HIM]</small>. R. Me&#x2019;ir said about the destruction of Sodom: The Scripture says (ibid.): <small>AND LET HIM BRING DOWN RAIN UPON &#x007B;THEM&#x007D; [HIM] IN HIS <italic>LEHUM</italic></small>. (Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS <italic>LEHUM</italic> (rt.: <italic>LHM</italic>)?</small> &#x003C; That it happened &#x003E; because of the wars (rt.: <italic>LHM</italic>) which they had fought with the Holy One. Thus it was stated (in Gen. 13:13): <small>NOW THE PEOPLE OF SODOM WERE EVIL AND SINFUL AGAINST THE LORD, EXCEEDINGLY SO</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn387">35</xref></sup> &#x003C; They were &#x003E; <small>EVIL</small> to each other <small>AND SINFUL</small> in adultery, <small>AGAINST THE LORD</small> in idolatry, <small>EXCEEDINGLY SO</small> in bloodshed. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said in the name of R. Johanan bar Nahman: When Amraphel and his associates came to fight with the Sodomites, because they had captured Lot, Abraham went out to fight against them. So he killed the kings, and they fled, just as it is written (in Gen. 14:10): <small>NOW THE VALLEY OF SIDDIM WAS FULL OF BITUMEN PITS; [AND THE KINGS OF SODOM &#x003C; AND GOMORRAH &#x003E; FLED] &#x003C; AND FELL THERE &#x003E;</small>. Abraham began reflecting: The kings came to fight with the Sodomites. So the kings fell, but those &#x003C; of Sodom and Gomorrah &#x003E; fled. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THOSE WHO REMAINED FLED TO THE MOUNTAIN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn388">36</xref></sup> Perhaps you will say: There were worthy ones among them. The Holy One said to him (in Job 20:24-26): <small>SHOULD HE FLEE FROM THE IRON WEAPON, &#x003C; THE BOW OF BRASS SHALL PASS THROUGH HIM &#x003E;; HE DRAWS IT OUT, AND IT COMES OUT OF HIS BODY &#x2026; UTTER DARKNESS IS LAID UP IN RESERVE FOR HIM; &#x003C; AN UNFANNED FIRE SHALL CONSUME HIM; IT SHALL BE BAD FOR A SURVIVOR IN HIS TENT &#x003E;. UTTER DARKNESS IS LAID UP</small> concerns Sodom, since it lies to the south<sup><xref rid="fn389">37</xref></sup> of the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 16:46): <small>AND YOUR YOUNGER SISTER [THAT DWELLS SOUTH OF YOU IS SODOM AND HER DAUGHTERS]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SHALL CONSUME THE SURVIVOR IN HIS TENT</small>? That, even if a single survivor is left &#x007B;of them&#x007D; [from there], the evil of evil <small>&#x003C; SHALL CONSUME THE SURVIVOR &#x003E; IN HIS TENT</small>. Which &#x003C; survivor &#x003E; ? This is Lot&#x2019;s wife, Edith, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 19:26): <small>BUT HIS WIFE LOOKED BACK, AND SHE BECAME A PILLAR OF SALT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn390">38</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.9 Genesis 18:17ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 18:15:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING&#x0021;</small> Let our master instruct us: Is it correct for someone to stand and pray &#x003C; the <italic>Amidah</italic> &#x003E; with frivolity? Thus have our masters taught (in Ber. 5:1):<sup><xref rid="fn391">39</xref></sup> <small>ONE STANDS TO PRAY &#x003C; THE <italic>AMIDAH</italic> &#x003E; ONLY WITH REVERENCE</small>. David said (in Ps. 2:11): <small>SERVE THE LORD WITH FEAR, AND REJOICE WITH TREMBLING</small>. There is a story about a certain person who stood &#x003C; for the <italic>Amidah</italic> &#x003E; with frivolity and supported himself against the wall, but R. Samuel bar Nahmani turned him back. He said that he should not behave with frivolity. And so you find with the ancestors of the world. When they prayed, they would pray with fear. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as Moses said (in Deut. 9:18, 25): <small>THEN I PROSTRATED MYSELF BEFORE THE LORD</small>, when he was seeking mercy for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:11): <small>BUT MOSES IMPLORED &#x003C; THE LORD HIS GOD &#x003E;</small>. He girded his loins in prayer [to speak in defense<sup><xref rid="fn392">40</xref></sup> of Israel]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, (according to Exod. 32:11-13) <small>WHY DOES YOUR WRATH BURN AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE&#x2026; ? WHY, O LORD, SHOULD THE EGYPTIANS SPEAK, &#x003C; SAYING: WITH EVIL INTENT HE BROUGHT THEM OUT TO KILL THEM IN THE MOUNTAINS &#x003E; &#x2026; ? REMEMBER YOUR SERVANTS, ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. Hezekiah bar Hiyya said: It was not pleasing to the Holy One until Moses mentioned the merit of the ancestors. The Holy One said to him: Moses, if they had not had the merit of the ancestors, I would have destroyed them. You do not know how to plead merit. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest in the name of R. Simon and R. Abbin in the name of R. Aha said: What did the Holy One do? He put on his prayer shawl, like the representative (<italic>shaliah</italic>) of a congregation [when he is passing] before the ark (i.e., leading the prayers), and said to Moses: Thus are you to pray to me and say (as in Exod. 34:6): <small>THE LORD, THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; This interpretation is suggested by the beginning of the verse &#x003E;, where it is stated: <small>THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE MOSES AND PROCLAIMED</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>PASSED</small>? &#x003C; That the Holy One <small>PASSED BEFORE MOSES</small> &#x003E; like &#x003C; a prayer leader &#x003E; passing before the ark. See how the righteous seek merit for the world and speak in defense<sup><xref rid="fn393">41</xref></sup> of Israel&#x0021; &#x003C; They pray &#x003E;, not only for Israel, but also for the wicked, since it is stated (in Ezek. 33:11): <small>AS I LIVE, SAYS [THE LORD] GOD, I DO NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF THE WICKED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn394">42</xref></sup> Why? Perhaps they may repent. You yourself know that it is so. When the Holy One desired to destroy those five cities, he consulted with Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 18:20): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: THE OUTCRY AGAINST SODOM AND GOMORRAH IS &#x003C; SO GREAT &#x003E;</small>. Abraham began to speak to the Lord in their defense: Think&#x0021; Perhaps they will repent. Where is it shown? Where they read on the matter (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING</small>&#x0021;</p>
<title>4.10 Genesis 18:17ff., Part V</title>
<p>It is written (in Job 41:4 [12]): <small>I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT ABOUT HIS BOASTINGS, HAUGHTY TALK, AND HIS FAIR ARRAY OF WORDS</small>. The Holy One said: Lest the children of Adam say: We also speak with the Holy One just as Abraham spoke, and he is keeping silent for us, the Holy One said: No, <small>I WILL NOT KEEP SILENT ABOUT HIS BOASTINGS</small>. Only for Abraham alone do I keep silent. Why? Because he kept silent for me, I also keep silent for him. When did Abraham keep silent? When I said to him (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED</small>, and afterwards I said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON &#x2026; &#x003C; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING &#x003E;</small>. Then he kept silent for me, as stated (in Ps. 38:14 [13]): <small>BUT I AM LIKE A DEAF PERSON, NOT HEARING, &#x003C; LIKE A DUMB PERSON, NOT OPENING HIS MOUTH &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn395">43</xref></sup> I also will keep silent for him; and, even though he said harsh things, as stated (in Job 41:4 [12]): <small>HAUGHTY TALK, HIS FAIR ARRAY OF WORDS</small> was pleasing to me. And what is the meaning of <small>HAUGHTY TALK</small>? See what is written (in Gen. 18:23): <small>THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID: WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY &#x003C; THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED &#x003E;</small>? Abraham said to the Holy One (in Gen. 18:25): Sovereign of the World, <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &#x003C; TO DO SUCH A THING &#x003E;</small>, for will not those coming into the world say: This is his trade, that he destroy the generations by a rule of cruelty. He destroyed the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion &#x003C; of humankind &#x003E;. He did not abandon his trade. [Thus, Abraham said] (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn396">44</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: You have said this. Come and see, as I make all the generations that I have destroyed pass before you. Then I will show you that I did not collect their divine punishment from them &#x003C; before it was finally sealed &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn397">45</xref></sup> Now, if it should cross your mind that I did not act fairly, teach me; and I will act &#x003C; accordingly &#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Job 34:32): <small>WHAT I DO NOT SEE, YOU TEACH ME. IF I HAVE DONE WRONG, I WILL NOT CONTINUE</small>. So I will continue no more. They said to him: Sovereign of the World, far be it from you to issue judgment over all creation. Thus it is stated (in Job 34:10): <small>LISTEN TO ME, THEREFORE, O PEOPLE OF UNDERSTANDING; MAY WICKEDNESS BE FAR FROM GOD AND INJUSTICE, FROM THE ALMIGHTY</small>. Rather (in vs. 11): <small>FOR HE REPAYS A PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS ACTIONS</small>&#x2026;. Therefore, he says (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &#x003C; TO DO SUCH A THING, TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED&#x0021; FAR BE IT FROM YOU &#x003E;</small>&#x0021;</p>
<title>4.11 Genesis 18:17ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation: What is the reason that he says two times (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>? Abraham said: <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small> to bring all creation to judgment either in this world or in the world to come. He therefore says: <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU&#x0021; FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>&#x0021;</p>
<title>4.12 Genesis 18:17ff., Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU&#x0021;</small> Abraham said: Sovereign of the World, I see through the Holy Spirit that a certain woman is going to deliver an entire town.<sup><xref rid="fn398">46</xref></sup> So am I not worthy to deliver these five cities? Which woman was that? That was Serah bat Asher, in the time that Sheba ben Bichri rebelled against David and came to Abel, as stated (in II Sam. 20:15): <small>[THEN THEY CAME AND BESIEGED HIM IN ABEL] &#x2026; AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH JOAB WERE DESTROYING THE WALL TO THROW IT DOWN</small>. When Serah perceived the situation, she began to cry out &#x003C; for Joab &#x003E;. They called Joab to her. When Joab came, she said (in vs. 17): <small>ARE YOU JOAB? AND HE SAID: YES</small>. You are a sage, since the Scripture praises you (in II Sam. 23:8) as <small>ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small> (i.e., in the academy)&#x2026;. <sup><xref rid="fn399">47</xref></sup> Have you not read in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY &#x003C; TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT &#x003E;</small> ? Thus, was it not up to you to do so? (II Sam. 20:18:) <small>&#x007B;YOU&#x007D; [THEY] USED TO SPEAK IN EARLY TIMES, SAYING: LET THEM SURELY ASK IN ABEL</small>. (Deut. 20:10f.:) <small>YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT (a hostile city). &#x003C; THEN IT SHALL BE, IF IT MAKES YOU AN ANSWER OF PEACE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (II Sam. 20:18f.:) <small>&#x003C; LET THEM SURELY ASK &#x003E; IN ABEL; AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE MATTER&#x2026;. SO WHY WOULD YOU DEVOUR THE LORD&#x2019;S HERITAGE</small>? When he heard that, Joab became afraid and said: There is a requirement here, as stated (in vs. 20): <small>&#x007B;THEN JOAB SAID:&#x007D; [THEN JOAB ANSWERED AND SAID: FAR BE IT], FAR BE IT</small><sup><xref rid="fn400">48</xref></sup> <small>FROM ME &#x003C; THAT I SHOULD DEVOUR &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. But you, since you are a merciful &#x003C; God &#x003E;, is it pleasing for you to destroy these? (Gen. 18:25:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING, &#x003C; TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE, SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED&#x0021; FAR BE IT FROM YOU &#x003E;</small> &#x0021; Now what did Joab say to her? (II Sam. 20:21:) <small>THE SITUATION IS NOT THE SAME, FOR A MAN FROM THE HILLS OF EPHRAIM NAMED SHEBA BEN BICHRI &#x003C; HAS RAISED HIS HAND AGAINST KING DAVID &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Sheba is a man with a blemish, one who serves idols. (II Sam. 20:1:) <small>NOW THERE HAPPENED TO BE THERE A MAN OF BELIAL WHOSE NAME IS SHEBA BEN BICHRI</small>. She said to him (in vs. 19): <small>I AM THE SHELUME (rt.: <italic>ShLM</italic>) OF THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn401">49</xref></sup> I am the one who completed (rt.: <italic>ShLM</italic>) the number of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 26:46): <small>AND THE NAME OF ASHER&#x2019;S DAUGHTER WAS SERAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn402">50</xref></sup> Just stay in your place, and I will make peace (rt.: <italic>ShLM</italic>). Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:21): <small>BEHOLD, HIS HEAD WILL BE THROWN TO YOU OVER THE WALL</small>. And so she had confidence in herself that she would deliver his head to Joab. But see what she did (according to vs. 22)&#x0021; <small>THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN HER WISDOM</small>? Simply that she said to them: Understand that Joab and all Israel are standing outside to kill us, our sons, and our daughters. They said to her: Why? She said to them: He would take a hundred people and go. They said to her: Let him take two hundred. She said to them: He only wants fifty people. They said to her: Let him take a hundred. She said to them: He only wants five: They said to her: Let him take ten. She said to them: He only wants one whose name is Sheba ben Bichri. When they heard that, they immediately went and cut off his head. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:22, cont.): <small>SO THEY CUT OFF THE HEAD OF SHEBA BEN BICHRI</small>. Look at the wisdom of this woman&#x0021; In the same way Abraham came in wisdom before the Holy One. He came &#x003C; down &#x003E; from fifty to forty, from forty to thirty, from thirty to twenty, and from twenty to ten. So also with this woman (according to II Sam. 20:22): <small>THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM</small>. Regarding her Solomon gave praise<sup><xref rid="fn403">51</xref></sup> (in Eccl. 9:18): <small>WISDOM IS BETTER THAN INSTRUMENTS OF WAR</small>. The wisdom of Serah was better than the instruments of war that were in the hands of Joab. When Joab received the head of Sheba ben Bichri, he immediately went back without touching the city. Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, now if Joab, when he took the head of one person who was guilty, left the city alone, would you, who are merciful, destroy everyone? (Gen. 18:25:) <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU</small>&#x0021;</p>
<title>4.13 Genesis 18:17ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>R. Judah b. R. Shallum said: What is the meaning of <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU (literally) FROM DOING &#x003C; SUCH A THING &#x003E;</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn404">52</xref></sup> &#x201C;To do&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>FROM DOING</small>, i.e., neither that nor anything like it.<sup><xref rid="fn405">53</xref></sup> The Divine Presence departed. The Holy One waited for &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; in case he should find &#x003C; some &#x003E; merit for them. When he did not find &#x003C; any &#x003E; for them, Abraham stood and prayed before the Holy One. (Gen. 18:33:) <small>SO THE LORD WENT AWAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED &#x003C; SPEAKING WITH ABRAHAM &#x003E;</small>. Immediately, on that very day, the angels entered Sodom, as stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.14 Genesis 19:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 19:1:) <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: How many &#x003C; methods for &#x003E; executions are given over to the court?<sup><xref rid="fn406">54</xref></sup> Four, and these are (according to <italic>Sanh</italic>. 7:1) <small>STONING, BURNING, BEHEADING, AND STRANGULATION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn407">55</xref></sup> And which is the most severe? Our masters have said: Stoning. R. Simeon ben Johay says: Burning, because it was inflicted on a priest&#x2019;s daughter who had committed adultery. See how serious sexual perversion is when &#x003C; it is punished &#x003E; by burning. R. &#x007B;Simeon&#x007D; [Joshua] ben Levi said in the name of Bar Qappara: The Holy One granted atonement for everything except sexual perversion, as stated (in Prov. 6:29): <small>NO ONE WHO TOUCHES HER WILL BE CLEANSED</small>. R. Joshua bar Nehemiah said: The Sodomites also were liable to fire because they had erupted into sexual perversion. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE</small>. When they were found guilty, the Holy One said to the angels: Why are you standing about? Go and destroy them. They immediately descended and carried out the <italic>keleusis</italic><sup><xref rid="fn408">56</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., the command&#x007D; of their Creator. Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM &#x003C; IN THE EVENING &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>4.15 Genesis 19:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 19:1:) <small>IN THE EVENING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE EVENING</small>? That the Sodomites were dark like the night.<sup><xref rid="fn409">57</xref></sup> Another interpretation: <small>IN THE EVENING (<italic>ba&#x2018;erev</italic>)</small>. The evening of Sodom had arrived.<sup><xref rid="fn410">58</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND LOT WAS SITTING AT THE GATE OF SODOM</small>, as he had learned from the practice of Abraham. What is written here (in Gen. 18:2) about Abraham? <small>WHEN HE SAW THEM HE RAN &#x003C; FROM &#x003E; THE DOOR OF HIS TENT TO MEET THEM &#x003C; AND BOWED DOWN TO THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>. Solomon has said in (Prov. 22:6): <small>TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO</small>. Because Lot had grown up in Abraham&#x2019;s house, he had acquired &#x003C; Abraham&#x2019;s &#x003E; moral standards. &#x003C; Thus &#x003E; (in Gen. 19:1, cont.): <small>AND HE BOWED DOWN WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND</small>. Just as Abraham had done, he brought them into his house. What is written (in vss. 4-5)? <small>BEFORE THEY LAY DOWN &#x2026; <small>AND THEY CALLED UNTO LOT &#x2026; &#x003C; BRING THEM OUT UNTO US THAT WE MAY KNOW THEM &#x003E;</small></small>. The angels began to be astonished, saying: The matter has reached us&#x0021; Now &#x003C; there is &#x003E; much on the subject &#x003C; that is being passed over &#x003E; merely in order not to bother you. What did they finally do? One of them rescued Lot, and one of them destroyed Sodom.<sup><xref rid="fn411">59</xref></sup> Now perhaps you will say: He destroyed it with one of his hands. No, &#x003C; it was &#x003E; merely with one finger, which is one of five on the hand. Thus it is stated (in Job 28:9): <small>HE PUT OUT HIS HAND <italic>BAHALLAMISH</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn412">60</xref></sup> In the world to come the Holy One will heal it (i.e., Sodom);<sup><xref rid="fn413">61</xref></sup> and Israel will divide it up, as stated (in Ps. 60:8ff. [6ff.]): <small>I WILL DISTRIBUTE SHECHEM &#x003C; AND MEASURE OUT THE VALLEY OF SUCCOTH&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn414">62</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.16 Genesis 19:24ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: When a court has ordained a fast for the community so that rains may come down, and they do come down on that day, is it correct for them to finish it? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ta&#x2018;an</italic>. 25b [bar.]):<sup><xref rid="fn415">63</xref></sup> <small>IF THEY WERE FASTING, AND THE RAINS CAME DOWN BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN, THEY SHALL NOT FINISH IT. AFTER THE RISING OF THE SUN THEY SHALL FINISH IT. &#x003C; THESE ARE &#x003E; THE WORDS OF R. ME&#x2019;IR, BUT R. JUDAH SAYS: BEFORE NOON THEY DO NOT COMPLETE IT; AFTER NOON THEY COMPLETE IT</small>. And where did the generations (i.e., the sages) find support that they should fast on Monday and Thursday? &#x003C; It is &#x003E; simply &#x003C; that &#x003E;, when Israel committed that act (i.e., of the golden calf), Moses went up &#x003C; onto the mountain &#x003E; on a Thursday and came down on a Monday. How is it shown? R. Levi said: He went up on a Thursday. Now from Thursday through &#x003C; the following &#x003E; Thursday to the Thursday &#x003C; after that &#x003E; there are fifteen &#x003C; days &#x003E;. And from Sabbath eve through &#x003C; the following &#x003E; Sabbath eve to the Sabbath eve &#x003C; after that &#x003E; there are fifteen &#x003C; days &#x003E;, for a total of thirty. Also from Sabbath to Sabbath there are eight &#x003C; days &#x003E;, for a total of thirty-eight. Then a Sunday and a Monday make forty &#x003C; days &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn416">64</xref></sup> Therefore, the sages have ruled that one should fast on Monday and on Thursday, on &#x003C; the day of &#x003E; Moses&#x2019; ascent and on &#x003C; that of &#x003E; his descent. Now at the end of forty days they fasted and wept before Moses, so that the Holy One was filled with mercy for them and appointed that day for them as a day of atoning for their sins. And this was the Day of Atonement, as stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU TO CLEANSE YOU</small>. See how lovely repentance (rt.: <italic>ShVB</italic>) is&#x0021; The Holy One said (in Mal. 3:7): <small>RETURN (rt.: <italic>ShVB</italic>) UNTO ME AND I WILL RETURN (rt.: <italic>ShVB</italic>) UNTO YOU</small>. For, if there are some sins on one&#x2019;s hand and that person returns to the Holy One, he credits him as if he had not sinned. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 18:22): <small>&#x003C; NOT &#x003E; ANY OF HIS SINS WHICH HE COMMITTED &#x003C; SHALL BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. But, when the Holy One has warned him a first time, and a second and a third, without him repenting, he exacts punishment from him, as stated (in Job 33:29): <small>BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS &#x003C; TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A PERSON &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. When he does not find pleasure in &#x003C; such a &#x003E; one, he immediately exacts punishment from him. You yourself know that it is so. When the Holy One desired to destroy Sodom and its people, Abraham stood and sought mercy for them. He thought that there might be hope for them, as stated (in Gen. 18:23): <small>THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID: &#x003C; WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED &#x003E;</small> ? What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn417">65</xref></sup> R. Joshua says: <small>DREW NEAR</small> is nothing but an expression relating to battle, as when it is stated (in II Sam. 10:13): <small>SO JOAB AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR TO THE BATTLE</small>. R. Nehemiah says: It is nothing but an expression relating to prayer, as when it is stated (in I Kings 18:36): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN IT WAS TIME TO PRESENT THE MEAL OFFERING, THE PROPHET ELIJAH DREW NEAR</small>&#x2026;. But the sages say: <small>DREW NEAR</small> is nothing but an expression of entreaty, as when it is stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM AND SAID: &#x003C; PRAY, MY LORD, PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Abraham said to the Holy One (in Gen. 18:25): <small>FAR BE IT FROM YOU &#x003C; TO DO SUCH A THING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And he sought mercy for them until (in vss. 26-33) &#x003C; his request &#x003E; went down from fifty to ten. When he found no merit for them, the Divine Presence departed from him, as stated (in vs. 33): <small>THEN THE LORD WENT AWAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED</small>&#x2026;. Immediately the retribution came upon them. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what we read on the matter] (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>4.17 Genesis 19:24ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 58:9 [8]): <small>LET THEM BE LIKE A SNAIL (<italic>ShBLWL</italic>),&#x003C; WHICH DISSOLVES AND GOES AWAY; LIKE A WOMAN&#x2019;S STILLBIRTH, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE SUN &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn418">66</xref></sup> [Just as a flood stream (<italic>ShBLT</italic>) is swept away, so were the people of Sodom swept away. <small>WHICH DISSOLVES AND GOES AWAY</small>], in that the Holy One dissolved them in fire. <small>LIKE A WOMAN&#x2019;S STILLBIRTH, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THE SUN</small>, in that the people of Sodom did not see &#x003C; it any more &#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 19:23): <small>THE SUN HAD RISEN OVER THE EARTH &#x003C; WHEN LOT CAME TO ZOHAR &#x003E;</small>. What &#x003C; else &#x003E; is written there (in vs. 24)? <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 58:9 [8]): What is the meaning of <small>LIKE A SNAIL (<italic>ShBLWL</italic>)</small>? Just as a flood stream (<italic>ShBLT</italic>) sweeps away whatever it comes upon, so it is with a rioter<sup><xref rid="fn419">67</xref></sup> who rises up in a region. Anyone who is found with him is swept away with him. Thus it is stated: <small>LIKE A SNAIL (<italic>ShBLWL</italic>)</small>. And when he is dead, he no longer sees the sun (cf. ibid., cont.)<sup><xref rid="fn420">68</xref></sup> Why? Because he was a rioter.</p>
<title>4.18 Genesis 19:24ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 11:6): <small>UPON THE WICKED HE SHALL RAIN COALS; FIRE, BRIMSTONE, AND BURNING WIND SHALL BE THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. This portion was prepared before the world was created, as stated (ibid.): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>? (Ps. 75:9:) <small>FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP FOAMING WITH WINE, FULL OF MIXED WINE; AND OUT OF THIS HE POURS. &#x003C; AS FOR ITS DREGS, SURELY ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH SHALL DRAIN THEM OUT AND DRINK THEM. &#x003E; FOR IN THE HAND OF THE LORD THERE IS A CUP</small>&#x2026;. Lest you say that it was not full, the text says: <small>FULL OF MIXED WINE</small>. Lest you say: They did not drink from it, the text says: <small>OUT OF THIS HE POURS. AS FOR ITS DREGS, SURELY ALL THE WICKED OF THE EARTH SHALL DRAIN THEM OUT AND DRINK THEM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>. From that cup they drank, as stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>THE PORTION OF THEIR CUP</small>.</p>
<p>(Ibid.:) <small>UPON THE WICKED HE SHALL RAIN COALS</small>. R. Hanina ben Pazzi said:<sup><xref rid="fn421">69</xref></sup> The Holy One does not send down anything bad from above, only rain; and it &#x003C; then &#x003E; becomes brimstone.</p>
<title>4.19 Genesis 19:24ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FROM THE LORD</small>? It says (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>, while here (in Gen. 19:24) it says: <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. R. Berekhyah said: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn422">70</xref></sup> To a king who was standing at a baker&#x2019;s oven. &#x003C; When &#x003E; his friend came in to him, he took out a piece of hot bread &#x003C; and &#x003E; gave it to him. &#x003C; When &#x003E; his enemy came in to him, he took up burning coals &#x003C; and &#x003E; gave them to him. So &#x003C; it is with &#x003E; the Holy One. When Israel came unto the desert, he brought down bread from the heavens for them, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. But when the Sodomites came to the point of transgressions, he brought down fire from the heavens for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND THE LORD</small>? That he sat over them with the authority of a court<sup><xref rid="fn423">71</xref></sup> of seventy-one,<sup><xref rid="fn424">72</xref></sup> found them guilty, and brought down fire upon them. So they went forth to &#x003C; an execution by &#x003E; burning, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>&#x003C; FIRE &#x003E; FROM THE LORD</small>. In a similar way you say on the matter &#x003C; at hand &#x003E;: <small>AND THE LORD&#x2026; FROM THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn425">73</xref></sup> If someone comes to ask you &#x003C; about &#x003E; what is written in this verse: <small>AND THE LORD &#x2026; FROM THE LORD</small>, say to him: There are similar cases &#x003C; of redundancy &#x003E; in &#x003C; other &#x003E; verses. (I Kings 1:33:) <small>AND &#x007B;HE&#x007D; [THE KING] SAID &#x007B;UNTO HIS SERVANTS&#x007D; [TO THEM]: TAKE WITH YOU THE SLAVES OF YOUR LORD</small>. It was only necessary to say: &#x201C;My servants.&#x201D; And where &#x003C; is an example found &#x003E; in the Torah? (In Gen. 4:23:) <small>AND LAMECH SAID TO HIS WIVES: ADAH AND ZILLAH, HEAR MY VOICE; O WIVES OF LAMECH</small>. It was only necessary to say: &#x201C;My wives.&#x201D; So much for the Torah, but where &#x003C; is an example found &#x003E; in the Writings? Where it is stated (in Esth. 8:8): <small>FOR A WRITING WHICH IS WRITTEN IN THE KING&#x2019;S NAME AND SEALED WITH THE KING&#x2019;S SEAL</small>. It was only necessary to say: &#x201C;With my seal.&#x201D; So also here (in Gen. 19:24): <small>AND THE LORD RAINED DOWN &#x2026; FROM THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>4.20 Genesis 19:24ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 19:24:) <small>FROM THE LORD</small>. What is written before the verse (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn426">74</xref></sup> Elsewhere (in Gen. 18:2) three came to Abraham, as stated: <small>WHEN HE RAISED HIS EYES, HE LOOKED, AND BEHOLD, THREE PERSONS</small>. But here there are two, as stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME</small>. It is simply that the Holy One sent three angels, each one individually to perform his &#x003C; own particular &#x003E; mission. One went to bring good tidings to Sarah, one went to save Lot, and one went to destroy Sodom. An angel does not perform two missions, [nor do two angels perform one mission]. Michael went to bring good tidings to Sarah. &#x201C;Surely we will return unto you&#x201D; is not written here (in Gen. 18:14), but <small>I WILL RETURN</small>. He performed his mission and went away. Then the &#x003C; other &#x003E; two went to perform their missions, as stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM IN THE EVENING</small>. Elsewhere (in 18:2, 16, 19:5f.) &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; has called them &#x201C;persons,&#x201D; but here it has called them &#x201C;angels.&#x201D; R. Alexandri, however, has said: &#x003C; When angels were &#x003E; near Abraham, they were &#x003C; called &#x003E; humans because angels were common in the house of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn427">75</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 31:27): <small>SHE OVERSEES THE ACTIVITIES (rt.: <italic>HLK</italic>) OF HER HOUSE</small>. Since those who went (rt.: <italic>HLK</italic>) to the house of Abraham were angels and because he was commonly among angels, they appeared to him in human form.<sup><xref rid="fn428">76</xref></sup> But for Lot, who was ignorant<sup><xref rid="fn429">77</xref></sup> &#x003C; about them &#x003E;, they appeared as angels. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.21 Genesis 19:24ff., Part VI</title>
<p>It is written (in Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn430">78</xref></sup> R. Papias interpreted: Because he stands alone in his world, there is no one to interfere with him. Whatever he wants, he does. R. Aqiva said to him: Enough from you, Papias&#x0021; One does not &#x003C; so &#x003E; interpret here. Rather, he does everything according to the Law. What is the meaning of <small>HAS ONENESS</small>? &#x003C; That &#x003E;, just as the petitioner petitions &#x003C; here &#x003E; below, so &#x003C; it is &#x003E; above. Just as the Sanhedrin conducts proceedings below, so &#x003C; it is &#x003E; above, as stated (in I Kings 22:19): <small>I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left &#x007B;and right&#x007D; above? And has it not already been stated (in Exod. 15:6): <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND, O LORD, GLORIOUS IN POWER, &#x003C; YOUR RIGHT HAND SHATTERS THE ENEMY &#x003E;</small> ? It is simply that the ones &#x003C; on the right &#x003E; tip the balance toward the side of merit, and the ones &#x003C; on the left &#x003E; tip the balance toward the side of guilt. Ergo, everything &#x003C; proceeds &#x003E; with justice. And, just as one who is a petitioner petitions &#x003C; here &#x003E; below, so &#x003C; it is &#x003E; above. Where is it shown? Where Daniel has said so (in Dan. 4:14 [17]): <small>THE RULING IS BY THE DECREE OF THE WATCHERS, AND THE PETITION &#x007B;BY&#x007D; THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONES</small>. Now you say: Because he stands alone in his world, he does whatever he wants&#x0021; What is the meaning of <small>HAS ONENESS</small> (in Job 23:13)? R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Because he alone in his world knows justice for his creatures. [R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite &#x003C; said &#x003E;: Because he alone in the world knows the temperament of his creatures.] The one to whom he says: Go on my mission, goes. Hence it says (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. So also Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 1:6): <small>I AM &#x003C; BUT &#x003E; A LAD</small>. The Holy One said to him: <small>DO NOT SAY: I AM &#x003C; BUT &#x003E; A LAD</small>. So also with Sodom, he conducted the proceedings in their court and saw that their guilt merited destruction. Then after that he sent them (the angels) to destroy them. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME TO SODOM</small>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere (in 18:2, 16, 19:5f.) &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; calls them &#x201C;persons,&#x201D; but here it calls them &#x201C;angels.&#x201D; To what is the matter comparable? To someone who received a dominion from the king. All the days that he was traveling on the road, he traveled as a <italic>paganus</italic> &#x007B;i.e. alone&#x007D; <sup><xref rid="fn431">79</xref></sup> &#x007B;He did not do otherwise.&#x007D; When he arrived to take his place, his tax collectors and the natives of the region began honoring him. So &#x003C; it was with &#x003E; the angels when they came to destroy the region. Before they entered Sodom, they traveled like humans. After they came to Sodom, it is written (in Gen. 19:1): <small>THEN THE TWO ANGELS CAME</small>. Did they depart from Abraham&#x2019;s place at noon and come to Sodom &#x003C; only &#x003E; in the evening?<sup><xref rid="fn432">80</xref></sup> It is simply that they were angels of mercy and had waited for the possibility that Abraham might plead &#x003C; some &#x003E; merit on their account so that &#x003C; the city &#x003E; would not be destroyed. For that reason they had waited until the evening.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 19:1): Why <small>IN THE EVENING</small>? Because the deeds of the Sodomites were dark like evening and night.<sup><xref rid="fn433">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 19:1:) <small>AND LOT WAS SITTING AT THE GATE OF SODOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn434">82</xref></sup> The written text has <small>SAT</small> (with a vowel letter missing from the Hebrew). There were five judges in Sodom. Now Lot was inferior to all of them, but they had him sit among them, for such is the written text: <small>AND LOT SAT AT THE GATE OF SODOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn435">83</xref></sup> (Prov. 22:6:) <small>TRAIN A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO</small>. Since &#x003C; Lot &#x003E; had grown up in Abraham&#x2019;s house and had seen him receive travelers, he had learned from him. He therefore brought the angels home with him. What is written there (in Gen. 19:4)? <small>BEFORE THEY HAD LAIN DOWN, &#x003C; THE MEN OF THE CITY, THE MEN OF SODOM, HAD SURROUNDED THE HOUSE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The angels began to be astonished, saying: This matter has reached even us&#x0021; Lot said to the angels: What have you come here to do? They said to him (in Gen. 19:13): <small>FOR WE ARE DESTROYING &#x003C; THIS PLACE &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn436">84</xref></sup> They revealed their <italic>mysterion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn437">85</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., secret&#x007D; to him. For that reason they were banished one hundred and thirty-eight years from their precincts. R. Tanhuma said one hundred and thirty years according to the number of the sacred ladder &#x003C; as reckoned &#x003E; by gematria.<sup><xref rid="fn438">86</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.22 Genesis 19:24ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 19:5:) <small>AND THEY CALLED UNTO LOT &#x003C; AND SAID TO HIM: WHERE ARE THE MEN &#x003E; &#x2026; THAT WE MAY KNOW THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn439">87</xref></sup> &#x003C; They did so &#x003E; because they desired to rape them. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: From here you learn that they were lecherous. He said to them (in vs. 8): <small>LOOK HERE, I HAVE TWO DAUGHTERS WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN ANYONE</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; teaches that he wanted to bring them into the midst of his house, but that his wife would not let him. What did he do? He brought them to his own part of the house.<sup><xref rid="fn440">88</xref></sup> (Gen. 19:11:) <small>SO THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND THE DOOR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn441">89</xref></sup> When &#x003C; the angels &#x003E; saw that the &#x003C; Sodomites &#x003E; deserved destruction, they also rescued Lot. What is written there (in Gen. 19:23-25)? <small>THE SUN HAD RISEN UPON THE EARTH &#x2026; THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES</small>. Perhaps you will say: He destroyed it with his five fingers.<sup><xref rid="fn442">90</xref></sup> R. Ayyevu said: &#x003C; It was &#x003E; with one of his fingers &#x003C; that &#x003E; he destroyed the cities of Sodom, as stated (in Job 28:9): <small>HE PUT OUT HIS HAND <italic>BAHALLAMISH</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn443">91</xref></sup> In the world to come, when the Holy One heals Israel, he will heal her, as stated (in Hos. 2:17 [15]): <small>I WILL GIVE &#x003C; ISRAEL &#x003E; HER VINEYARDS FROM THERE. HER VINEYARDS</small>: These are the prophets. (Ibid.:) <small>THE VALLEY OF ACHOR (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>KR</italic>) IS WITH A DOOR OF HOPE</small>. &#x003C; This means &#x003E;: A valley which I afflicted (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>KR</italic>) with my wrath <small>IS WITH A DOOR OF HOPE</small>. At that time they will voice a song, as stated (in ibid., cont.): <small>AND SHE WILL RESPOND (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>NH</italic>) FROM THERE AS IN THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH</small>; and one does not use <small>RESPOND (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>NH</italic>)</small> except in reference to song. Thus one finds stated (in Ps. 147:7): <small>SING (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>NH</italic>) TO THE LORD WITH THANKSGIVING</small>.</p>
<title>4.23 Genesis 20:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 20:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE TO THE LAND OF THE NEGEV</small>. This text is related (to Job 14:18): <small>AND YET A FALLING MOUNTAIN WILL CRUMBLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn444">92</xref></sup> This is Sodom and its companion cities, as stated (in Gen. 19:23f.): <small>THE SUN HAD RISEN UPON THE EARTH&#x2026;. THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN &#x003C; UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &#x2026; AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES &#x003E;</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: Woe to those wicked people because they cause a place of mercy to become a place of retribution. Wherefore, note how David gives praise<sup><xref rid="fn445">93</xref></sup> (in Ps. 148:1, 7f.): <small>HALLELUJAH&#x0021; PRAISE THE LORD FROM THE HEAVENS&#x2026;. &#x003C; PRAISE THE LORD &#x2026; FIRE AND HAIL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. But there is no fire there &#x003C; in the heavens &#x003E;, no hail, and no brimstone. Our colleague R. Ariste (citing Ps. 96:6) said: <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY ARE BEFORE HIM</small>. Where is there a place for retribution? From on earth, as stated (in Ps. 148:7) <small>PRAISE THE LORD FROM THE EARTH, YOU SEA MONSTERS AND ALL OCEAN DEEPS</small>. Ergo: &#x003C; Retribution is &#x003E; <small>FROM THE EARTH</small>. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; how can it be written (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN &#x2026; &#x003C; FROM THE LORD OUT OF THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small> ? Simply to teach you &#x003C; this &#x003E;: From the beginning when they were created, the Holy One gave a decree concerning them and said to them: In accordance with how you shall see the creatures, so let it be done to them.<sup><xref rid="fn446">94</xref></sup> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a caldron<sup><xref rid="fn447">95</xref></sup> of gold. &#x003C; Whoever &#x003E; wanted warm water would find &#x003C; some &#x003E; within it. &#x003C; Whoever &#x003E; wanted it cold would take &#x003C; some &#x003E; out of it. &#x003C; Whoever &#x003E; wanted burning coals would take &#x003C; some &#x003E; out of it. So &#x003C; also &#x003E; the Holy One said to the heavens: Whatever you see, do. For the Sodomites and the children of Esau there would be brimstone and fire; for Israel, dew. Thus it is stated (in Micah 5:6 [7]): <small>THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES, LIKE DEW</small>. The Holy One said: What need do I have for these people? He immediately destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25): <small>AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES</small>&#x2026;. Ergo, it says (in Job 14:18): <small>AND YET A FALLING MOUNTAIN WILL CRUMBLE, AND THE ROCK IS REMOVED FROM ITS PLACE</small>. Now there is no rock but Abraham, as stated (in Is. 51:1f.): <small>LOOK UNTO THE ROCK FROM WHICH YOU WERE HEWN &#x2026; &#x003C; LOOK UNTO ABRAHAM &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; He is the one &#x003E; who journeyed from his place, as stated (in Gen. 20:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE &#x003C; TO THE LAND OF THE NEGEV &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.24 Genesis 20:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 20:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 26:4f.): <small>I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE&#x2026; I HAVE HATED THE COMMUNITY OF EVILDOERS, &#x003C; AND WILL NOT DWELL WITH THE WICKED &#x003E;. I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE</small>. These are the people of the Tower &#x003C; of Babel &#x003E;, who were &#x003C; in fact &#x003E; false people. They went and said to Abraham: Come and dwell with us, since you are a valiant man, for we see that the Holy One has made his dwelling above and left us below. The Holy Spirit, however, cries out (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. You could not dwell in security even for one hour. (Ps. 82:5:) <small>THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN, AND THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND; THEY WILL WALK ABOUT IN DARKNESS. THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN</small>. This is the generation of Enosh<sup><xref rid="fn448">96</xref></sup> <small>AND THEY WILL NOT UNDERSTAND</small>. [This is] the generation of the flood. <small>THEY WILL WALK ABOUT IN DARKNESS</small>. This is the generation of the Tower &#x003C; of Babel &#x003E;. Abraham said to them: What are you seeking from the Holy One who dwells above? Has he perhaps said to you: Come, labor and provide<sup><xref rid="fn449">97</xref></sup> for me? He creates, and he provides; he makes, and he sustains. What do you want from him? (Gen. 11:4:) <small>&#x007B;THEY SAID TO HIM&#x007D; [THEN THEY SAID]: COME, LET US BUILD FOR OURSELVES A CITY AND A TOWER</small>. Then let us place our idols above him and make war with him. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LET US MAKE A NAME (i.e., a god) FOR OURSELVES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn450">98</xref></sup> Thus it is &#x003C; also &#x003E; written (in Exod. 23:13): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MENTION THE NAME OF OTHER GODS</small>. Abraham said to them: What are all these for? They said to him: Lest he do to us something like what he did to earlier generations. He said to them: You have forsaken (what Prov. 18:10 calls) <small>A TOWER OF STRENGTH, THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>; yet you say: <small>AND LET US MAKE A NAME (i.e., a god) FOR OURSELVES&#x0021;</small> What did the Holy One do? He dispersed them, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>. Now to what extent had they built and ascended the Tower? The Holy One was deriding them, as stated (in Ps. 2:4): <small>THE ONE WHO DWELLS IN THE HEAVENS WILL LAUGH; &#x003C; THE LORD WILL DERIDE THEM &#x003E;</small>. When they had gone up above on the Tower, &#x003C; there follows &#x003E; immediately (in vs. 5): <small>THEN HE WILL SPEAK UNTO THEM IN HIS WRATH</small>&#x2026;. So it (the Tower) fell from on high, as stated (in Ps. 5:11 [10]): <small>CONDEMN THEM, O GOD, LET THEM FALL BY THEIR OWN COUNSELS</small>. Thus Abraham had no dealings with them. Then the Holy One looked down upon them and saw them, as stated (in Ps. 53: 3f. [2f.]): <small>&#x007B;THE LORD&#x007D; [GOD] OF HEAVEN LOOKED DOWN UPON THE CHILDREN OF ADAM &#x2026; ALL OF THEM ARE DROSS</small>&#x2026;. When they became dross, they made themselves deities. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THERE IS NONE WHO DOES GOOD, NOT EVEN ONE</small>. From here you learn that Abraham was not one of them. The <small>ONE</small> mentioned here is none but Abraham, as stated (in Ezek. 33:24): <small>ABRAHAM WAS ONE AND HE INHERITED THE LAND</small>. Abraham began saying (in Ps. 26:4f.): <small>I HAVE NOT DWELT WITH FALSE PEOPLE; I HAVE HATED THE COMMUNITY OF EVILDOERS</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 20:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>.</p>

<p>(Gen. 20:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM JOURNEYED FROM THERE</small>. It is written (in Prov. 27:10): <small>&#x003C; DO NOT FORSAKE &#x003E; YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S FRIEND &#x2026; &#x003C; A CLOSE NEIGHBOR IS BETTER THAN A DISTANT BROTHER &#x003E;</small>. This &#x003C; verse refers to &#x003E; Hanun ben Nahash, king of the children of Ammon, as mentioned (in II Sam. 10:1f.): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THAT THAT &#x007B;NAHASH&#x007D; THE KING OF THE CHILDREN OF AMMON, DIED; &#x003C; AND HIS SON HANUN REIGNED IN HIS STEAD. &#x003E; THEN DAVID SAID: I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>. R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Pedat: And how did Nahash deal faithfully with David, since he had said (ibid., cont.), <small>AS HIS FATHER DEALT FAITHFULLY WITH ME</small>? Simply &#x003C; like this &#x003E;: When David fled from Saul, David and all his father&#x2019;s house went to Moab. He said to them: Receive my father, as stated (in I Sam. 22:4): <small>SO HE BROUGHT &#x003C; HIS PARENTS &#x003E; BEFORE THE KING OF MOAB</small>. (I Sam. 22:3:) <small>AND HE SAID [UNTO THE KING OF MOAB]: PLEASE LET MY FATHER AND MY MOTHER &#x007B;DWELL&#x007D; [GO AWAY] &#x003C; WITH YOU &#x003E;</small>. So he received them. When David went away, the king of Moab arose and killed the father, mother, and brothers of David. Only one of them survived, as &#x003C; only one &#x003E; is mentioned &#x003C; in David&#x2019;s census &#x003E; (in I Chron. 27:18): <small>BELONGING TO JUDAH &#x003C; THERE WAS &#x003E; ELIHU, ONE OF DAVID&#x2019;S BROTHERS</small>. R.Levi bar Halafta the Priest said that only one of them survived. And how was Elihu saved? He simply fled from the king of Moab and came to Nahash, king of Ammon, who received him. The king of Moab sent and said to Nahash: Did, perhaps, one of David&#x2019;s brothers come to you? He said to him: No; and he kept him until David came. For that reason David said (in II Sam. 10:2): <small>I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>. When David&#x2019;s representatives<sup><xref rid="fn451">99</xref></sup> came to Hanun, the princes of the children of Ammon said to him (in I Sam. 10:3): What is this? <small>DO YOU THINK THAT DAVID IS HONORING YOUR FATHER &#x003C; JUST &#x003E; BECAUSE DAVID SENT COMFORTERS TO YOU</small>? Do not trust David. Why? Because the Holy One has warned him about us. It is written &#x007B;for him&#x007D; in his Law (in Deut. 23:4): <small>NO AMMONITE OR MOABITE SHALL COME INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 23:7): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE AND BENEFIT</small>. Thus the Holy One has warned him. So will he despise the words of his God, and say (in II Sam. 10:2): <small>I WILL DEAL FAITHFULLY WITH HANUN BEN NAHASH</small>? (Ibid., vs. 3:) <small>IS IT NOT IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE THE CITY</small>? Immediately (in vs. 4) <small>HANUN TOOK THE SERVANTS OF DAVID AND SHAVED OFF &#x003C; HALF OF THEIR BEARDS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 27:10): <small>&#x003C; DO NOT FORSAKE &#x003E; YOUR FRIEND AND YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S FRIEND</small>&#x2026;. And so it was with Jehoram ben Jehoshaphat. When he became king, he killed all his brothers, as stated (in II Chron. 21:4): <small>WHEN JEHORAM HAD RISEN UP OVER THE KINGDOM OF HIS FATHER, HE CONSOLIDATED HIS POWER AND KILLED ALL HIS BROTHERS &#x007B;AND HIS FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE&#x007D;</small>.</p>
<p>What is the meaning (of Prov. 27:10): <small>A CLOSE NEIGHBOR IS BETTER THAN A DISTANT BROTHER</small>? The Holy One said to Abimelech ben Jerubbaal (of Jud. 9): King Abimelech of the Philistines is better than you because he gave a lot of honor to Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 20:15): <small>THEN ABIMELECH SAID: HERE BEFORE YOU IS MY LAND</small>. Why did he say this? It is simply that he saw all the honor with which the Holy One had honored him, as stated (in Gen. 20:3): <small>BUT GOD CAME UNTO ABIMELECH IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>. He said to him (ibid.): You fool&#x0021; <small>HERE YOU ARE TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE WOMAN WHOM YOU HAVE TAKEN</small>. You have all this happiness at hand, and you are dying on account of a woman&#x0021; Did you not consider that (in ibid., cont.) <small>SHE IS A MARRIED WOMAN (lit.: A HUSBAND&#x2019;S WIFE)</small>? What is the meaning of this <small>HUSBAND&#x2019;S (<italic>ba&#x2018;al</italic>, rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;L</italic>) WIFE (<italic>be&#x2018;ulah</italic>, rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;L</italic>)</small>? &#x007B;Is it not&#x007D; [simply that] she is the mistress (<italic>ba&#x2018;alah</italic>, rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;L</italic>) of a &#x007B;mistress&#x007D; [husband] (<italic>ba&#x2018;al</italic>, rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;L</italic>)?</p>
<p>(Gen. 20:4:) <small>NOW ABIMELECH HAD NOT APPROACHED &#x003C; HER &#x003E;</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, everyone is equal before you. Job has said (in Job 9:22): <small>IT IS ALL ONE &#x2026; HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. (Gen. 20:4:) <small>WOULD YOU SLAY EVEN THE RIGHTEOUS GENTILE</small>? In the case of the Sodomites, when they had not sinned before you, would you have destroyed them? So with me, when I have not sinned before you, would you slay me? (Gen. 20:4f.:) <small>WOULD YOU SLAY EVEN THE RIGHTEOUS? DID HE NOT SAY TO ME: SHE IS MY SISTER?&#x2026; I DID THIS WITH AN INNOCENT HEART AND CLEAN HANDS</small>. Moreover, I did not believe it until I had asked her (in vs. 5, cont.), <small>BUT EVEN SHE HERSELF SAID: HE IS MY BROTHER</small>. Still I did not believe it until I had asked her donkey and camel drivers, and they said: She is his sister.<sup><xref rid="fn452">100</xref></sup> (Gen. 20:6:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO HIM IN THE DREAM: I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE THIS WITH AN INNOCENT HEART</small>. The Holy One said: In one way you are blameless, but in one way you have lied. Your innocent heart is here (in this text); your clean hands are not here. You know that this is so. &#x201C;With clean hands&#x201D; is not what is written here but <small>WITH AN INNOCENT HEART</small>. The Holy One said to him. You have desired to sin against me, <small>BUT I, EVEN I, SAVED YOU FROM SINNING AGAINST ME</small>. They said about this <small>ABIMELECH</small> that he was proper in that he did not touch her. Our masters have said: It was good for him that it is so written (in Gen. 20:4): <small>NOW ABIMELECH HAD NOT APPROACHED HER</small>. Abimelech said: Sovereign of the World, to be sure, you are persuaded<sup><xref rid="fn453">101</xref></sup> that I did not touch her. Who will persuade her husband that I did not touch her?<sup><xref rid="fn454">102</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: What do you care about persuasion?<sup><xref rid="fn455">103</xref></sup> He knows. Why? Because he is a prophet, as stated (in Gen. 20:7): <small>SO NOW, RESTORE THE MAN&#x2019;S WIFE, FOR HE IS A PROPHET</small>. If he prays for you, you shall live; (ibid.): <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT RESTORE HER, KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DIE</small>. Blessed are the righteous, for so the Holy One glorifies them.</p>
<title>4.26 Genesis 20:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 20:8:) <small>THEN ABIMELECH AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>&#x2026;. Having observed the morning, when would he arise? Immediately (ibid.), <small>HE AROSE AND CALLED ALL HIS SERVANTS</small>. He said to them: The Holy One said thus and so to me in a dream at night. They said to him: Do not be afraid. Dreams speak empty talk; so would you be afraid of dreams? When they had said this to him, the Holy One said to him (in vs. 7): <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT RESTORE HER, KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DIE</small>. (Gen. 8f.:) <small>SO THE MEN WERE VERY AFRAID. THEN ABIMELECH CALLED ABRAHAM</small>. Abraham said to Abimelech (in vss. 11f.): <small>BECAUSE I SAID: SURELY THE FEAR OF GOD IS NOT IN THIS PLACE &#x2026; AND MOREOVER SHE IS INDEED MY SISTER, MY FATHER&#x2019;S DAUGHTER, BUT NOT THE DAUGHTER OF MY MOTHER</small>. Hence they have said: A gentile star worshiper has no father.<sup><xref rid="fn456">104</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.27 Genesis 20:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 20:14:) <small>THEN ABIMELECH TOOK &#x003C; SHEEP AND OXEN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. He said to Abraham (in vs. 15): <small>HERE, MY LAND IS BEFORE YOU. &#x003C; DWELL WHEREVER YOU PLEASE &#x003E;</small>. See the honor with which he honored Abraham&#x0021; And not only him, but Sarah as well. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in vs. 16): <small>AND TO SARAH HE SAID: LOOK, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND PIECES OF SILVER; &#x003C; LOOK, THIS BELONGS TO YOU AS A COVERING OF THE EYES &#x003E;</small> <sup><xref rid="fn457">105</xref></sup> <small>BEFORE ALL WHO ARE WITH YOU</small>&#x2026;. R. Aha said: What is the meaning of <small>LOOK, THIS BELONGS TO YOU AS A COVERING OF THE EYES</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn458">106</xref></sup> He took a royal garment, put it on her, and made her a noblewoman.<sup><xref rid="fn459">107</xref></sup> Why? So that no one in the world would woo her; rather they would hear that she was a queen and be afraid to woo her.</p>
<title>4.28 Genesis 20:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>The Holy One said to Abimelech ben Gideon (of Jud. 9): O wicked one, see the honor that Abimelech paid to Abraham&#x0021; Now you have arisen and killed your brothers, (according to vs. 5): <small>SEVENTY MEN ON ONE STONE</small>. Woe to that man, for thus Solomon has spoken (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO DIGS A PIT WILL FALL INTO IT</small>. Accordingly, he also was not killed other than by means of a stone, as stated (in vs. 53): <small>THEN A CERTAIN WOMAN CAST A MILLSTONE &#x003C; UPON ABIMELECH&#x2019;S HEAD AND BROKE HIS SKULL &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to him: I have written in my Torah (in Prov. 10:27): <small>THE FEAR OF THE LORD INCREASES ONE&#x2019;S DAYS, BUT THE YEARS OF THE WICKED WILL BE SHORTENED</small>. Now you have killed your brothers. By your life, I am shortening the years of that man (i.e., Abimelech). He therefore only reigned three years, as stated (in Jud. 9:22): <small>NOW ABIMELECH RULED OVER ISRAEL THREE YEARS</small>.</p>
<title>4.29 Genesis 20:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Prov. 18:12:) <small>A PERSON&#x2019;S HEART IS HAUGHTY BEFORE DESTRUCTION</small>. This person was Abimelech, who was not destroyed until he had exalted himself and killed his brothers. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HUMILITY GOES BEFORE HONOR</small>. This was his father, Gideon; for when they said to him (in Jud. 8:22): <small>RULE OVER US, YOU, [YOUR SON, AND YOUR SON&#x2019;S SON AS WELL</small>], he said to them (in vs. 23): <small>I WILL NOT RULE OVER YOU MYSELF, [NOR SHALL MY SON RULE OVER YOU; THE LORD SHALL RULE OVER YOU]</small>. They said three things to him, and he said three things to them. The Holy One said to him: You say this. By your life, I am raising up from you a son who will reign three years corresponding to the three things that you said. Ergo (in Prov. 18; 12): <small>AND HUMILITY GOES BEFORE HONOR</small>. Therefore (in Jud. 9:22): <small>NOW ABIMELECH RULED [OVER ISRAEL THREE YEARS]</small>.</p>
<p>(Jud. 9:23:) <small>THEN GOD SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT &#x003C; BETWEEN ABIMELECH AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM &#x003E;</small>. Also at the end &#x003C; of the story &#x003E; it is written (in vs. 57): <small>AND UPON THEM CAME THE CURSE OF JOTHAM BEN JERUBBAAL</small>. What is written there (in vs. 7)? <small>BUT, WHEN THEY TOLD JOTHAM</small> (about the Shechemites making Abimelech their king), <small>[HE WENT AND STOOD AT THE TOP OF MOUNT GERIZIM]</small>. Now why did he stand at the top of Mount Gerizim for cursing, when (according to Deut. 27:13-26) they only gave curses on Mount Ebal? It is simply that Jotham said this: The Samaritans are going to say: Mount Gerizim is ours because there were the blessings given; but they will not know that curses are given there. How is that? It is simply this: The ones who were standing on Mount Ebal and cursing, at whom were they cursing? Was it not at those who were standing opposite them (on Gerizim)? The ones who were blessing, at whom were they blessing? Was it not at those who were opposite them (on Ebal)? It turns out that the curses come upon Mount Gerizim, and the blessings, upon Mount Ebal. For that reason, Jotham said: I am standing only on Mount Gerizim when cursing my brother and the people of Shechem. He began by saying (in Jud. 9:8): <small>THE TREES WENT &#x003C; TO ANOINT A KING OVER THEMSELVES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Meshe said: These words that Jotham spoke are a parable. How? <small>THE TREES WENT</small>. These are Israel. (Jud. 9:8, cont.:) <small>AND THEY SAID TO THE OLIVE TREE</small>. This is Othniel ben Kenaz, in that he was from the tribe of Judah (cf. Jud. 1:13; 3:9-11). Thus it is stated (about Judah in Jer. 11:16): <small>&#x003C; THE LORD HAS CALLED YOUR NAME &#x003E; A GREEN OLIVE TREE, &#x003C; FAIR WITH GOOD FRUIT &#x003E;</small>. Now what did Othniel say to them (in Jud. 9:9)? <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY FATNESS</small>? Olive oil is pure. They came to Deborah (according to Jud. 9:10): <small>AND [THE TREES] SAID TO THE FIG TREE: &#x003C; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &#x003E;</small>. This refers to Deborah. She said to them (in vs. 11): <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY SWEETNESS</small>? (Cf. Jud. 5:1:) <small>THEN DEBORAH SANG</small>. (Jud. 9:12:) <small>THEN THE TREES SAID TO THE VINE: &#x003C; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &#x003E;</small>. It said to them (in vs. 13): <small>SHOULD I LEAVE MY NEW WINE? TO THE VINE</small> (in vs. 12) refers to Barak and Gideon (according to Jud. 8:22): <small>RULE OVER US, YOU, &#x003C; YOUR SON, AND YOUR SON&#x2019;S SON AS WELL &#x003E;</small>. He said to them (in vs. 23): <small>I WILL NOT RULE</small>. When they saw this, (according to vs. 14:) <small>THEN ALL THE TREES SAID UNTO THE BRAMBLE: &#x003C; YOU COME AND REIGN OVER US &#x003E;</small>. This refers to Abimelech. Just as this bramble is full of thorns, so was Abimelech full of evil deeds. When they invited him to reign, what did he say to them (in vs. 2): <small>AND REMEMBER THAT I AM YOUR BONE AND YOUR FLESH</small>. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 29:26): <small>MANY SEEK AUDIENCE FROM A RULER, &#x003C; BUT IT IS FROM THE LORD THAT ONE RECEIVES JUSTICE &#x003E;</small>. What did the bramble say to them (in Jud. 9:15)? <small>COME AND TAKE REFUGE IN MY SHADE</small>. Is it not better for you to make me alone king rather than seventy? Immediately (according to Jud. 11:11): <small>AND [THE PEOPLE] SET HIM OVER THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn460">108</xref></sup> Jotham said to them (in Jud. 9:16 or 19, also vs. 20): <small>IF &#x003C; YOU HAVE ACTED &#x003E; TRULY &#x003C; AND UPRIGHTLY&#x2026;. BUT IF NOT, LET FIRE COME FORTH FROM ABIMELECH AND DEVOUR THE PEOPLE OF SHECHEM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Then it written (in vs. 57): <small>AND UPON THEM CAME THE CURSE OF JOTHAM</small>. When? (In Jud. 9:23:) <small>THEN GOD SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT &#x003C; BETWEEN ABIMELECH AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM &#x003E;</small>. Blessed are those who are righteous; for wherever they go, the Holy One preserves them; and they are recognized among the nations. Thus it is stated (in Is. 61:9): <small>AND THEIR SEED IS KNOWN AMONG THE NATIONS</small>.</p>
<title>4.30 Genesis 21:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>. Let our master instruct us: If there is a quarrel between someone and his friend, how is there atonement for him on the Day of Atonement?<sup><xref rid="fn461">109</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Yoma</italic> 8:9): <small>FOR TRANSGRESSIONS THAT ARE BETWEEN SOMEONE AND THE OMNIPRESENT, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT ATONES. FOR &#x003C; TRANSGRESSIONS &#x003E; THAT ARE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS COMPANION, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT DOES NOT ATONE UNTIL HE MAKES PEACE WITH HIS COMPANION</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn462">110</xref></sup> If he went to make peace, and he did not accept, what should he do? R. Jose, the son of a Damascene woman, said:<sup><xref rid="fn463">111</xref></sup> This would be a ready sign<sup><xref rid="fn464">112</xref></sup> for you. Every time that you show mercy to your companion, there is one showing mercy (i.e., the Omnipresent) to you. But if you do not show mercy to your companion, there is no one showing mercy to you.<sup><xref rid="fn465">113</xref></sup> What should he do? R. Samuel ben Nahman said: Let him bring ten people and set them in a single line. Then let him say before them: My brothers, there has been a quarrel between me and such and such a person. So I went to make peace with him, but he did not accept. Immediately the Holy One sees that he has humbled himself before him, and he has mercy on him.<sup><xref rid="fn466">114</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Job 33:27): <small>LET HIM DRAW UP A LINE (<italic>YShWR</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn467">115</xref></sup> OF PEOPLE AND SAY: I HAVE SINNED AND PERVERTED THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT (<italic>yashar</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn468">116</xref></sup> What &#x003C; else &#x003E; is written there (in vs. 28)? <small>SO HE REDEEMS HIS SOUL FROM GOING INTO THE PIT</small>. It is also written (in Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &#x003C; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &#x003E; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. R. Judah said: The one who confesses in order to forsake &#x003C; transgressions &#x003E; shall obtain mercy. Now you find it to be so (in Scripture). All the days that Job was angry with his companions and his companions with him, strict justice was extended against him. Thus it is stated (in Job 30:4): <small>BUT NOW THOSE WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN I LAUGH AT ME</small>. He said to Eliphaz: And are you not a son of Esau?<sup><xref rid="fn469">117</xref></sup> If your father had persisted in begging me to have him eat with my dogs, I should have refused him. (Thus Job 30:1 continues:) <small>WHOSE FATHERS I REFUSED TO SET WITH THE DOGS OF MY FLOCK</small>. Then his companions said: Are you the only venerable one? We also have venerable ones, as stated (in Job 15:10): <small>(WE ALSO HAVE) [WITH US ALSO ARE] BOTH THE OLD AND THE VENERABLE, &#x003C; OLDER THAN YOUR FATHER &#x003E;</small>. Then, when the Holy one appeared to them and said to them: Why are you persisting? Come and make peace with Job. Thus it is stated (in Job 42:8): <small>NOW THEREFORE, TAKE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS, &#x003C; GO UNTO MY SERVANT JOB, AND SACRIFICE A BURNT OFFERING FOR YOURSELVES. &#x003E; THEN LET MY SERVANT JOB PRAY FOR YOU</small>. &#x003C; When the Holy One had so spoken &#x003E;, they immediately went and did so. What is written there (in vs. 10)? <small>AND THE LORD RESTORED THE FORTUNES OF JOB</small>. When? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN HE PRAYED FOR HIS FRIENDS</small>. So &#x003C; it was with &#x003E; Abimelech (according to Gen. 20:17): <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED &#x003C; UNTO GOD; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: Abraham has sought mercy for Abimelech; I will visit him. Immediately (there follows in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.</p>
<title>4.31 Genesis 21:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.] This text is related (to Hab. 3:17): <small>FOR THOUGH THE FIG TREE SHALL NOT BLOSSOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn470">118</xref></sup> Who is this &#x003C; fig tree &#x003E;? This is Abraham, since it is stated (in Hos. 9:10): <small>I SAW YOUR FATHERS AS THE FIRST FRUIT OF A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON</small>. (Hab. 3:17, cont.:) <small>AND THERE IS NO YIELD ON THE VINES. ON THE VINE</small> [sic] refers to Sarah, since it is stated (in Ps. 128:3): <small>YOUR WIFE IS LIKE A FRUITFUL VINE</small>. (Hab. 3:17, cont.:) <small>THOUGH THE WORK OF THE OLIVE HAS FAILED</small>. Were the words which the ministering angels brought as good tidings to Sarah deceptive? &#x003C; They had said &#x003E; (in Gen. 18:10): <small>I WILL SURELY RETURN UNTO YOU</small>. (Hab. 3:17:) <small>THE WORK OF THE OLIVE</small>. As the olive gives light to the world (through its oil), so the angels enlightened &#x003C; Sarah &#x003E; with their words.<sup><xref rid="fn471">119</xref></sup> (Hab. 3:17, cont.:) <small>AND THE GRAINFIELDS (<italic>ShDMH</italic>) PRODUCE NO FOOD</small>. Those breasts (<italic><small>ShDYM</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn472">120</xref></sup> suckle no one. (Hab. 3:17, cont.:) <small>HE HAS DECREED</small><sup><xref rid="fn473">121</xref></sup> <small>A FLOCK FROM THE FOLD</small>. Have you not raised up from her (i.e., from Sarah, the fold) the assembly of Israel, which is called a flock, where it is stated (in Ezek. 34:17): <small>AND YOU, MY FLOCK</small>?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Hab. 3:17, cont.): <small>&#x003C; HE HAS DECREED A FLOCK FROM THE FOLD &#x003E;</small>. This is the decree which you have decreed concerning me when you said (in Gen. 15:5): <small>SO (i.e., like the stars) SHALL YOUR SEED BE</small>. Would you destroy them so that (according to Hab. 3:17, cont.:) <small>THERE SHALL BE NO HERD IN THE STALLS</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn474">122</xref></sup> Have you not raised up from her the tribe of Ephraim? About that &#x003C; tribe &#x003E; there is written (in Hos. 10:11): <small>EPHRAIM IS A TRAINED HEIFER. NO HERD</small>, says our mother Sarah; nevertheless (according to Hab. 3:17, cont.): <small>YET I WILL REJOICE IN THE LORD</small>. Some say: Sarah was not bearing, and others say: Abraham was not begetting; nevertheless, she trusts in the <small>LORD</small>. The Holy One said to her: Since you have put your trust in me, by your life, I am visiting you. Thus it is written (in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn475">123</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.32 Genesis 21:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>. Let our master instruct us: What is meant by abuse?<sup><xref rid="fn476">124</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: It is forbidden for someone to abuse his neighbor. (According to <italic>BM</italic> 4:10:) <small>LET HIM NOT SAY: HOW MUCH DOES THIS COST? IF HE DOES NOT INTEND TO BUY. IF SOMEONE HAS REPENTED, ONE SHOULD NOT ABUSE HIM AND SAY TO HIM: REMEMBER YOUR FORMER DEEDS. IF SOMEONE IS A DESCENDANT OF PROSELYTES, ONE SHOULD NOT SAY TO HIM: REMEMBER THE CONDUCT OF YOUR ANCESTORS</small>; just look at &#x003C; the meat of the &#x003E; pig stuck between their teeth. The Holy One said to them: It is enough for you to be like me. When I, as it were, created my world, I did not desire to abuse creation. So I did not publicize to those coming into the world from what tree the first Adam had eaten.<sup><xref rid="fn477">125</xref></sup> Come and see: Whoever abused his companion was punished from the start. But Sarah abused herself; so she received her reward. She said to Abraham (in Gen. 16:2): <small>PLEASE LOOK AT HOW THE LORD HAS RESTRAINED ME FROM BEARING</small>&#x0021; The Holy One said to her: You have abused yourself. By your life, I am visiting you through the very language that you have spoken. You said: <small>RESTRAINED</small>. What is written elsewhere (in Gen. 20:18)? <small>FOR THE LORD HAD COMPLETELY RESTRAINED EVERY WOMB &#x003C; IN THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH, DUE TO THE WORD OF ABRAHAM&#x2019;S WIFE, SARAH &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: When Abraham prayed to me about the wicked Abimelech, I was filled with compassion for him. Behold, I am visiting Abraham along with him. Where it is stated (in Gen. 20:17): <small>AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH, HIS WIFE, AND HIS FEMALE SERVANTS SO THAT THEY BORE</small>. What is written after that (in Gen. 21:1)? <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.</p>
<title>4.33 Genesis 21:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.] This text is related (to Ezek. 17:24): <small>THEN ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL KNOW THAT I THE LORD</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn478">126</xref></sup> Who are these <small>TREES OF THE FIELD</small>? R. Jacob bar Aha said: These are the children of Adam, as stated (in Deut. 20:19): <small>FOR THE TREE OF THE FIELD IS HUMANITY</small>. (Ezek. 17:24, cont.:) <small>HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE LOFTY TREE</small>. This is Nebuchadnezzar. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE EXALTED THE LOWLY TREE</small>. This refers to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were thrown into the fiery furnace. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE DRIED UP THE GREEN TREE</small>. This is Belshazzar. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE MADE THE WITHERED TREE BUD</small>. This is Daniel.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ezek. 17:14): <small>THEN ALL THE TREES OF THE FIELD SHALL KNOW &#x003C; THAT I THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Abraham. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>&#x003C; THAT I THE LORD &#x003E; HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THE LOFTY TREE</small>. This is Pharaoh. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE EXALTED THE LOWLY TREE</small>. This is Abraham. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE DRIED UP THE GREEN TREE</small>. This is Abimelech. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAVE MADE THE WITHERED TREE BUD</small>. This is Sarah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I THE LORD HAVE SPOKEN, AND I WILL ACT</small>. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.</p>
<title>4.34 Genesis 21:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>[(Gen. 21:1:) <small>AND THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.] R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: Every place that you find <small>AND THE LORD</small>, &#x003C; the words mean &#x003E; &#x201C;he and his <italic>sygkletos</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn479">127</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., his host&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn480">128</xref></sup> &#x007B;Another interpretation: <small>AND THE LORD &#x003C; VISITED SARAH &#x003E;</small>.&#x007D; &#x003C; These words &#x003E; teach that the Holy One sat in judgment and said to his ministering angels: Does Sarah deserve to bear a son? When they all agreed and said: Yes, the Holy One set his seal after theirs. This is the meaning of (Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.35 Genesis 21:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>[(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>.] There are four keys (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>): the key to sustenance, the key to rain, the key to graves, and the key to barren women.<sup><xref rid="fn481">129</xref></sup> Moreover, the four of them are in the hand of the Holy One. Where is it shown about sustenance? Where it is stated (in Ps. 145:16): <small>YOU OPEN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) YOUR HAND &#x003C; AND SATISFY THE DESIRE OF EVERY LIVING BEING &#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown about rain? Where it is stated (in Deut. 28:12): <small>THE LORD WILL OPEN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) FOR YOU &#x003C; HIS BOUNTEOUS TREASURY, THE HEAVENS, TO GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND IN ITS SEASON &#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown about graves? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 37:13): <small>WHEN I HAVE OPENED (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) YOUR GRAVES &#x003C; AND BROUGHT YOU UP OUT OF YOUR GRAVES &#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown about barren women? Where it is stated (in Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED RACHEL&#x2026; AND HE OPENED (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) HER WOMB</small>.</p>
<title>4.36 Genesis 21:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 20:17)? <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED &#x003C; UNTO GOD; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend and loved him exceedingly; so he did everything that his friend asked of him. Since everybody knew that the king loved him exceedingly, anyone who sought an office came to him. Then he would make a request of the king, and he would fulfill his desire for him. Yet, to that friend he did not give any office at all. The people of his palace<sup><xref rid="fn482">130</xref></sup> said to him: Our Lord King, this friend of yours makes requests for others, but for himself he requests nothing. Who is this friend? This is Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>THE SEED OF MY FRIEND ABRAHAM</small>. When Abimelech took Sarah, the Holy One closed up all their springs, as stated (in Gen. 20:18): <small>FOR THE LORD HAD COMPLETELY RESTRAINED &#x003C; EVERY WOMB IN THE HOUSE OF ABIMELECH &#x003E;</small>. When, however, Abimelech made a request of Abraham, he was healed because he had prayed for him. It is so stated (in Gen. 20:17): <small>THEN ABRAHAM PRAYED UNTO GOD; &#x003C; AND GOD HEALED ABIMELECH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The ministering angels said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, Abraham is healing others, but he &#x003C; himself &#x003E; needs healing. He healed Abimelech and his house, so that they bore &#x003C; children &#x003E;. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND GOD HEALED &#x003C; ABIMELECH &#x003E;</small>. So are you not healing him? The Holy One said: He is worth having me give him children. Look at the work of the Holy One&#x0021; It is not like the work of flesh and blood. A human promises to give a gift to his companion. Sometimes he gives it; sometimes he does not give it. But the Holy One is not like that. When he promises to do something good, he immediately does something good. Balaam said (in Numb. 23:19): <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN THAT HE SHOULD LIE</small>. And again he said (ibid.): <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn483">131</xref></sup> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: In this verse the end does not correspond to the beginning, nor the beginning to the end. Thus he says &#x003C; at the beginning of the verse &#x003E;: <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN THAT HE SHOULD LIE</small>&#x2026;. Yet again he says &#x003C; at the end of the verse &#x003E;: <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT; &#x003C; AND WHEN HE HAS SPOKEN, HE WILL NOT FULFILL IT &#x003E;</small>. It is simply that, in the case of a descendant of Adam, <small>WHEN HE HAS PROMISED, HE WILL NOT ACT</small>. But, when the Holy One promises, he acts; when he decrees, he fulfills.<sup><xref rid="fn484">132</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH &#x003C; AS HE HAD PROMISED &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH &#x003C; AS HE HAD PROMISED, AND THE LORD DID UNTO SARAH AS HE HAD SPOKEN &#x003E;</small> at the very time (mentioned in Gen. 18:14): <small>AT THE SET TIME I WILL RETURN UNTO YOU, AT THE TIME THAT LIFE IS DUE, &#x003C; AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON &#x003E;</small>. Zavday bar Levi said: The Holy One scratched for her a mark on the wall.<sup><xref rid="fn485">133</xref></sup> He said to her: When the sun comes to here, you shall bear, as stated (in Gen. 18:14): <small>AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD DID UNTO SARAH AS HE HAD SPOKEN</small>.</p>
<title>4.37 Genesis 21:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Gen. 21:2:) <small>SO SARAH CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON TO ABRAHAM IN HIS OLD AGE</small>. There is an analogy here between her conception and her giving birth. Just as her conception was painless, so was her giving birth painless.<sup><xref rid="fn486">134</xref></sup> Hezekiah bar Hiyya said: What is the meaning of <small>IN HIS OLD AGE</small>? &#x003C; He &#x003E; was grinding &#x003C; away at sexual intercourse &#x003E; and emitting nothing. <small>IN HIS OLD AGE</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; that he was exceedingly aged.</p>
<p>(Gen. 21:6:) <small>SARAH SAID: GOD MADE LAUGHTER FOR ME; &#x003C; EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME &#x003E;</small>. The verse teaches how in the hour that Isaac was born, the sick were healed, the deaf regained their hearing, and the blind began to see.<sup><xref rid="fn487">135</xref></sup> It therefore says: <small>GOD MADE LAUGHTER FOR ME</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME</small>? Surely not that everyone heard&#x0021; But what is the meaning of <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS</small>? That the Holy One increased the light of the sun and the moon. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>AND GOD MADE THE TWO LIGHTS THE GREATER ONES</small>. Therefore: <small>EVERYONE WHO HEARS WILL LAUGH FOR ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn488">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 21:7:) <small>THEN SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED (<italic>MLL</italic>) TO ABRAHAM</small>&#x0021; &#x003C; These words imply &#x003E; that he had within himself the virility of youth&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn489">137</xref></sup> Now the word <small>PROCLAIMED (<italic>MLL</italic>)</small> is nothing but a word &#x003C; implying &#x003E; virility, just as you say (in Deut. 23:26 [25]): <small>THEN YOU SHALL NOT PLUCK RIPE EARS (rt.: <italic>MLL</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn490">138</xref></sup> &#x003C; WITH YOUR HAND &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:7): <small>WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED&#x0021; &#x003C; WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED &#x003E;</small> that my children are going to say to the Holy One at the &#x003C; Reed &#x003E; Sea (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Gen. 21:7, cont.:) <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said in the name of R. Hilqiyah: Now she did not bear Isaac alone, since it says <small>SARAH WILL SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>. But what is the meaning (of ibid.): <small>WHO WOULD HAVE PROCLAIMED (<italic>MLL</italic>)&#x0021;</small> <italic>M</italic> is forty; <italic>L</italic> &#x003C; plus &#x003E; <italic>L</italic> equal sixty for a total of one hundred.<sup><xref rid="fn491">139</xref></sup> Who would have announced the good news to Abraham that at age one hundred you will beget a son&#x0021;</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 21:7, cont.): <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN&#x0021;</small> R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: When Sarah bore, the women of the gentile nations were skeptical and said: Is it possible for her to give birth? They also said to each other: Now is not Sarah an old woman? But perhaps it was her bondwoman. So what did they do? Taking their children, they went to Sarah and said: Suckle this child. Then she suckled their children, as stated (in Gen. 21:7, cont.): <small>THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021;</p>
<title>4.38 Genesis 21:1ff., Part IX</title>
<p>Our masters have said: All the Egyptian women&#x2019;s children whom Sarah suckled, all of them became proselytes; and do not be surprised at the news. So you find the following in the case of Eliphaz ben Esau (of Gen. 36:10f.; I Chron. 1:35f.): Because he grew up in the bosom of Isaac, he became righteous and was worthy of having the Holy Spirit rest (<italic>Sharah</italic>) <sup><xref rid="fn492">140</xref></sup> upon him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. R. Eleazar &#x007B;bar Simeon&#x007D; was the son of R. Simeon ben Johay.<sup><xref rid="fn493">141</xref></sup> R. Jose ben Halafta saw him. He said to him: You stem from a root of righteous people, but you are not a Torah scholar. He said to him: Then what should I do? He said to him: Do you want to learn? He said: Yes. He began teaching him one chapter, then a second, then a third. They brought him to the academy. Rabbi (Judah the Prince) saw him. He said to him: Have you brought this one with you? He said to him: He comes from the trunk of R. Simeon ben Johay. R. Jose brought him up to Sepphoris and instructed him. The next year he brought him down with him and entered the academy. When he began to give answers there, our holy master (Rabbi Judah the Prince) applied &#x003C; Prov. 11:30 &#x003E; to him: <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn494">142</xref></sup> Who caused him to become a Torah scholar? Was it not through R. Jose ben Halafta? Similarly in the case of the children who nursed from our mother Sarah, all of them became proselytes. The Holy One said: In this world individuals have become proselytes through the righteous ones, but in the world to come I will draw near the righteous and bring them under the wings of the Divine Presence. Thus it is stated (in Zeph. 3:9): <small>FOR THEN WILL I MAKE THE PEOPLES PURE OF SPEECH, SO THAT THEY ALL MAY INVOKE THE LORD BY NAME AND SERVE HIM WITH ONE ACCORD</small>.</p>
<title>4.39 Genesis 22:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 22:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, &#x003C; THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 126:6): <small>THOUGH HE GOES AWAY WEEPING, BEARING HIS SEED BAG, HE SHALL SURELY COME BACK BEARING HIS SHEAVES WITH REJOICING. THOUGH HE GOES AWAY</small>: This refers to Abraham in the hour that the Holy One tested him and said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &#x003C; YOUR SON &#x2026; AND OFFER HIM &#x2026; AS A BURNT OFFERING &#x003E;</small>. Even though he was weeping in his heart, he told him with his mouth (in vs. 1): <small>HERE I AM</small>. When? When <small>BEARING HIS SEED BAG</small>. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>. (Ps. 126:6:) <small>HE SHALL COME BACK WITH REJOICING, BEARING HIS SHEAVES</small>. (Cf. Gen. 22:19:) <small>SO ABRAHAM RETURNED UNTO HIS YOUNG MEN</small>. What caused him to receive a reward? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because he kept silent and made himself like a one who is dumb, as stated (in Ps. 38:14 [13]): <small>LIKE ONE WHO IS DEAF I DO NOT HEAR, [AND LIKE ONE WHO IS DUMB (<italic>&#x2019;LM</italic>) HE DOES NOT OPEN HIS MOUTH]</small>. Then he had an excuse for saying to him: Yesterday you said to me (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>; but now you are telling me to slaughter him. Still, he did not say anything but kept silent. Ergo (in Ps. 126:6): <small>HE SHALL COME BACK WITH REJOICING, BEARING HIS SHEAVES (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>LM</italic>)</small>.</p>
<title>4.40 Genesis 22:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, &#x003C; THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT, NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>. R. Aha said: <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT</small>, the one which I made with Abraham when I said to him (according to Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>. (Ps. 89:35 [34]:) <small>NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>, because I have said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &#x003C; YOUR SON &#x003E;</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who said to his friend: I yearn to see a small child on my table. Immediately his friend went, brought his son, and set him on the table before the king. Then he went and brought his sword to slaughter him. Immediately, however, the king cried out and said to him: What are you doing? He said to him: But did you not say to me: I yearn to see a small child on my table. He said to him: I told you a living child. &#x003C; Would &#x003E; I have possibly &#x003C; meant &#x003E; a dead one? Similarly the Holy One said to Abraham: <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>. Immediately (in Gen. 22:9f.): <small>AND ABRAHAM BUILT AN ALTAR THERE &#x2026; THEN ABRAHAM STRETCHED FORTH HIS HAND &#x003C; AND TOOK THE KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER HIS SON &#x003E;</small>. The angel cried to him (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>. Abraham said to him: Did you not say to me (in vs. 2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>? He said to him: Would I have told you<sup><xref rid="fn495">143</xref></sup> to slaughter him? Ergo (in Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT, NOR WILL I ALTER THE UTTERANCE OF MY LIPS</small>.</p>
<p>Thus have our masters taught: (According to Jer. 19:5:) <small>&#x003C; AND THEY HAVE BUILT HIGH PLACES TO BAAL FOR BURNING THEIR SONS IN THE FIRE, BURNT OFFERINGS TO BAAL &#x003E;, WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED, NEVER SPOKE FOR, AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small>. I did not command Jephthah (in Jud. 11) to sacrifice his daughter, and I did not tell the king of Moab (in II Kings 3:27) to sacrifice his son. Moreover, it <small>NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small> to tell Abraham to slaughter his son. On what did they base a command concerning Jephthah? R. Mayasha said: <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Jephthah. Now I did give him many &#x003C; other &#x003E; positive commandments and negative commandments because he was of Israel, but I did not command him to sacrifice his daughter. Nor did I speak to the king of Moab. Our masters have said: On what did they base an oracle to the king of Moab? It is simply that the Holy One said: Would I ever have spoken with him? Would it not have been a disgrace? Rather I did not speak with him at any time &#x003C; about anything &#x003E;, much less that he sacrifice his son&#x0021; So it <small>NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small> to tell Abraham to slaughter his son. Even though I said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE &#x003C; YOUR SON &#x003E;</small>, it never entered my mind that he would slaughter his son. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 89:35 [34]): <small>I WILL NOT DEFILE MY COVENANT</small>.</p>
<title>4.41 Genesis 22:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, [THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM]</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 17:3): <small>A CRUCIBLE IS FOR SILVER AND A FURNACE FOR GOLD, BUT THE LORD TESTS HEARTS</small>. (Gen. 22:2:) <small>AND HE SAID: PLEASE TAKE &#x003C; YOUR SON &#x003E;</small>. Immediately (in vs. 3): <small>SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>. He went and built the altar. Then he put Isaac up on top of the altar, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>&#x003C; AND ABRAHAM BUILT AN ALTAR THERE &#x003E; &#x2026; THEN HE BOUND HIS SON ISAAC [AND SET HIM ON THE ALTAR ABOVE THE WOOD]</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ABOVE</small>? &#x003C; This &#x003E; teaches that he made the altar exactly under the throne of glory, just as one says (in Is. 6:2): <small>ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn496">144</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.42 Genesis 22:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS</small>. What reflection took place there?<sup><xref rid="fn497">145</xref></sup> Isaac was reflecting on when he had contended with Ishmael. [Now Ishmael had complained] and said: I am older than you. I shall inherit the world because I am my father&#x2019;s first-born, and the first-born always inherits twofold (according to Deut. 21:15-17). Isaac said to him: Tell me, what does the Holy One have of yours? Ishmael said to him: I will tell you what I have done, if I have done nothing else. Because I was thirteen years old when Daddy circumcised me, I could have said: It is not my wish to be circumcised; but I gave my life &#x003C; blood &#x003E; and took &#x003C; circumcision &#x003E; upon myself. Isaac said to him: See, all that you loaned<sup><xref rid="fn498">146</xref></sup> to the Holy One were three drops of blood. But I know that when the Holy One wants me to be slaughtered, now when I am thirty-seven years old,<sup><xref rid="fn499">147</xref></sup> and the Holy One is telling daddy to sacrifice me, I will not prevent &#x003C; him &#x003E;. The Holy One said to the angels: Now is the hour. He immediately rushed to Abraham. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER (&#x2019;<italic>HR</italic>) THESE THINGS</small>. Hence you learn that there were reflections (<italic>HRHR</italic>) over things there.</p>
<title>4.43 Genesis 22:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 22:1, cont.:) <small>THAT GOD TESTED (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>) ABRAHAM</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 60:6 [4]): <small>YOU HAVE GIVEN THOSE WHO FEAR YOU A TRIAL (<italic>NS</italic>) IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FLEE (rt.: <italic>NWS</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn500">148</xref></sup> &#x003C; ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn501">149</xref></sup> &#x003C; The passage refers to &#x003E; a flight (rt.: NWS) through which Israel has been delivered from the judgment of Gehinnom. &#x007B;Another interpretation: <small>A TRIAL (<italic>NS</italic>) IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FLEE (rt.: <italic>NWS</italic>)</small>&#x007D; <small>ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH</small>. &#x003C; The reason is &#x003E; in order to grant &#x003C; Israel &#x003E; a reward in truth, as stated (in Is. 61:8): <small>AND I WILL GIVE THEM THEIR RECOMPENSE IN TRUTH</small>. The wicked, however, have no flight, as stated (in Job 11:20): <small>BUT THE EYES OF THE WICKED FAIL; AND RETREAT IS CUT OFF FROM THEM</small>. (Ps. 60:6 [4]:) <small>YOU HAVE GIVEN THOSE WHO FEAR YOU A TRIAL (<italic>NS</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn502">150</xref></sup> Come and see the difference between the early &#x003C; ancestors &#x003E; and those who came later&#x0021; The early ones were tested (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>) at the hands of the Holy One, as stated (in Gen. 22:1): <small>THAT GOD TESTED (<italic>NSH</italic>) ABRAHAM</small>. So also with the people of the wilderness generation (according to Exod. 16:4): <small>SO THAT I MAY TEST &#x003C; THE PEOPLE &#x003E; AS TO WHETHER THEY SHALL WALK IN MY TORAH OR NOT</small>. It also says this (in Deut. 8:16): <small>IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOU [AND IN ORDER] TO TEST YOU</small>&#x2026;. Those who came later, however, were tested at the hands of the nations, as stated (in Jud. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NATIONS WHICH THE LORD LEFT TO TEST ISRAEL</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:6 [4]): <small>YOU HAVE GIVEN THOSE WHO FEAR YOU A TRIAL (<italic>NS</italic>) IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FLEE (rt.: <italic>NWS</italic>) ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ON ACCOUNT OF TRUTH. SELAH</small>? &#x003C; The words refer to &#x003E; whoever has been tested (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>) and withstood trials (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>). And so you find in the case of Daniel and his companions, that when they went into exile, the Holy One decreed for them to eat unclean bread. It is so stated (in Ezek. 4:13): <small>SO SHALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL EAT THEIR UNCLEAN BREAD AMONG THE GENTILES WHERE I SHALL BANISH THEM</small>. Nebuchadnezzar arose and fulfilled the oracle. He began by saying: I decree that they eat of my food. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 1:5): <small>AND THE KING APPOINTED FOR THEM &#x003C; A DAILY PORTION OF THE KING&#x2019;S FOOD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Daniel did not accept it. Instead he said: Although the Holy One has decreed for us to eat unclean bread, he wants to test us. We, however, will do our part; and the Holy One will do his. He began to say [to the captain of the guards (in Dan. 1:12f.): If you please], <small>PRAY, TEST (<italic>NS</italic>) YOUR SERVANTS FOR TEN DAYS, [AND GIVE US SOME LEGUMES TO EAT AND WATER TO DRINK. THEN LET OUR APPEARANCE AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHILDREN WHO EAT THE KING&#x2019;S FOOD BE LOOKED AT IN YOUR PRESENCE, AND DEAL WITH YOUR SERVANTS ACCORDING TO WHAT YOU SEE]</small>. He said to them: But are you able to stand the test (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>) for ten days without eating bread or drinking wine? They said to him: Yes, because we are of the children of that person who withstood the test of ten trials from God. His merit will stand by us. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 1:12): <small>PRAY, TEST (<italic>NS</italic>) YOUR SERVANTS</small>. Has not the king already found us ten times better than the magicians? By whose merit? By the merit of Abraham, who withstood the test of ten trials.<sup><xref rid="fn503">151</xref></sup> Once they had withstood their trial (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>), what is written (in Dan. 1:9, 14-15): <small>THEN GOD GRANTED DANIEL [MERCY AND COMPASSION BEFORE THE CHIEF OF THE EUNUCHS&#x2026;. SO HE HEEDED THEM IN THIS MATTER AND TESTED (rt.: <italic>NSH</italic>) THEM FOR TEN DAYS. THEN AT THE END OF TEN DAYS, THEIR APPEARANCE WAS SEEN TO BE BETTER AND THEIR FLESH FATTER THAN ALL THE CHILDREN WHO HAD EATEN THE KING&#x2019;S FOOD]</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:6 [4]): <small>YOU HAVE GIVEN THOSE WHO FEAR YOU A TRIAL (<italic>NS</italic>) IN ORDER TO HAVE A MIRACLE OCCUR (rt.: <italic>NWS</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn504">152</xref></sup> In Ps. 60:6 [4] what is the meaning of (<italic>NS</italic>)? &#x003C; That &#x003E; you have made them great. It is just as it is stated (in Is. 30:17): <small>AND LIKE A BANNER (<italic>NS</italic>)</small><sup><xref rid="fn505">153</xref></sup> <small>UPON A HILL</small>. So why did the Holy One test (<italic>NSH</italic>) them? In order to make them great. In order not to give the nations of the world a pretext for saying: He has made them great, but he did not test them. So they endured their test. Therefore (in Gen. 22:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, [THAT GOD TESTED ABRAHAM]</small>.</p>
<title>4.44 Genesis 22:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 22:1, end:) <small>AND HE SAID: HERE AM I</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; <small>HERE AM I</small> for the priesthood; <small>HERE AM I</small> for the kingship;<sup><xref rid="fn506">154</xref></sup> <small>HERE AM I</small> &#x003C; ready &#x003E; to slaughter &#x003C; my son &#x003E; ; <small>HERE AM I</small> &#x003C; ready &#x003E; to be killed.</p>
<p>(Gen. 22:2:) <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>. He said to him: Which son? He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>YOUR ONLY SON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn507">155</xref></sup> He said to him: This one (Isaac) is the only &#x003C; son &#x003E; of his mother, and that &#x003C; other &#x003E; one (Ishmael) is the only &#x003C; son &#x003E; of his mother. He said to him: The one whom you love. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, is there a limit to the affections? He said to him: <small>ISAAC</small>.</p>
<title>4.45 Genesis 22:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 22:2, cont.:) <small>GO UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH</small>. R. Jannay and R. Hiyya differ.<sup><xref rid="fn508">156</xref></sup> R. Jannay says: What is Moriah? The place from which &#x007B;light&#x007D; [religious awe] went forth to the world, as stated (in Ps. 68:36 [35]): <small>YOU ARE AWESOME (<italic>mora</italic>), O GOD, OUT OF YOUR HOLY PLACES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn509">157</xref></sup> R. Hiyya said: The place from which &#x007B;the Torah&#x007D; [instruction (<italic>hora&#x2019;ah</italic>)] goes forth to the world, as stated (in Is. 2:3 // Micah 4:2): <small>FOR THE TORAH SHALL COME FORTH OUT OF ZION</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of Moriah: [R. Joshua ben Levi said:] The place from which the righteous give instructions (<italic>moreh</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn510">158</xref></sup> to the Holy One, and he acts &#x003C; upon them &#x003E;. It is so stated (in I Chron. 24:5): <small>AND BY LOTS &#x007B;HE&#x007D; [THEY] ORGANIZED [THEM], &#x003C; ONE GROUP WITH ANOTHER &#x003E;</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: What is the meaning of Moriah? The place where the Holy One gives instructions (<italic>moreh</italic>) for the wicked and casts them down to Gehinnom, as stated (in Ps. 49:15 [14]): <small>LIKE SHEEP THEY ARE APPOINTED FOR SHEOL; [DEATH IS THEIR SHEPHERD, THE UPRIGHT SHALL RULE OVER THEM IN THE MORNING, AND THEIR FORM SHALL WASTE AWAY WITH NO LOFTY DWELLING FOR IT]</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay says: What is the meaning of Moriah? A place of teaching (<italic>moreh</italic>) situated (<italic>MKWN</italic>) directly under the Holy Temple above, as stated (in Exod. 15:17): <small>[O LORD, YOU HAVE MADE] A SITE (<italic>MKWN</italic>) FOR YOURSELF TO DWELL IN, [A SANCTUARY, O LORD, WHICH YOUR HANDS HAVE ESTABLISHED]</small>. R. Judah ben Palma says: What is the meaning of Moriah (<italic>Moriyyah</italic>)? Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, to what place shall we go? The Holy One said to him: To the place that I <italic>qoshet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn511">159</xref></sup> for you. Now this word (<italic>qoshet</italic>) is nothing but an expression for <italic>qishshut</italic>. <sup><xref rid="fn512">160</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:13): <small>NO HAND SHALL TOUCH HIM, &#x003C; BUT HE SHALL SURELY BE STONED &#x003E; OR SHOT (<italic>YRH</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn513">161</xref></sup> R. Pinhas ben Hama the Priest says: What is the meaning of Moriah? The place of authority (<italic>maruteh</italic>) for the world. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in I Chron. 13:6): <small>THEN DAVID [AND ALL ISRAEL] WENT UP TO BAALAH, THAT IS, UNTO KIRIATH-JEARIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn514">162</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.46 Genesis 22:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Gen. 22:2:) <small>GO</small> (<italic>Lekh-lekha</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn515">163</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: The first trial<sup><xref rid="fn516">164</xref></sup> &#x003C; was given &#x003E; through &#x003C; the words &#x003E; <italic>Lekh-lekha</italic>, as stated (in Gen. 12:10): <small>GO FROM YOUR &#x003C; NATIVE &#x003E; LAND, FROM YOUR BIRTHPLACE</small>. Now the last trial &#x003C; is given here &#x003E; through &#x003C; the words &#x003E; <italic>Lekh-lekha</italic> <small>(GO) UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 22:4:) <small>ON THE THIRD DAY ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES</small>. And why on the third day rather than on the first day or second day?<sup><xref rid="fn517">165</xref></sup> So that the peoples of the world would not say: He confounded him into going and slaughtering his son; for if he had been in his &#x003C; right &#x003E; mind, he would not have heeded him in sacrificing his son. Ergo: <small>ON THE THIRD DAY [&#x2026;]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn518">166</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 22:4, cont.:) <small>AND SAW THE PLACE FROM A DISTANCE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FROM A DISTANCE? A DISTANCE</small> is a mile,<sup><xref rid="fn519">167</xref></sup> as stated (in Josh. 3:4): <small>YET THERE SHALL BE A DISTANCE [BETWEEN YOU AND IT OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CUBITS]</small>. Abraham saw it &#x007B;and said to his lads: Do you see anything? They said to him: No.&#x007D; He said to Isaac: Do you see anything?<sup><xref rid="fn520">168</xref></sup> He said to him: I see a beautiful and praiseworthy mountain with a cloud joined to it. He said to the lads: Do you see anything? &#x007B;They said to him: We see a high mountain on which there are woods and trees.&#x007D; [They said to him: No.] He said to them [(in Gen. 22:5): <small>STAY HERE WITH (&#x2018;<italic>M</italic>) THE DONKEY</small>.] As the donkey sees and does not understand, so you are a people (&#x2018;<italic>M</italic>) who are like the donkey.</p>
<p>(Gen. 22:5, cont.:) <small>WHILE THE LAD AND I GO OVER THERE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>OVER THERE (<italic>koh</italic>)</small>? Let us go and see what is to be the eventual outcome of this word <italic>koh</italic>. Which <italic>koh?</italic> The one which is used (in Gen. 15:5): <small>SO (<italic>koh</italic>) SHALL YOUR SEED BE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn521">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 22:5, cont.:) <small>AND WE (i.e., both of us) WILL RETURN UNTO YOU</small>. His mouth proclaimed that &#x003C; Isaac &#x003E; would come and return. The Holy Spirit says (in Prov. 16:1): <small>TO A HUMAN BELONG THE THOUGHTS OF THE HEART, [BUT THE REPLY OF THE TONGUE COMES FROM THE LORD]</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 22:6:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK [THE WOOD FOR THE BURNT OFFERING AND SET IT UPON HIS SON ISAAC]</small>. To whom was Isaac comparable? To one who (after being condemned to death) was going out to be burned with his wood on his shoulders. <sup><xref rid="fn522">170</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 22:6, cont.:) <small>WHILE HE TOOK [THE FIRE AND THE KNIFE <italic>(ma&#x2019;akhelet</italic>)] IN HIS OWN HAND</small>. Why is <italic>ma&#x2019;akhelet</italic> (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>KL</italic>) written &#x003C; here for <small>KNIFE</small> &#x003E; and <italic>sakin</italic> (which also means &#x201C;knife&#x201D;) not written? Because Israel ate a lot of food (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>KL</italic>) under his &#x007B;bounty&#x007D; [hand].<sup><xref rid="fn523">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 22:6, cont.:) <small>SO BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER</small>, the one to slaughter and the other to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 22:6, cont.): <small>SO BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER</small>. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: While they were walking, Satan came to Isaac on his right hand and said: Alas, wretched son of a wretched woman, how many fasts did your mother fast until you came?<sup><xref rid="fn524">172</xref></sup> Now the old man has gone mad in his old age, and here he is going to slaughter you. Isaac turned back and said to his father: Look at what this one is saying to me&#x0021; He said to him: He has come to confuse you, but the Holy One shall not confuse us, as stated (in Gen. 22:8): <small>GOD WILL SEE TO THE LAMB FOR A BURNT OFFERING</small>. So nevertheless (according to Gen. 22:6): <small>SO BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF TOGETHER</small>. How old was Isaac? He was thirty-seven years old.<sup><xref rid="fn525">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 22:9:) <small>AND THEY CAME TO THE PLACE</small>. When he came to slaughter him, Isaac said to him: Bind me hand and foot because the instinct of life is strong.<sup><xref rid="fn526">174</xref></sup> It is likely that before the knife comes, I would tremble and be disqualified as a sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn527">175</xref></sup> Please &#x003C; bind me &#x003E;, my father, lest a blemish be inflicted on me.</p>
<p>(Gen. 22:10f.:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM STRETCHED OUT &#x003C; HIS HAND AND TOOK THE KNIFE TO SLAUGHTER HIS SON &#x003E;, BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED UNTO HIM OUT OF THE HEAVENS</small>&#x2026;. He said to him: Who are you? He said to him: An angel. He said to him: The Holy One told me (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE</small>&#x2026;. Now you are saying (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT STRETCH OUT &#x003C; YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD &#x003E;</small>. At that time (in vs. 11): <small>BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED</small>. And Why did he call to him? To talk to him. And What did he say to him? He said to him (in vs. 11): <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM&#x0021;</small> And why two times? It is simply like a person who is walking on a remote road with his companion and leaves him behind. Then he calls to him: My companion, my companion&#x0021; So the angel called: <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM</small>, what are you doing? And why did he talk to him hurriedly? Because Abraham was in a hurry to slaughter him. At that time Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, one tests his companion when he does not know what is in his companion&#x2019;s heart. &#x003C; But &#x003E; you, since you search out hearts and kidneys, did you have to do this to me? Was it not revealed to you, when you told me to sacrifice my son, that I would wholeheartedly hasten to slaughter him?<sup><xref rid="fn528">176</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: &#x003C; I did so &#x003E; in order to make known to the peoples of the world that I did not choose you without a reason. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT &#x003C; YOU &#x003E; FEAR&#x003C; GOD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of 22:11): <small>BUT &#x003C; THE ANGEL OF THE LORD &#x003E; CALLED UNTO HIM</small>. Abraham said to him: Who are you? He said to him: I am an angel. Abraham said to him: When the Holy One told me to sacrifice him, he told me so himself. So now I ask that he himself tell me &#x003C; to stop &#x003E;. Immediately the Holy One, having opened the firmament and the lower sky, said to him (in Gen. 22:16): <small>I BY MYSELF HAVE SWORN</small>. Abraham said to him: So now you have sworn&#x0021; But I also have sworn that I am not coming down from this altar until I say everything that I must. He said to him: Say everything that you must. Abraham said to him: Did you not tell me that what you would raise up from me would completely fill up the world, as stated (in Gen. 15:5): <small>AND COUNT THE STARS &#x2026; SO SHALL YOUR SEED BE</small>? The Holy One said to him: Yes. He said to him: From whom? He said to him: From Isaac. He said to him: And did you not tell me that you would multiply my children like the dust, as stated (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>? The Holy One said to him: Yes. He said to him: From whom? He said to him: From Isaac. He said to him: Just as I had the right to talk back to you and did not say anything to you, O Sovereign of the World&#x2014;Yesterday you said (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL SEED BE SUMMONED FOR YOU</small>; but now you are saying (in Gen. 22:2): <small>AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING</small>. Yet I suppressed my urge and did not talk back to you. &#x003C; Just as I have acted in this way &#x003E;, you also, when Isaac&#x2019;s children sin against you and enter into sorrow, remember on their behalf the binding of their father Isaac. Forgive them, and redeem them from their sorrows. The Holy One said to them: You have had your say; I will also have mine. The Holy One said to him: Your children are going to be sinful in my presence, &#x003C; and I am going &#x003E; to judge them on New Year&#x2019;s day. However, if they ask me to forgive them and blow a <italic>shofar</italic> before me on that day&#x2014;Abraham said to him: And what is a <italic>shofar</italic>? The Holy One said to him: Do you not know? He said to him: Turn around and look. Immediately (as we read in Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES [TO LOOK AND THERE WAS A RAM BEHIND HIM CAUGHT IN A THICKET ON HIS HORNS]</small>. It says here nothing but <small>ON HIS HORNS</small>. He said to him: They will blow on a horn before me, and I will forgive their sins. In that hour he gave praise and thanksgiving to the Holy One; and that is how David gave praise<sup><xref rid="fn529">177</xref></sup> (in II Sam. 22:3 // Ps. 18:3 [2]): <small>&#x003C; THE LORD &#x2026; MY SHIELD &#x003E; AND MY HORN OF SALVATION</small>. And it says also (in Joel 2:15): <small>BLOW A <italic>SHOFAR</italic> IN ZION</small>. The beginning (of the verse) concerns New Year&#x2019;s day. Then afterwards (ibid., cont.): <small>SANCTIFY A FAST</small>. This refers to the Day of Atonement, &#x003C; which comes &#x003E; after ten days, on which the Holy One forgives their sins. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;. Blessed are you, O Israel&#x0021; How the Holy One has loved you&#x0021; &#x003C; He has done for you &#x003E; what he has not done for any people or tongue, as stated (in Ps. 111:6): <small>HE HAS DECLARED THE POWER OF HIS WORKS TO HIS PEOPLE &#x003C; IN GIVING THEM THE HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS &#x003E;</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL</small>. And it is written (in vs. 20): <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION; AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM. HALLELUJAH.</small></p>

The attribution of the verse to Joab, the head of David&#x2019;s army, is assumed because the person depicted here comes first in a listing of David&#x2019;s mighty men and is identified as the chief of David&#x2019;s captains. Moreover, although the listing contains no specific mention of Joab, it does contain the names of Joab&#x2019;s brothers (in vss. 18 &#x0026; 24) and even his armor bearer (in vs. 37).</ftnote>

The extra person comes from counting Serah twice because of her long life. Numb. 26:46 shows that she was still alive at the time of the Exodus. Moreover, it was not too difficult to imagine that so old a woman had lived even longer into the reign of David and identify her with the wise woman of II Sam. 20:16.

<title>Chapter 5 Genesis, Parashah V: <italic>Hayye Sarah</italic></title>
<title>5.1 Genesis 23:1ff., 24:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 23:1:) <small>NOW &#x003C; THE LENGTH OF &#x003E; SARAH&#x2019;S LIFE WAS &#x003C; A HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS &#x003E;</small>. (Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, WELL ALONG IN YEARS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 5:13 [12]): <small>FOR YOU BLESS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE, &#x003C; O LORD, ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR AS WITH A BUCKLER &#x003E;</small>. From when the world was created until Abraham arose, the Holy One would bless his world. So, when he had created Adam and Eve, he blessed them, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>AND GOD BLESSED THEM</small>&#x2026;. He blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. When Abraham arose, he made him a father for all creatures,<sup><xref rid="fn530">1</xref></sup> as stated (in Gen. 12:2f): <small>AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING&#x2026;. &#x003C; FOR IN YOU SHALL ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 5:13 [12]): <small>FOR YOU BLESS THE RIGHTEOUS ONE</small> (i.e., Abraham), <small>O LORD, ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR AS WITH A BUCKLER</small>, in that the Holy One became like a shield for him, as stated (in Gen. 15:1): <small>I AM YOUR SHIELD</small>. Now a buckler is nothing but a shield, as shown in the verse (I Sam. 17:7): <small>AND THE ONE BEARING THE BUCKLER WAS GOING BEFORE HIM</small> (i.e., Goliath). What is the meaning of <small>ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR?</small> That he blessed Abraham in his old age, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.</p>
<title>5.2 Genesis 24:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>. The beginning of Torah is steadfast love, its middle is steadfast love, and its end is steadfast love.<sup><xref rid="fn531">2</xref></sup> Its beginning is steadfast love in that he has rendered steadfast love to bridegrooms and brides. He rendered steadfast love to Adam and Eve, as stated (in Gen. 2:22): <small>THEN GOD BUILT THE RIB &#x003C; WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE MAN INTO A WOMAN &#x003E;</small>. R. Abbahu said: In Arabia they call the plaited coiffure a &#x201C;building.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn532">3</xref></sup> The Holy One adorned Eve and brought her to Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn533">4</xref></sup> Do you suppose that he brought her to him under an olive tree? Or under a fig tree? Our masters have said: The Holy One made thirteen bridal canopies for Adam and Eve, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13): <small>YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD; &#x003C; EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS YOUR COVERING: CARNELIAN, CHRYSOLITE, AMETHYST, BERYL, LAPIS LAZULI, JASPER, SAPPHIRE, TURQUOISE, EMERALD, AND GOLD &#x003E;</small>. And the least of them is gold; for so it is written: <small>EMERALD, AND GOLD</small> (i.e., with gold in last place). Thus &#x003C; there were &#x003E; thirteen bridal canopies which were made for Adam and Eve.<sup><xref rid="fn534">5</xref></sup> R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: The Holy One adorned Eve with twenty-four ornaments. And not only that, but he took her by the hand and brought her to Adam. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: Blessed is a provincial who has seen this: the king taking &#x003C; his bride &#x003E; by the hand and bringing her to the house for him.<sup><xref rid="fn535">6</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 2:22, cont.): <small>AND BROUGHT HER TO ADAM</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>. Thus the beginning of Torah is steadfast love. Its middle also is steadfast love. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 35:8): <small>THEN REBEKAH&#x2019;S NURSE, DEBORAH, DIED</small>. When she had died, what is written (ibid.)? <small>AND ITS NAME</small> (i.e., the name of her burial place) <small>WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK</small>, for Jacob was sitting there and weeping over her. The Holy One said: Jacob is sitting and grieving. He appeared to him visibly, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>NOW THE LORD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN&#x2026; &#x003C; AND BLESSED HIM &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn536">7</xref></sup> And its end is steadfast love, &#x003C; as seen in the case &#x003E; of Moses; for, when he passed away, he buried him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 34:6): <small>AND &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; BURIED HIM IN THE VALLEY IN THE LAND OF MOAB</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): <small>ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn537">8</xref></sup> Abraham persisted in clinging to a measure of steadfast love. The Holy One said to him: This measure was mine and you have taken it. By your life, I am making you &#x003C; old &#x003E; like me. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Dan. 7:9): <small>AS I LOOKED, THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE, AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT. HIS GARMENT WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW, &#x003C; AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKE PURE WOOL &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn538">9</xref></sup> What is written elsewhere on the matter (in Gen. 23:19)? <small>THEN AFTERWARDS ABRAHAM BURIED HIS WIFE SARAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn539">10</xref></sup> He persisted in clinging to her. The Holy One said to him. You deserve a crown. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small> (i.e., with a crown of white hair).</p>
<title>5.3 Genesis 24:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 31:10): <small>WHO CAN FIND A GALLANT WIFE?</small><sup><xref rid="fn540">11</xref></sup> About whom were the words spoken? &#x003C; They were spoken about Sarah &#x003E; since it is written above (in Gen. 23:2): <small>AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; he began to weep and eulogize. So he said: When shall I be able to get &#x003C; another wife &#x003E; like you?<sup><xref rid="fn541">12</xref></sup> (Prov. 31:10:) <small>A GALLANT WIFE</small>. This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:11): <small>SEE HERE NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING WOMAN</small>. (Prov. 31:10, cont.:) <small>HER VALUE WAS FAR BEYOND THAT OF RUBIES</small>, in that you came from afar. Thus it is stated (in Is. 46:11): <small>SUMMONING A BIRD OF PREY FROM THE EAST, MY CONFIDANT FROM A FAR COUNTRY</small>. (Prov. 31:11:) <small>HER HUSBAND&#x2019;S HEART HAD CONFIDENCE IN HER</small>: This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:13): <small>[PLEASE SAY YOU ARE MY SISTER] SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU</small>. (Prov. 31:11, cont.:) <small>AND HE HAS NO LACK OF PROFIT</small>. This refers to our father Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 13:2): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS VERY RICH</small>. (Prov. 31:12:) <small>SHE DID GOOD FOR HIM AND NOT EVIL</small>. This refers to Sarah, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:16): <small>AND BECAUSE OF HER, IT WENT WELL WITH ABRAHAM</small>. (Prov. 31:13:) <small>SHE LOOKS FOR WOOL AND FLAX</small>, &#x003C; in choosing &#x003E; between &#x003C; flaxen &#x003E; Ishmael and &#x003C; the pure wool of &#x003E; Isaac. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:9f.): <small>THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN &#x2026; AND SAID TO ABRAHAM: CAST OUT THIS SLAVE WOMAN &#x003C; AND HER SON &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Prov. 31:14:) <small>SHE WAS LIKE THE MERCHANT SHIPS</small>, in that she was moving from place to place and from country to country. Like such a vessel which goes from place to place on the sea (according to Prov. 31:14, cont.): <small>SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR</small>. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 20:16): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO SARAH: SEE, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND SILVER PIECES</small>. (Prov. 31:15:) <small>SHE ALSO AROSE WHILE IT WAS STILL NIGHT AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD</small>. When? (In Gen. 22:3:) <small>SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>&#x2026;. (Prov. 31:15, cont.:) <small>AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD, EVEN A STATUTE</small><sup><xref rid="fn542">13</xref></sup> <small>FOR HER YOUNG WOMEN</small>. (Gen. 17:26:) <small>ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM WAS CIRCUMCISED</small>&#x2026;. Now <small>STATUTE</small> can only mean circumcision, as shown (in Ps. 105:10): <small>AND HE ESTABLISHED IT</small> (i.e., Abraham&#x2019;s covenant) <small>FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE, FOR ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn543">14</xref></sup> (Prov. 31:16:) <small>SHE SET HER MIND ON A FIELD AND BOUGHT IT</small>. Thus, while she was alive, she had her mind on obtaining the cave of Machpelah <small>AND BOUGHT IT</small>, for here she is buried in it (cf. Gen. 23). (Prov. 31:16, cont.:) <small>FROM THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS SHE PLANTED A VINEYARD</small>, as stated (in Gen. 21:33): <small>AND HE PLANTED A TAMARISK TREE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND HE PLANTED?</small> &#x003C; It is &#x003E; as you say (in Gen. 9:20): <small>AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD</small>. (Prov. 31:17:) <small>SHE GIRDED HER LOINS WITH VIGOR</small>, when Abraham said to her (in Gen. 18:6): <small>HURRY UP WITH THREE SEAHS OF FINE MEAL</small>&#x2026;. (Prov. 31:18:) <small>SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER MERCHANDISE WAS GOOD; AND</small> (in Gen. 21:7) <small>SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN?</small> (Prov. 31:18, cont.:) <small>HER LAMP WOULD NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT</small>. When? (In Gen. 14:15:) <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &#x003C; HIS FORCES &#x003E; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn544">15</xref></sup> (Prov. 31:21:) <small>SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW</small>. When? When the Holy One showed him Gehinnom (with its snow), she foretold that none of her children would go down into its midst. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:17): <small>THERE APPEARED A SMOKING OVEN AND A FLAMING TORCH</small>. Why? Because they fulfilled two commandments, (as shown in Prov. 31:21, cont.): <small>BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED TWOFOLD</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn545">16</xref></sup> i.e., with the Sabbath and with circumcision. (Prov. 31:22:) <small>SHE MADE COVERINGS FOR HERSELF</small>. When? When they said to him (in Gen. 18:9): <small>WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH</small>? He said to her: You have received good news that you are to bear &#x003C; children &#x003E;, and from them will go forth high priests who will serve in the Tent of Meeting. (Prov. 31:22, cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS LINEN AND PURPLE</small>, as stated (in Exod. 26:31): <small>&#x003C; AND YOU SHALL MAKE A VEIL OF &#x003E; &#x007B;LINEN&#x007D; [BLUE] AND PURPLE</small>&#x2026;. (Prov. 31:23:) <small>HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES</small>. When Sarah died, old age sprang upon Abraham and he was called elderly. Now it is stated (in Gen. 23:6, after the report of Sarah&#x2019;s death): <small>HEAR US, MY LORD, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST</small>. Ergo, <small>HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES;</small> &#x003C; and the verse continues &#x003E; immediately: <small>AS HE SAT AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND</small>. He had become old; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.</p>
<title>5.4 Genesis 24:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 24:1:) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.] Come and see: From Adam even to Abraham there are twenty generation, but there is no &#x003C; mention of &#x003E; old age written about &#x003C; any of &#x003E; them except about him.<sup><xref rid="fn546">17</xref></sup> They sired children and grandchildren, but one did not recognize which was the son and which was the father. Also the children were striking the fathers without knowing it, as stated (in Ps. 78:33): <small>SO HE ENDED THEIR DAYS IN FUTILITY AND THEIR YEARS IN TERROR</small>, because they were all alike until Abraham came along. Then the Holy One gave him this &#x003C; gray &#x003E; crown which is an ornament for when one becomes old. And when did it come over him? When he practiced righteousness, since it is stated (in Prov. 16:31): <small>GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY</small>. And how do you find it? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IT IS FOUND BY WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. To whom does this &#x003C; verse &#x003E; refer? To Abraham, concerning whom it is written (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &#x003C; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you are worthy of an old age. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Now David also received this crown, as stated (in I Kings 1:1): <small>NOW KING DAVID WAS OLD</small>. Why? Because he had acted according to Abraham&#x2019;s standard, as stated (in II Sam. 8:15): <small>AND DAVID PRACTICED JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TOWARD ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 16:31): <small>GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY</small>.</p>
<title>5.5 Genesis 24:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Three people loudly demanded three things, and from them they had their beginning. <sup><xref rid="fn547">18</xref></sup> Abraham demanded old age. Abraham said: When a father and his son enter into a city, no one knows which is the older and which is the younger. The Holy One said: You have loudly demanded old age. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. Isaac demanded afflictions. Isaac said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, when someone sins, you exact retribution from him all at once. Afflict him little by little, and you are exacting retribution from him. If you had brought afflictions upon the generation of the flood, they would not have rebelled against you. You, however, bestowed prosperity upon them. They therefore rebelled against you. Thus it is stated (in Job 12:6): <small>THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have loudly demanded afflictions. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ISAAC WAS OLD, [AND HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE]</small>. Jacob demanded illness. Jacob said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the World, one dwells in contentment. Then his life departs, and strife comes into the world. For that reason it is required for one to be in the hands of others; or, in the case of others, it is required for them to be in his hand. Now he dies suddenly and strife comes about in the world. Rather let [one] become [ill] for five or six days until he has ordained for his children everything that is necessary. Then let him depart from the world. The Holy One said to him: Jacob, you have demanded illness. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 48:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS</small> &#x007B;<small>THAT IT WAS TOLD</small>&#x007D; <small>[THAT ONE SAID] TO JOSEPH: BEHOLD, YOUR FATHER IS ILL</small>. Ergo: The three patriarchs established these three things. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.</p>
<title>5.6 Genesis 24:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>. In the beginning his name had been Abram; and now an <italic>H</italic> was added to it since he had inherited two worlds, for due to him this world and the world to come were created. R. Halafta bar Kahana said: It is written (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN THEIR BEING CREATED (<italic>HBR&#x2019;M</italic>)</small>. These are the letters which (when rearranged) spell &#x201C;Abraham.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn548">19</xref></sup> Ergo: Due to him this world and the world to come were created. &#x003C; It was &#x003E; he to whom the Holy One said (in Gen. 12:2): <small>I WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT NATION</small>. Why did he not say to him: &#x201C;I will establish you&#x201D; instead of <small>I WILL MAKE YOU?</small> R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of his father, R. Hiyya, who spoke in the name of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel and his masters on behalf of our masters in the Diaspora: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am creating you as a new creation and renovating you. (Gen. 12:2:) <small>I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am making your name &#x003C; correspond &#x003E; to the number of the members within you. Just as &#x003C; there are &#x003E; two hundred and forth-eight members &#x003C; in the human body &#x003E;, so &#x003C; the letters of &#x003E; your name (when enlarged by an &#x201C;H&#x201D;) &#x003C; shall add up to &#x003E; two hundred and forth-eight. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME, AND YOU SHALL BE A BLESSING</small>. When did he show him the blessing? In his old age, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD &#x2026; &#x003C; AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 24:1, cont.:) <small>COMING IN THE DAYS (<italic>YMYM</italic>)</small> (i.e., <small>GETTING ON IN YEARS</small>). What is the meaning of <small>COMING IN THE <italic>YMYM</italic></small>? R. Johanan said: &#x003C; Coming &#x003E; within the veil<sup><xref rid="fn549">20</xref></sup> of this world. R. Eleazar said: Of this world and the world to come. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>COMING INTO THE <italic>YMYM</italic></small>. He said to him (in Gen. 15:18): <small>TO YOUR OFFSPRING I HAVE GIVEN THIS LAND</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; I.e., &#x003E; he showed him what would happen in this world and what would happen in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn550">21</xref></sup> It is therefore written (in Gen. 24:1): <small>COMING INTO THE <italic>YMYM</italic></small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 24:1, cont.:) <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN EVERYTHING (<italic>BKL</italic>)</small>? While he was between the &#x003C; sacrificial pieces (in Gen. 15), he brought him the good news that he would give him a son fifty-two years later.<sup><xref rid="fn551">22</xref></sup> How so?<sup><xref rid="fn552">23</xref></sup> R. Johanan and R. Hanina say: At the age of forty-eight Abraham came to know his Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn553">24</xref></sup> At that time he gave him the good news that he would give him a son fifty-two years later. Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: What is the meaning of <small>IN EVERYTHING</small>? By virtue of the tithes. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:20): <small>AND HE GAVE HIM A TITHE FROM EVERYTHING</small>. Isaac also [was blessed] by virtue of the tithes. [Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND AND REAPED IN THAT YEAR A HUNDREDFOLD, FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM</small>. He also says (in Gen. 27:33): <small>AND I HAVE EATEN OF EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU CAME AND HAVE BLESSED HIM</small>. Jacob also was blessed by virtue of the tithes.] Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:22): <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 21:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 24:2:) <small>SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THE ONE WHO RULED</small>? That he controlled<sup><xref rid="fn554">25</xref></sup> [his &#x003C; evil &#x003E; drive, as stated (in II Sam. 23:3): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE RULES &#x007B;IN&#x007D; THE FEAR OF [GOD]</small>.</p>
<p>He said to him (in Gen. 24:2): <small>PLEASE PUT YOUR HAND &#x003C; UNDER MY THIGH &#x003E;</small>. See how they loved circumcision&#x0021; And Jacob also, when he had Joseph swear, said to him (in Gen. 47:29): <small>[PLEASE] PUT [YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH]</small>. For what reason did they love circumcision? Because they knew that it was going to save their children from Gehinnom in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn555">26</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Is. 5:14): <small>THEREFORE SHEOL HAS OPENED WIDE ITS GULLET [AND PARTED ITS MOUTH &#x003C; FOR ONE &#x003E; WITHOUT A STATUTE]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn556">27</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>WITHOUT A STATUTE</small>? There is no statute but circumcision. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 105:9f.): <small>&#x003C; THE COVENANT &#x003E; WHICH HE CUT WITH ABRAHAM&#x2026;. AND WHICH HE ESTABLISHED FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE</small>. But the Israelites, because they are circumcised, are saved from it. Thus it is stated (in Is. 43:2): <small>WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE WATERS, &#x003C; I WILL BE WITH YOU &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>5.7 Genesis 25:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 25:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR</small>. What is the meaning of <small>YOUR CREATOR</small>? This is the Holy One. Aqavya ben Mahalal&#x2019;el says: Look at three things [and you will not come to the point of transgression, etc.:<sup><xref rid="fn557">28</xref></sup> Where have you come from? From a fetid (seminal) drop. Where are you going? To a place of dust, worms, and maggots. Before whom are you going to render account and reckoning? Before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He.] R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: And the three of them are in this verse: <small>REMEMBER YOUR CREATOR (<italic>BWR&#x2019;K</italic>, rt.: <italic>BR</italic>&#x2019;</small>). This is the Holy One. <small>YOUR</small> &#x007B;<small>WELLS</small>&#x007D; <small>[WELL] (rt.: <italic>B&#x2019;R</italic></small>). This is a well that comes forth out of fetid (seminal) fluid. &#x007B;<small>YOUR CREATOR</small>&#x007D; <small>[YOUR PIT (BWRK)]</small> &#x003C; corresponds &#x003E; to the place where you are going to render account and reckoning.<sup><xref rid="fn558">29</xref></sup> Ergo (in Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER</small> &#x003C; all the above &#x003E;.</p>
<p>[(Eccl. 12:1, cont.:) <small>IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH</small>.] Do not wait until you have grown old, [but] (ibid., cont.): <small>BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS COME</small>. R. Isaac said: These are the days of old age,<sup><xref rid="fn559">30</xref></sup> when one intends to do something and is not able. And why are the days evil? R. Simeon ben Johay &#x003C; answered in &#x003E; a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To an individual who dwelt by the road and robbed those who passed to and fro. The king told him to repent, but he did not repent. When he grew old he said: I will make peace with the king. They said to him: The king is not grateful to you. Why? Because you did not repent willingly. Ergo (in Eccl. 12:1): <small>REMEMBER &#x003C; YOUR CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF YOUR YOUTH BEFORE THE EVIL DAYS COME &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE YEARS DRAW NEAR [WHEN YOU WILL SAY: I HAVE NO DELIGHT IN THEM]</small>. These are the afflictions (of old age).</p>
<p>(Eccl. 12:2:) <small>BEFORE [THE SUN, THE LIGHT], &#x003C; THE MOON AND THE STARS &#x003E; ARE DARKENED. [THE SUN]</small> represents the facial appearance,<sup><xref rid="fn560">31</xref></sup> <small>THE LIGHT</small> represents the eyes, <small>THE MOON</small> represents the cheeks, and <small>THE STARS</small> represent the teeth.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE CLOUDS RETURN AFTER THE RAIN</small>. When the rain comes, the clouds come; not (as one would expect), when the clouds come, the rain comes. It is simply that after one&#x2019;s eyes water, one&#x2019;s eyelids descend over them. Ergo: <small>AND THE CLOUDS RETURN &#x003C; AFTER THE RAIN &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Eccl. 12:3:) <small>IN THE DAY THAT THE GUARDS OF THE HOUSE TREMBLE</small>. These are &#x003C; the old &#x003E; one&#x2019;s knees. R. Hiyya ben Nehemiah says: These are &#x003C; the old &#x003E; one&#x2019;s bones.</p>
<p>(Ibid.,cont.:) <small>AND VALIANT ONES ARE BOWED</small>. These are &#x003C; the old &#x003E; one&#x2019;s arms.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE GRINDERS CEASE &#x003C; BECAUSE THEY ARE FEW &#x003E;</small>. These are &#x003C; the old &#x003E; one&#x2019;s teeth.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING &#x003C; THROUGH THE WINDOWS &#x003E; BECOME DIM</small>. These are the eyes. (Eccl. 12:4:) <small>AND THE DOORS TO THE STREET ARE CLOSED</small>. These are the feet. Why? When one has become old, he does not stretch his legs in the street. Thus his feet are disappearing from the street. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN THE SOUND OF THE MILL IS LOW</small>, because one tarries over the food. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ONE ARISES AT THE SOUND OF THE BIRD</small>. R. Levi b. R. Shallum said: Even though &#x003C; an old &#x003E; one hears the sound of a bird chirping, he is thinking that perhaps there are robbers.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>AND ONE ARISES AT THE SOUND OF THE BIRD</small>. Just as the offspring of a bird lean toward their father when he comes to put &#x003C; food &#x003E; in their mouths, so one &#x003C; who is old &#x003E; waits for somebody to come and put &#x003C; food &#x003E; into his mouth. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF SONG ARE BROUGHT LOW</small>. These are the lips. Thus all the days that one is a youth his voice issues forth; but when he becomes old, they (the lips) become flabby, and his voice does not travel.</p>
<p>(Eccl. 12:5:) <small>ONE ALSO IS AFRAID OF HEIGHTS</small>. They say to him: Do you wish to come and visit this sick person? He says to them: Is there a ladder there to go up? There is a steep place there. &#x003C; An old person talks so &#x003E; because he is afraid of heights.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:5): <small>ONE ALSO [IS AFRAID] OF HEIGHTS [AND TERRORS IN THE WAY]</small>. They say to him: Come and let us go to the synagogue, but he breaks up the journey and makes it little by little.</p>

But in the case of Abraham, although it is written of him (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>, his sexual desire had not ceased. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>.</p>
<title>5.8 Genesis 25:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 11:6): <small>SOW YOUR SEED IN THE MORNING, &#x003C; AND DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR HAND IN THE EVENING &#x003E;</small>, because you do not know which of them &#x007B;will protect you&#x007D; [will be made to succeed for you].<sup><xref rid="fn562">33</xref></sup> If you have learned a lot of Torah in your youth, do not become idle in your old age. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE YOU DO NOT [KNOW WHICH WILL SUCCEED]</small>. R. Joshua says: If a religious obligation presents itself to you in the morning, <small>SOW YOUR SEED</small>. Do not say no. And if [a religious obligation] presents itself to you in the evening, <small>DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR HAND IN THE EVENING, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH</small> of them will endure for you, whether that of the morning, that of the evening, (ibid., cont.): <small>OR WHETHER THEY BOTH [ARE EQUALLY GOOD]</small>. R. Aqiva says: <small>SOW YOUR SEED IN THE MORNING</small>. If you have raised up disciples in your youth, do not become idle in raising others up in your old age.<sup><xref rid="fn563">34</xref></sup> &#x003C; There is &#x003E; a story about R. Aqiva, who had three hundred disciples in his youth, and all of them died. If he had not raised &#x003C; others &#x003E; up in his old age, he would not have had a single disciple. But he had applied &#x003C; Eccl. 11:6 &#x003E; to himself: <small>SOW YOUR SEED IN THE MORNING</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: R. Dostay<sup><xref rid="fn564">35</xref></sup> said: If you take a wife who bears &#x003C; a child &#x003E; and dies, do not be idle in your old age without a wife. Why? (Eccl. 11:6:) <small>BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH WILL SUCCEED</small>. From whom do you learn &#x003C; this fact &#x003E;? From Abraham, who in his youth only sired one &#x003C; child &#x003E; but in his old age sired twelve. R. Levi said: He is the one to whom the Holy One said: (in Gen. 12:3): <small>AND IN YOU ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. Thus God arose in the generation of the dispersion and dispersed them into thirty families, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>&#x2026;. R. Levi said: The Holy One said: I am producing them out of you. He is the one to whom the Holy One had said: <small>AND IN YOU &#x003C; ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH &#x003E; SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. So from him he produced thirty families; and they are the following: twelve princes which he produced from Ishmael (Gen. 25:13-16), the sixteen descendants of Keturah (Gen. 25:1-4), and (according to Gen. 25:23) <small>TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR</small> (Rebekah&#x2019;s) <small>WOMB</small>, for a total of thirty families. Ergo (in Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE</small>.</p>
<title>5.9 Genesis 25:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>What is written before this passage (Gen. 25:1)? (Gen. 24:62:) <small>NOW ISAAC HAD COME BY WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn565">36</xref></sup> And afterwards &#x003C; it is written &#x003E; (in Gen. 25:1): <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK A WIFE AGAIN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn566">37</xref></sup> It is simply that when Isaac took Rebekah, Isaac said: Let us go and bring a wife to my father. Hagar and Keturah are the same person &#x003C; according to &#x003E; the words of Rabbi, but our masters say he took another wife. What is the logic of Rabbi? Hagar and Keturah are the same person because it is written (in Gen. 24:62): <small>NOW ISAAC HAD COME BY WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI</small>. &#x003C; Here is a reference to &#x003E; the same woman about whom it is written (in Gen. 16:14): <small>THEREFORE THE WELL WAS CALLED BEER-LAHAI-ROI</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn567">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>(Gen. 25:1:) <small>THEN ABRAHAM TOOK AN ADDITIONAL</small><sup><xref rid="fn568">39</xref></sup> <small>WIFE</small>. This text is related (to Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING, YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of R. Eleazar: You learn from here that an addition of the Holy One is more than the original.<sup><xref rid="fn569">40</xref></sup> Abraham had previously sired no one but Isaac. When the Holy One made an addition for him, he made his addition &#x003C; even &#x003E; more, as stated (in Gen. 25:2): <small>AND SHE BORE HIM &#x003C; ZIMRAN, JOKSHAN, MEDAN, MIDIAN, ISHBAK, AND SHUAH &#x003E;</small>. Thus you find in the case of the first Adam that when &#x003C; Eve &#x003E; gave birth, she bore Cain (Gen. 4:1). Then afterwards (in Gen. 4:2): <small>AND IN ADDITION SHE BORE &#x003C; HIS BROTHER ABEL &#x003E;</small>. And so you find in the case of Rachel that she bore Joseph and said (in Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. He added Benjamin for her and his twin sister. Where is it shown to be so? Here (in Gen. 35:17), &#x003C; where &#x003E; &#x201C;This is a son for you&#x201D; is not written, but <small>FOR THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU</small>. And so you find in the case of King Hezekiah, all the days of his reign were fourteen years; but when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. (Is. 38:5; cf. II Kings 20:6:) <small>SEE, I AM ADDING [FIFTEEN YEARS] TO YOUR LIFE</small>. Now when the prophets saw that an addition of the Holy One was more than the original, they began to bless Israel with an addition. Moses said (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD [GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS] ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES [MORE THAN YOU ARE]</small>&#x2026;. David said (in Ps. 115:14): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS</small>. Also in the world to come the Holy One has procured an addition (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>) for his people, as stated (in Is. 11:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME &#x003C; TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE &#x003E;</small>.</p>

<title>6.1 Genesis 25:19ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 25:19:) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISAAC BEN ABRAHAM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn570">1</xref></sup> This text is related (to Prov. 17:6): <small>GRANDCHILDREN ARE A CROWN FOR ELDERS, AND THE GLORY OF CHILDREN IS THEIR PARENTS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn571">2</xref></sup> Who caused Abraham to be magnified? Jacob, as stated (in Is. 29:22): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH REDEEMED ABRAHAM</small>. Why? Because, if one is meritorious as a Torah scholar together with his son and his grandson, it will never again be cut off from him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:9f.): <small>AND MAKE THEM (the statutes and ordinances) KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD &#x003C; BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB &#x003E;</small>. Just as the gift of &#x003C; the &#x003E; Torah did not become cease on the day it was given; so for one who teaches his son and his grandson Torah, it shall never again depart from him. And so it was when the Holy One saw Abraham was busy with the Torah. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &#x003C; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY LAWS &#x003E;</small>. It is also written (above, in 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE KNOWN HIM</small>. Then Jacob arose up and did not move from the Torah, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small> (i.e., in the academies).<sup><xref rid="fn572">3</xref></sup> What stipulation did the Holy One make with them? (According to Josh. 1:8:) <small>&#x003C; THIS &#x003E; BOOK OF THE LAW SHALL NOT DEPART &#x003C; FROM YOUR MOUTH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It is also written (in Prov. 10:1): <small>A WISE SON SHALL MAKE A FATHER GLAD</small>. This is Isaac, since it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): <small>FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED</small>. (Prov. 10:1, cont.:) <small>BUT A FOOLISH SON</small>. This is Ishmael. Thus it is written (in Gen. 25:12): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL BEN ABRAHAM</small>. There are children who suffer disgrace through their parents. Josiah suffered disgrace through his father, as stated (in II Chron. 33:23): <small>FOR AMON INCURRED A LOT OF GUILT</small>. Hezekiah suffered disgrace through &#x003C; his father &#x003E; Ahaz, as stated (in Is. 8:16): <small>BIND UP THE TESTIMONY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn573">4</xref></sup> There are also parents who suffer disgrace through their children. Eli suffered disgrace through his sons, [as stated (in I Sam. 2:12): <small>NOW ELI&#x2019;S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS</small>. And Samuel also suffered disgrace through his sons], as stated (in I Sam. 8:3): <small>BUT HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS</small>. It did not, however, turn out in this way for Abraham. Instead he was magnified through Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:19, cont.): <small>ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC</small>. Did he sire no one but Isaac? Now look, it is written &#x007B;(in Gen. 25:19): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL</small>.&#x007D; [(in Gen. 16:15): <small>SO HAGAR BORE A SON TO ABRAM</small>.] And in addition &#x003C; there are &#x003E; the sons of Keturah: Zimran and Jokshan, &#x003C; etc. &#x003E; (cf. Gen. 25:2). But it does not say that Abraham sired anyone but Isaac, simply because Isaac was righteous. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:19): <small>ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;(Gen. 26:1:) <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE</small>. This verse is related (to Prov. 18:3): <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING</small>. Who was this &#x003C; wicked &#x003E; one? This was Esau the Wicked, who came upon his feet to Abbadon (i.e., to hell, the place of damnation).

Berekhyah the Priest said: R. Levi said:<sup><xref rid="fn575">6</xref></sup> Both of them went to the elementary school, and both of them were equal until the age of fifteen. To what were they comparable? To a myrtle and a thorny plant.<sup><xref rid="fn576">7</xref></sup> As long as they are small, no one &#x003C; can &#x003E; distinguish one from the other. After they have grown up, the one awakens (in bloom), <small>AND</small> (in the words of Gen. 1:12) <small>IT WAS GOOD</small>; but the other brings forth its thorns. Thus, so long as Esau and Jacob were small no one distinguished between them. After they were grown up, they were distinguishable. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>WHEN THE BOYS GREW UP&#x2026;. JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small> (of learning).<sup><xref rid="fn577">8</xref></sup> &#x003C; But what about Esau? (According to ibid.:) <small>ESAU BECAME &#x003E; A CUNNING HUNTER, &#x003C; A MAN OF THE FIELD (<italic>SDH</italic>) &#x003E;</small>. R. Abbahu said: What is the meaning of <small>CUNNING HUNTER</small>? That his hunting was by entrapment (<italic>SWDN</italic>&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn578">9</xref></sup> He hunted at home [and he hunted] in the field. <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS</small>. The Holy One said to him: You are the first to sit in the tents (of learning). By your life, when I return to Jerusalem, I will return through your virtue. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 30:18): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: BEHOLD, I AM RESTORING JACOB&#x2019;S TENTS FROM CAPTIVITY</small>. &#x201C;Abraham&#x2019;s tents from captivity&#x201D; is not stated &#x003C; here &#x003E;, but <small>JACOB&#x2019;S TENTS FROM CAPTIVITY</small>.</p>
<title>6.3 Genesis 25:19ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 25:29:) <small>NOW JACOB HAD BOILED &#x003C; A STEW &#x003E;</small>. Esau came in from the field and saw that Jacob&#x2019;s face was blackened. He said to him: What are you doing? He said to him: Do you not know that our grandfather Abraham is dead, and I am cooking food?<sup><xref rid="fn579">10</xref></sup> Now he was going to prepare the mourner&#x2019;s meal on his behalf. Esau said to him: My friend and my enemy, &#x003C; both &#x003E; alike have died. Abraham has died, and Nimrod has died. <small>SO (according to Gen. 25:32) WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small> What was he cooking? Lentils, because from ancient times they had brought lentils (on account of) [unto] the mourner and lentils to the house with a wedding. (Gen. 25:29:) <small>THEN ESAU CAME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn580">11</xref></sup> They have said: This wicked man committed three transgressions on that day. He robbed, since it is written (of Edom in Obad. 5): <small>IF THIEVES HAVE COME TO YOU, PLUNDERERS (rt.: <italic>ShDD</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn581">12</xref></sup> OF THE NIGHT</small>. He also seduced a maiden who was betrothed, as stated (in Gen. 25:7): <small>&#x003C; EDOM BECAME A MAN &#x003E; OF THE FIELD</small>. A field is nothing but a maiden, since it is stated (in Deut. 22:25): <small>IF IN THE FIELD [THE MAN FINDS A MAIDEN] &#x003C; WHO IS BETROTHED, AND THE MAN SEIZES HER AND LIES WITH HER &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And he took a life, since it is stated (in Gen. 25:29): <small>AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED. EXHAUSTED</small> can only &#x003C; imply &#x003E; &#x201C;killing.&#x201D; Thus it is stated (in Jer. 4:31): <small>WOE UNTO ME, NOW&#x0021; FOR MY LIFE IS EXHAUSTED BEFORE THOSE WHO KILL</small>.</p>
<p>The Holy One said: I made a stipulation with Abraham (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE; YOU SHALL BE BURIED AT A GOOD OLD AGE</small>. Now this was a good end; for when one who is righteous passes away, they say to him: Look at what your grandson is doing&#x0021; David said (in Ps. 63:4 [3]): <small>FOR YOUR STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE</small>. Therefore, Abraham passed away because of Esau. You know yourself that it is so. Isaac, who came from the fecundity of Abraham, lived to one hundred and eighty; but Abraham only lived to one hundred and seventy-five. The Holy One said: Lest he see Esau committing transgressions and voice a complaint over him, for that reason, let five years be deducted from the life of Abraham.</p>
<title>6.4 Genesis 25:19ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 25:30:) <small>PLEASE LET ME GULP DOWN SOME OF THIS RED RED STUFF</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>? R. Johanan said: From you and from those like you, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; from the righteous who are like you.<sup><xref rid="fn582">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>. &#x201C;Give me&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>LET ME GULP DOWN</small>. He said to him: <small>LET ME GULP DOWN &#x003C; SOME &#x003E;</small>. He gave him &#x003C; some &#x003E; in a saucer. He said: You are giving it to me in a saucer. Pour from the pot &#x003C; directly &#x003E; into my mouth. Now the word for &#x201C;gulping down&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>L&#x2018;T</italic>) is nothing but the word for &#x201C;pouring&#x201D;; for so have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab</italic>. 24:3): <small>ONE DOES NOT STUFF THE CAMEL NOR CRAM IT BUT FEEDS IT FULLY (rt.: <italic>L&#x2018;T</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn583">14</xref></sup> He therefore said (in Gen. 25:30): <small>LET ME GULP DOWN (in the sense of POUR INTO ME</small>).</p>
<p>(Gen. 25:31:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID: SELL ME YOUR BIRTHRIGHT FOR TODAY</small>. He said to him: Are you requesting my birthright? Do you request my share in the world to come? He said to him: I do not know whether you have a share in the world to come, but sell me the birthright since it is public knowledge<sup><xref rid="fn584">15</xref></sup> <small>FOR TODAY. SELL&#x2026; FOR TODAY (<italic>KYWM</italic>):</small> R. Aha said: Whoever knows how to &#x007B;reply&#x007D; [calculate] properly, knows that Israel received &#x003C; the birthright &#x003E; in this world only for a thousand years, because a day (<italic>YWM</italic>) for the Holy One is a thousand years. It is so stated (in Ps. 90:4): <small>FOR A THOUSAND YEARS &#x003C; IN YOUR EYES ARE LIKE THE DAY (<italic>KYWM</italic>) WHICH IS YESTERDAY &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn585">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 25:32:) <small>AND ESAU SAID: LOOK, I AM GOING TO DIE</small>. Abraham is dead; yet the Holy Spirit says (in Jer. 22:10): <small>DO NOT WEEP FOR ONE WHO IS DEAD</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>WEEP BITTERLY FOR ONE WHO IS GOING AWAY</small>. (Gen. 25:32, cont.:) <small>SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small> Now the Holy Spirit says (in Ps. 109:17): <small>SINCE HE LOVED A CURSE, IT HAS COME UPON HIM; SINCE HE DID NOT FIND PLEASURE IN BLESSING, IT IS FAR FROM HIM</small>. How did the first-born sacrifice? (<italic>Zev</italic>. 14:4:) <small>BEFORE THE TABERNACLE WAS ERECTED &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE WAS &#x003C; PERFORMED &#x003E; BY THE FIRST-BORN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn586">17</xref></sup> Moreover, everyone who offered sacrifice was worthy of being blessed, as stated (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL MAKE ME &#x003E; AN ALTAR OF EARTH&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I HAVE MY NAME MENTIONED &#x003E; I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. Esau said: This man wants neither to sacrifice nor to be blessed. The prophet said to him (in Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD; SO BLOOD SHALL PURSUE YOU</small>. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hanina ben Hama: This is the blood of the sacrifices which he hated to sacrifice to the Holy One. But our masters say: This is the blood of circumcision, since he stretched his foreskin (to undo his circumcision). Thus it is stated (in Ps. 55:21 [20]): <small>HE HAS PUT FORTH HIS HAND AGAINST HIS WHOLENESS AND PROFANED HIS COVENANT</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD</small>. Now Esau hated blood. His father had blessed him through blood, and he had confidence in blood, as stated (in Gen. 27:40): <small>YET BY YOUR SWORD YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. Still it &#x003C; actually &#x003E; says to him (in Ezek. 35:6): <small>SURELY YOU HAVE HATED BLOOD</small>&#x0021; It is simply that he hated a person&#x2019;s life while it was placed in his body. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:32, end): <small>SO WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME?</small></p>
<p>(Gen. 25:34:) <small>SO ESAU DESPISED</small>. &#x003C; He was &#x003E; of the opinion that he was joking with Jacob, but the Holy One gave his concurrence from above.<sup><xref rid="fn587">18</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 25:34:) <small>SO ESAU DESPISED &#x003C; HIS BIRTHRIGHT &#x003E;</small>. (Prov. 18:3:) <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING</small>. This refers to Esau, about whom it is stated: <small>SO ESAU DESPISED</small>. (Prov. 18:3, cont.:) &#x007B;<small>AND WHEN DISGRACE COMES</small>&#x007D;, <small>[AND WITH DISGRACE, SHAME]</small>, since the famine came in his footsteps. Thus it is stated (immediately after the verse about Esau despising his birthright, in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.</p>
<title>6.5 Genesis 26:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>[(Gen. 26:1:) <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn588">19</xref></sup> It is speaking about Abraham, of whom it is read that he feared God. Thus it is stated (of Abraham in Gen. 22:12): <small>THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE</small>, since &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; was waiting for the Holy One, for this reason: (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR LIFE FROM DEATH</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; from his execution by Nimrod. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, the one which came in his days, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &#x003C; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>. This &#x003C; refers to &#x003E; Jacob. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE</small>, since Jacob waited for the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn589">20</xref></sup> (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; from his execution by Esau, who said (in Gen. 27:41): <small>LET THE DAYS OF [MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB]</small>. (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, the one which came in his days.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &#x003C; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>. This &#x003C; refers to &#x003E; the tribe of Levi, of whom it is stated (in Mal. 2:5): <small>AND I GAVE THEM</small> (i.e., life and peace) <small>TO HIM</small><sup><xref rid="fn590">21</xref></sup> (i.e., Levi) <small>AS WELL AS FEAR, [AND HE FEARED ME]</small>. (Ps. 33:18, cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT</small>, since they were always waiting for the Holy One. (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, when they enter &#x003C; the Sanctuary &#x003E; to offer sacrifice. (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, since he has given them a tithe, as stated (in Numb. 18:26): <small>NOW &#x003C; YOU SHALL SPEAK &#x003E; UNTO THE LEVITES &#x003C; AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE TITHES FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &#x003C; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>, because it says (in Cant. 8:14): <small>FLEE, MY BELOVED, AND BECOME LIKE A GAZELLE</small>. Just as this gazelle sleeps with one eye open and one closed, so also &#x003C; let it be with &#x003E; you: <small>AND BECOME LIKE A GAZELLE</small>. Therefore David has said (in Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD (like that of a gazelle) IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Ps. 33:18): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD &#x003C; IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM &#x003E;</small>.] This is Isaac. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT</small>, since he was waiting for the Holy One. (Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>, when Ishmael sought to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 21:9): <small>THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN PLAYING</small>. Now <small>PLAYING</small> can only mean &#x201C;killing.&#x201D; Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY BEFORE US</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn591">22</xref></sup> (Ps. 33:19, cont.:) <small>TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN THE FAMINE</small>, since the famine did come in his days, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND</small>.</p>
<title>6.6 Genesis 26:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 26:1, cont.:) <small>AND ISAAC WENT TO ABIMELECH</small>&#x2026;. He had wanted to go down to Egypt, &#x003C; but &#x003E; the Holy One immediately appeared to him. He said to him (in vs. 2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. Abraham went down &#x003C; there &#x003E;, but Isaac did not go down. Now why did he say, not to Abraham, but only to Isaac: <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>? R. Hosha&#x2019;ya said: The Holy One said unto Isaac: Because your father came to the land from abroad, he went down to Egypt; but, since you were born in the land of Israel and &#x003C; represent &#x003E; a pure burnt offering, how could you be going down?<sup><xref rid="fn592">23</xref></sup> Ergo (in Gen. 26:2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 26:3:) <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND</small>. R. Hanan said in the name of R. Samuel b. R. Isaac: Why &#x003C; was such a command necessary &#x003E;? He would not have wanted to become unclean outside the land. &#x003C; He wanted to leave &#x003E; because a decree had been issued, as stated (in Gen. 26:1): <small>NOW THERE WAS A FAMINE</small>. It therefore says (in vs. 3): <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: In this world the righteous have been rejected (rt.: <italic>TRP</italic>), as stated (in Ps. 111:5): <small>HE HAS GIVEN <italic>teref</italic> (rt.: <italic>TRP</italic>)</small><sup><xref rid="fn593">24</xref></sup> <small>TO THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>; but in the world to come, (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIS COVENANT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn594">25</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.7 Genesis 27:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>Thus has R. Tanhuma interpreted (Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &#x003C; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &#x003E;</small>. You find that there are twenty generations from Adam to Abraham, and there is no &#x003C; mention of &#x003E; old age written about &#x003C; any of &#x003E; them except Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn595">26</xref></sup> Isaac arose, &#x003C; and &#x003E; it is also written (in Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD</small>. Jacob arose, &#x003C; and &#x003E; it is also written (in Gen. 48:10): <small>NOW ISRAEL&#x2019;S EYES WERE DIM WITH AGE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 90:16): <small>LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN</small>. Now <small>GLORY</small> can only be old age and gray hair, as stated (in Prov. 20:29): <small>THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNG IS THEIR STRENGTH; BUT THE GLORY OF THE OLD IS GRAY HAIR</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 90:16): <small>AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN</small>. &#x003C; These words mean &#x003E; that Abraham endowed Isaac with five things. Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>&#x2018;Eduy</italic>. 2:9): <small>A FATHER ENDOWS HIS SON WITH FIVE THINGS: WITH BEAUTY, WITH STRENGTH, WITH WEALTH, WITH WISDOM, AND WITH &#x003C; LENGTH OF &#x003E; YEARS</small>. How is it shown about <small>BEAUTY</small>? In that Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): <small>NOW JOSEPH WAS WELL BUILT</small>. Also, when he went to his brothers, they said (in Gen. 37:19): <small>HERE COMES THIS</small> (<italic>hallazeh</italic>) <small>DREAMER</small>. It is also said of Isaac (in Gen. 24:65): <small>WHO IS THIS</small> (<italic>hallazeh</italic>) <small>MAN &#x003C; WALKING IN THE FIELD TO MEET US &#x003E;</small>? Thus Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. How is it shown that Isaac was mighty in <small>STRENGTH</small>? Look at how many wells he dug&#x0021; Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:18-22): <small>THEN ISAAC REDUG &#x003C; THE WELLS OF WATER &#x003E;&#x2026;. AND ISAAC&#x2019;S SERVANTS DUG&#x2026;. AND THEY DUG ANOTHER WELL&#x2026;. THEN HE MOVED FROM THERE AND DUG &#x003C; ANOTHER WELL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Look at the power which he had&#x0021; Where is it shown about <small>WEALTH?</small> Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:13): <small>AND THE MAN GREW &#x003C; RICHER AND RICHER &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It also says (in vs. 14): <small>AND HE POSSESSED FLOCKS &#x003C; AND HERDS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Where is it shown about <small>WISDOM?</small> Where he said to his father (in Gen. 22:7 at the time of his being bound): <small>HERE ARE THE FIRE AND THE WOOD</small>&#x2026;. [How is it shown] about <small>&#x003C; LENGTH OF &#x003E; YEARS</small>? In that he was one hundred and eighty years old &#x003C; when he died &#x003E;, while Abraham was &#x003C; only &#x003E; one hundred and seventy-five. On account of these five things &#x007B;through which he had attained merit&#x007D;, five years more than his father&#x2019;s were added to him. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 90:16): <small>LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS</small>&#x2026;. Anyone who has merit is meritorious in these five things, and anyone who does not have merit is not meritorious and receives five retributions that correspond to them.<sup><xref rid="fn596">27</xref></sup> And who is this anyone? This is Joab, of whom it is stated (in II Sam. 3:29): <small>MAY IT (Abner&#x2019;s blood) FALL UPON THE HEAD OF JOB AND HIS SON;</small><sup><xref rid="fn597">28</xref></sup> <small>[MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE, ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD]. ONE WITH A DISCHARGE</small> corresponds to <small>STRENGTH</small>. In the case of one who has a discharge, there is no one weaker than he. <small>A LEPER</small> corresponds to <small>BEAUTY</small>. In the case of one who is a leper, even a young &#x003C; leper &#x003E;, there is no one more ugly than he. <small>A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE</small> corresponds to <small>WEALTH</small>; for he [is one] &#x007B;like a poor woman is one&#x007D; who, if not spinning flax, has nothing of which to eat. <small>ONE LACKING BREAD</small> corresponds to <small>WISDOM</small>, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. And <small>ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD</small> corresponds to <small>&#x003C; LENGTH OF &#x003E; YEARS</small>. The one who sins is afflicted by them, but the one who is meritorious receives, as did Isaac. David also gave praise (in Ps. 45:17 [16]): <small>INSTEAD OF YOUR PARENTS THERE WILL BE YOUR CHILDREN</small>.</p>
<title>6.8 Genesis 27:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &#x003C; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 17:8): <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE OF GRACE (i.e., A PRECIOUS STONE) IN THE EYES OF THE ONE USING IT; WHEREVER HE TURNS, HE PROSPERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn598">29</xref></sup> Do not say it this way (i.e., with the word <small>GRACE</small>), but <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE IN THE EYES OF THE ONE USING IT</small>. Come and see what the Holy One&#x2019;s burnt offering (i.e., Isaac at his binding) has said: It is not seemly for him to be weak in the eyes. Should one who would give his life for the name of the Holy One and was bound upon the altar have had his eyes weakened? Nevertheless, the Holy One said: I have written in my Torah (in Exod. 23:8): <small>AND DO NOT TAKE A BRIBE</small>. Why? (Deut. 16:19:) <small>BECAUSE A BRIBE BLINDS THE EYES OF THE WISE</small>. So, when he received a bribe from Esau, I weakened his eyes. Now surely, if Isaac the Righteous had his eyes weakened because he took a bribe, how much the worse is it for &#x003C; just &#x003E; anyone who receives a bribe from others&#x0021; It is therefore stated (in Prov. 7:8): <small>A BRIBE IS A STONE OF GRACE</small>. Therefore (in Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD AND &#x003C; HIS EYES &#x003E; WERE TOO WEAK &#x003C; TO SEE &#x003E;</small>. The word &#x201C;deception&#x201D; was not mentioned here.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:1, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM (Esau): MY SON; AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: HERE I AM</small>. The Holy Spirit also proclaims (in Prov. 26:25): <small>WHEN HIS (Esau&#x2019;s) VOICE IS GRACIOUS, DO NOT TRUST HIM; FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn599">30</xref></sup> &#x003C; I.e., &#x003E; seven sanctuaries are going to be destroyed: the Tent of Meeting, Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, Gibeon, the first Temple, and the second Temple. Ergo: <small>FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: He will slay the ten tribes and the kings of Israel. Here are two. He will slay the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to make four. He will slay the priests, the Levites, and the dynasty of the house of David, for a total of seven.</p>
<title>6.9 Genesis 27:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:1): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM (Esau): MY SON; AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: HERE I AM</small>. Solomon proclaimed (in Prov. 26:23): <small>SILVER DROSS LAID OVER EARTHENWARE ARE BURNING LIPS AND AN EVIL HEART</small>. To what was Esau comparable? To a caldron<sup><xref rid="fn600">31</xref></sup> with an outside of gold inlaid with pearls but an inside of earthenware. [Thus did Esau say to his father: <small>HERE I AM</small>, while in his heart he was saying: When will he die?] Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:41): <small>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 26:23): <small>SILVER DROSS LAID OVER EARTHENWARE</small>&#x2026;. And so you find that the seed of [Esau], Haman, said in his heart (in Esth. 6:6): <small>NOW HAMAN SAID IN HIS HEART</small>. (Is. 14:13f.:) <small>THE FOOL HAS SAID IN HIS HEART: &#x003C; THERE IS NO GOD &#x003E;</small>. (Is. 14:13:) <small>AND YOU SAID IN YOUR HEART: I WILL ASCEND TO THE HEAVENS&#x2026;. &#x003C; I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH &#x003E;</small>. (Ezek. 38:10:) <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY THAT THOUGHTS SHALL COME UPON YOUR HEART, &#x003C; AND YOU WILL DEVISE AN EVIL DESIGN &#x003E;</small>. (Ps. 10:11:) <small>HE HAS SAID IN HIS HEART: GOD HAS FORGOTTEN</small>. (Is. 47:8:) <small>AND NOW</small> &#x007B;<small>PLEASE</small>&#x007D; <small>HEAR [THIS]</small>, &#x007B;<small>YOU</small>&#x007D; <small>ELEGANT WOMAN WHO DWELLS IN SECURITY, WHO SAYS IN HER HEART: [I AM, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE]</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 26:25): <small>FOR THERE ARE SEVEN ABOMINATIONS IN HIS HEART</small>; and Solomon proclaimed (in Prov. 26:23): <small>SILVER DROSS &#x003C; LAID OVER EARTHENWARE ARE BURNING LIPS AND AN EVIL HEART &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.10 Genesis 27:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:3:) <small>NOW THEN, PLEASE TAKE YOUR IMPLEMENTS, &#x003C; YOUR QUIVER AND YOUR BOW, AND GO OUT TO THE FIELD &#x003E;</small>. R. Isaac the Smith said: <small>[YOUR IMPLEMENTS]</small> alludes to the Kingdom of Babylon.<sup><xref rid="fn601">32</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Dan. 1:2): <small>THEN THE LORD GAVE KING JEHOIAKIM OF JUDAH INTO HIS HAND, WITH SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTS FROM THE HOUSE OF GOD. YOUR QUIVER</small> (<italic>teli</italic>) alludes to [the kingdom of] Media. Thus it is stated (in Esth. 9:25): <small>SO THEY (the Medes and the Persians) HANGED (<italic>talu</italic>) HIM (Haman) AND HIS SONS ON THE TREE. AND YOUR BOW</small> alludes to Greece.<sup><xref rid="fn602">33</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Zech. 9:13): <small>FOR I WILL BEND JUDAH TO ME; A BOW &#x003C; I WILL FILL WITH EPHRAIM; I WILL STIR UP YOUR CHILDREN, O ZION, AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF GREECE &#x003E;. AND GO OUT TO THE FIELD</small> alludes to Edom.<sup><xref rid="fn603">34</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:4 [3]): <small>TO THE LAND OF SEIR, THE FIELD OF EDOM</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:4f.:) <small>AND MAKE ME DELICACIES&#x2026;. NOW REBEKAH HAD BEEN LISTENING&#x2026;. [THEN ESAU WENT TO THE FIELD]</small>. When he had caught &#x003C; some deer &#x003E; and bound them, the angel went to set them free and drive them away.<sup><xref rid="fn604">35</xref></sup> Again he caught them, but the angel set them free. And why so? Simply to drag out the hours until Jacob would go. So he would go, make &#x003C; the meal &#x003E;, enter in with his father, eat, and receive the blessings. Ergo (in Gen. 27:5): <small>THEN ESAU WENT TO THE FIELD TO CATCH GAME TO BRING &#x003C; HOME &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:6, 8, &#x0026; 9:) <small>AND REBEKAH SPOKE UNTO JACOB&#x2026;. AND NOW MY SON, HEED ME IN WHAT &#x003C; I CHARGE YOU &#x003E;. PLEASE GO TO THE FLOCK</small>&#x2026;. As soon as Esau had gone to get &#x003C; the venison &#x003E;, he (Jacob) went to his father, as stated (in Gen. 27:18 &#x0026; 19): <small>THEN HE WENT UNTO HIS FATHER&#x2026;. AND JACOB SAID UNTO HIS FATHER: &#x003C; I AM ESAU, YOUR FIRST-BORN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. So he blessed him (in Gen. 27:27). Even though you may say Jacob lied, he did not lie. Balaam said (in Numb. 23:21): <small>NO ONE HAS BEHELD FALSEHOOD IN JACOB</small>. [He said] merely (in Gen. 27:19 &#x0026;. 20): I am Jacob; <small>ESAU [IS] YOUR FIRST-BORN&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn605">36</xref></sup> PLEASE ARISE; SIT UP &#x003C; AND EAT &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN ISAAC SAID UNTO HIS SON: &#x003C; HOW IS IT THAT YOU WERE SO QUICK &#x003E;</small> &#x2026; ? He said to him (in Gen. 27:20, cont.): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD MADE IT HAPPEN FOR ME</small>. Then in addition he said to him:<sup><xref rid="fn606">37</xref></sup> When you were bound upon the altar, the angel said (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>. Perhaps there was something there. The Holy One only caused &#x003C; a sacrificial animal &#x003E; to sprout forth for your sake, as stated (in Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES &#x003C; TO LOOK, AND THERE WAS A RAM BEHIND HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. So also he said (here in Gen. 27:20): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD MADE IT HAPPEN FOR ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn607">38</xref></sup> Now, when Isaac heard him say: <small>BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD MADE IT HAPPEN FOR ME</small>, he said: This is not Esau. He said: Esau never mentions <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. He said to him (in vss. 21f.): <small>PLEASE COME NEARER AND LET ME TOUCH YOU, MY SON&#x2026;. SO JACOB CAME NEARER TO HIS FATHER ISAAC</small>&#x2026;. He said to him: Behold, in voice you are Jacob;<sup><xref rid="fn608">39</xref></sup> <small>BUT</small> (in vs. 22, cont.) <small>THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>. R. Judah bar Il&#x2019;ay said:<sup><xref rid="fn609">40</xref></sup> In former generations one would ask: What is the meaning (of Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>? The voice of the Emperor<sup><xref rid="fn610">41</xref></sup> Hadrian, &#x003C; who &#x003E; [killed] eight thousand myriads (80,000,000) in Bethther.<sup><xref rid="fn611">42</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: The voice of Jacob was crying out &#x003C; over &#x003E; what the hands of Esau did to him in Bethther.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:23:) <small>SO HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM BECAUSE HIS HANDS WERE &#x003C; HAIRY LIKE THE HANDS OF HIS BROTHER ESAU &#x003E;</small>. He (Isaac) foresaw that the wicked ones were going to arise from him; and he did not want to bless him &#x007B;since he foresaw Jakum.<sup><xref rid="fn612">43</xref></sup> When Jerusalem was conquered, the world said: They are afraid to enter into the Temple. What did he do? He entered and brought &#x003C; out &#x003E; the menorah. When &#x003C; Isaac &#x003E; saw him, he did not want to bless Jacob on his account. <small>SO HE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM</small>&#x007D;. When he foresaw that he would repent, there immediately follows (in vs. 27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS CLOTHES AND BLESSED HIM</small>&#x2026;. When Jacob entered, the Garden of Eden (i.e., Paradise) entered with him, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>LIKE THE ODOR OF A FIELD WHICH THE LORD HAS BLESSED</small>. When Esau entered, Gehinnom entered with him. Thus it is stated (in vs. 33): <small>WHO IS EPHO</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn613">44</xref></sup> Now <small>EPHO</small> can only be Gehinnom, since it is stated (in Is. 22:16): <small>THAT YOU HAVE HEWN A TOMB HERE (<italic>poh</italic>) FOR YOURSELF</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:27): <small>LIKE THE ODOR OF A FIELD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn614">45</xref></sup> He foresaw that he was going to build Zion and offer sacrifices in its midst; so he blessed him. Now <small>A FIELD</small> can only be Zion, since it is stated (in Micah 3:12): <small>ZION SHALL BE PLOWED AS A FIELD</small>. (Gen. 27:27, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; A FIELD &#x003E; WHICH THE LORD HAS BLESSED</small>. That is what he wrote about (in Ps. 133:3): <small>LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON &#x003C; WHICH COMES DOWN UPON THE HILLS OF ZION &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.11 Genesis 27:28ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY THE GOD GIVE TO YOU &#x003C; FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN &#x003E;</small>. &#x007B;His fulfillment is simply &#x003C; that of &#x003E; God. In that my fulfillment belongs to God,&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn615">46</xref></sup> [&#x201C;A God&#x201D; is not written here but <small>THE GOD</small>. When the God accomplishes his fulfillment], he will give you the blessings with which I have blessed you. Why? Because Jacob was collaborating with his Creator in every matter. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said in the name of R. Reuben: Look at what is written (in Jer. 10:16): <small>NOT LIKE THESE (idols) IS THE PORTION (i.e., the God) OF JACOB, FOR HE HAS FORMED EVERYTHING, &#x003C; AND ISRAEL IS THE TRIBE OF HIS INHERITANCE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>David also gives praise<sup><xref rid="fn616">47</xref></sup> (in Ps. 110:3): <small>YOUR PEOPLE OFFER THEMSELVES FREELY IN YOUR DAY OF VALOR</small>. Now where is it shown that the righteous were collaborators with the Holy One when he formed a model? Where it is so written (in I Chron. 4:23): <small>THESE WERE THE FORMERS, [EVEN] THE INHABITANTS OF NETAIM</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; These are &#x003E; [the ones who are] collaborators with God in all creation, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEY DWELL THERE ALONG WITH THE KING AT HIS WORK</small>; i.e., they dwell along with the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, at his work, and create creation. The Holy One said: It is not enough that I do nothing without their knowledge, but everything which I make in this world and in the world to come is prepared for them. That is what David said (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.12 Genesis 27:28ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is it correct that one may fold his garments on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab</italic>. 15:3): <small>ONE MAY FOLD GARMENTS EVEN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES. ONE MAY ALSO MAKE BEDS ON THE NIGHT OF THE SABBATH (i.e., on Friday night) FOR THE SABBATH, BUT NOT ON THE SABBATH FOR THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE SABBATH</small>. Now concerning these garments, they said that one may fold any garments that one is to wear on the Sabbath; but &#x003C; as for those &#x003E; to be worn after the Sabbath, it is forbidden to fold them on the Sabbath. Also with respect to garments which are folded by two people, it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn617">48</xref></sup> In the case of an individual, it is permitted to fold one. And he should not be apprehensive, because one should honor the Sabbath with his clothes, as stated (in Is. 68:13): <small>AND YOU SHALL CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn618">49</xref></sup> And in what way does Israel honor the Sabbath? Through eating, through drinking, and through clean clothes, because the Holy One did so from the beginning, as stated (in Gen. 3:21): <small>THEN [THE LORD] GOD MADE TUNICS OF SKIN FOR ADAM AND HIS WIFE AND CLOTHED THEM</small>. What were <small>TUNICS OF SKIN?</small> [Garments] of high priesthood, which the Holy One put on them, since he (Adam) was the glory of the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our masters have also taught (in <italic>Zev</italic>. 14:4) <small>BEFORE THE TABERNACLE WAS SET UP, THE HIGH PLACES WERE PERMITTED AND THE SACRIFICIAL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED BY THE FIRST-BORN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn619">50</xref></sup> Therefore, the Holy One clothed Adam in garments of high priesthood, since he was the first-born of the world. Noah came [and passed them on to Shem; Shem] passed them on to Abraham; Abraham passed them on to Isaac; and Isaac passed them on to Esau, who was his first-born. Esau, however, saw his wives serving idols and deposited them (the clothes) with his mother. When Jacob arose and took the birthright of Esau, Rebekah said: Inasmuch as Jacob has taken the birthright from the hand of Esau, he has the right to put on these garments. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>THEN REBEKAH TOOK THE BEST GARMENTS OF HER OLDER SON ESAU, &#x003C; WHICH WERE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE, AND HAD HER YOUNGER SON JACOB PUT THEM ON &#x003E;</small>. Jacob came in to his father Isaac and emitted an aroma on him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS AND BLESSED HIM</small>&#x2026;. How did he bless him? According to what they read on the matter (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.13 Genesis 27:28ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>.] It is written (in Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">51</xref></sup> Who spoke this verse? Job spoke it about himself, about the Temple, and about Jacob. In what way did he say about himself: <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN</small> &#x2026; ? The doors of his house were open to those passing by, especially to Torah scholars. What is the meaning of <small>UNTO (<italic>ele</italic>) WATER</small>? To the rams (<italic>ele</italic>) of Torah and its warriors. It is just as you say (in Dan. 8:4): <small>I SAW THE RAM CHARGING SEAWARD AND NORTHWARD</small>. [&#x201C;To water&#x201D;] is not written here (in Job 29:19), but <small>UNTO (<italic>ele</italic>) WATER</small>, because the house of Job was opened to &#x003C; such &#x003E; wayfarers. Therefore (in Job 29:19, cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES (<italic>qatsir</italic>)</small>. R. Hanina said: Everybody saw that when Job harvested his field, there were clouds gathered over his harvest (<italic>qatsir</italic>) because it would not have recovered its freshness from the burning heat.<sup><xref rid="fn621">52</xref></sup> Ergo (in Job 29:19): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES (<italic>qatsir</italic>)</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>. This refers to the Temple because its gates were open to the Torah. Thus it is stated (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small> (of Torah). &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as our masters have taught (in <italic>Sanh</italic>. 11 [10]:2):<sup><xref rid="fn622">53</xref></sup> <small>THERE WERE THREE LAW COURTS THERE: ONE AT THE OPENING TO THE TEMPLE MOUNT, ONE AT THE OPENING TO THE TEMPLE COURT, AND ONE IN THE HALL OF HEWN STONES</small>. Ergo (in Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN &#x003C; UNTO WATER (of Torah)</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. What is the meaning (of ibid., cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES</small>. That the dew does not [move] from there, as stated (in Ps. 133:3): <small>LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON &#x003C; WHICH COMES DOWN UPON THE HILLS OF ZION</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 29:19): <small>MY ROOT IS OPEN UNTO WATER</small>. This was Jacob pursuing &#x003C; the water of Torah &#x003E; in the academies which were open to the Torah. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>AND DEW SHALL LODGE ON MY BRANCHES</small>? For, when he comes to his father to receive ten blessings, he begins for <small>YOU</small> with dew (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE YOU FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.14 Genesis 27:28ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. May he give to you and give to you.<sup><xref rid="fn623">54</xref></sup> May he give to you from his own, may he give to you from what belongs to my ancestors, and may he give to you the blessing of Abraham.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GOD</small>? &#x003C; That he acted &#x003E; in justice. If you were worthy, he will give to you; but if not, he will not give to you. To Esau, however, he did not say this; but (according to Gen. 27:39): <small>OF THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH &#x003C; SHALL BE YOUR DWELLING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Whether you are righteous or wicked, he will give to you. Why? Isaac simply said this: Esau is wicked, and Jacob is righteous. Even though he performs a commandment and is afflicted, he does not voice a complaint [against divine justice. However, if the wicked one performs one commandment or prays, and is not answered, he begins to say]: Just as I have prayed to idols and found nothing tangible, [so I have prayed to God and found nothing tangible]. Solomon also said so. When he built the Temple, he prayed to the Holy One, as stated (in I Kings 8, beginning with vs. 12): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAID: THE LORD SAID THAT HE WOULD DWELL IN THICK DARKNESS</small>. He began reciting his prayers and said: Sovereign of the World, when someone from Israel comes to pray in the future and asks for sons or for something else, if he is worthy, give to him; but if not, do not give to him. Thus it is stated (in vs. 39): <small>AND GIVE TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WAYS, SINCE YOU KNOW HIS HEART</small>. But if a foreigner should come to pray there, give to him whatever he asks. Thus it is stated (in vss. 41 &#x0026; 43): <small>AND ALSO UNTO THE FOREIGNER &#x2026; YOU SHALL</small> &#x007B;<small>ALSO</small>&#x007D; <small>HEARKEN IN HEAVEN</small>&#x2026;. For perhaps, if you do not do for him all that he asks, he will talk and say to himself: So it is with this house of Solomon. I have gone from one end of the world to the other and have been worn out from so many journeyings. Then I came and prayed in here and have found nothing tangible in here, just as I did not find it in idolatry. Ergo (in Gen. 27:39): <small>SEE, OF THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH &#x003C; SHALL BE YOUR DWELLING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Why? Because he is lacking faith. But to Jacob, since he possessed faith and was righteous, he said (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; injustice.</p>
<title>6.15 Genesis 27:28ff., Part V</title>
<p>[(Gen. 27:28:) <small>SO MAY &#x003C; GOD &#x003E; GIVE TO YOU</small>.] What is written above of the matter (in Gen. 27:1, 6, 17)? <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &#x003C; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN REBEKAH SAID UNTO HER SON JACOB&#x2026;. THEN SHE GAVE HIM THE DELICACIES</small>&#x2026;. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said in the name of R. Helbo: She brought him in as far as her partition, as far as she had authority to enter.<sup><xref rid="fn624">55</xref></sup> She said to him: My son, I have accompanied you in this far. From here on your God will accompany you in. He entered as he said to him (to Isaac in Gen. 27:20): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD MADE IT HAPPEN FOR ME</small>. R. Johanan said: When he said: <small>BECAUSE THE LORD YOUR GOD MADE IT HAPPEN FOR ME</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn625">56</xref></sup> Isaac said: This language is not the language of Esau, but the language of Jacob, as stated (in vs. 22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. You know that it is so. When Jacob entered, what did he say (in vs. 19)? <small>PLEASE ARISE; SIT UP &#x003C; AND EAT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. But when Esau entered, [what did he say to him (in vs. 31)? <small>LET MY FATHER ARISE</small>. Look at] what he is saying, how he speaks with difficulty: <small>LET MY FATHER ARISE</small>&#x2026;. Isaac began saying to Jacob (in vs. 21): <small>PLEASE COME NEARER AND LET ME TOUCH YOU, &#x003C; MY SON &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R.Joshua said: When he said (in vs. 21): <small>PLEASE COME NEARER</small>, his body trembled, and he hung back like wax.<sup><xref rid="fn626">57</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He spoke to two of the angels, to Gabriel and Michael, and they assisted him, Michael to his right and Gabriel to his left, with that one in his glory, may his name be blessed, supporting him from his rear. Then he said to him: Jacob, why are you afraid, with your body buckling over upon itself? I am God. My army<sup><xref rid="fn627">58</xref></sup> &#x003C; has come &#x003E; to help you, and they are supporting you. Still, you are afraid&#x0021; Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:10): <small>FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU; BE NOT DISMAYED, FOR I AM YOUR GOD. I STRENGTHEN YOU, I ALSO HELP YOU, AND I UPHOLD YOU WITH MY VICTORIOUS RIGHT HAND. FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU</small>. Let not your body sink down, <small>FOR I AM WITH YOU. BE NOT DISMAYED, FOR I AM YOUR GOD. I STRENGTHEN YOU</small> with Michael. <small>I ALSO HELP YOU</small> with Gabriel. <small>AND I UPHOLD YOU WITH MY VICTORIOUS RIGHT HAND</small>. Immediately [Isaac] said to him (in Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>. Your power is stronger than his. If Esau captures anyone, see, he is in his hand; but if [that one] flees, he cannot do a thing to him. With you, however, even though someone flees from one end of the world to [the other], (in vs. 22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. You say something in the synagogue; and look, it comes to pass of its own accord.</p>
<title>6.16 Genesis 27:28ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:22:) <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. All voices are yours, as stated (in Exod. 19:16): <small>AND THERE WERE VOICES (of thunder) AND LIGHTNINGS</small>. And the rains come down only due to you, as stated (in Jer. 10:13): <small>WHEN HE SOUNDS HIS VOICE, THERE IS TUMULT IN THE WATERS OF HEAVEN</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>. The hands of Esau shall be shaken when the voice of Jacob comes. This (coming voice of Jacob) refers to the Messianic King, according to what is stated (in Is. 40:9): <small>GO UP UPON A HIGH MOUNTAIN, O HERALD OF GOOD TIDINGS TO ZION, RAISE YOUR VOICE WITH STRENGTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, &#x003C; BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small> &#x003E;. He said to him: In respect to your brother Esau, if misfortune touches him, he begins reviling and cursing; but in your case, if afflictions touch you, practice self-restraint and do not show anger toward your Creator through your voice. And if you prattle with your voice, <small>THE HANDS OF ESAU</small> will be touching you; [but, if not, <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>?] That which you find at Rephidim. The Israelites prattled &#x003C; there &#x003E; with their voice and said (in Exod. 17:7): <small>IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US &#x003C; OR NOT &#x003E;</small>? Immediately Amalek came against them, as stated (in vs. 8): <small>THEN AMALEK CAME &#x003C; AND FOUGHT WITH ISRAEL AT REPHIDIM &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Isaac said to him (in Gen. 27:24): <small>IS THIS YOU, MY SON ESAU?</small> He said to him: It is I. He said to him (in vs. 25): <small>SERVE ME, AND LET ME EAT&#x2026;. &#x003C; SO HE SERVED HIM, AND HE ATE. HE ALSO BROUGHT HIM WINE, AND HE DRANK &#x003E;</small>. Where did he get wine from? Note, we find that his mother did not give him wine. Rather (in Gen. 27:17): <small>SHE GAVE HIM THE DELICACIES</small>&#x2026;. Then who brought him the wine? Michael brought it to him, wine from the Garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn628">59</xref></sup> Our masters have said: You only find wine resulting in a blessing in case of this &#x003C; wine &#x003E; and Abraham&#x2019;s, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 14:18f.): <small>AND MELCHIZEDEK KING OF SALEM BROUGHT OUT BREAD AND WINE&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND HE BLESSED HIM &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn629">60</xref></sup> And in case of this &#x003C; wine &#x003E; also, when he had drunk it, he blessed him. He said to him (in vs. 26f.): <small>PLEASE COME NEARER AND KISS ME, MY SON; SO HE CAME NEARER AND KISSED HIM</small>&#x2026;. [It should have said: &#x201C;Aha, the odor of his clothes; then he blessed him.&#x201D; Instead he said (in vs. 27): <small>AHA, THE ODOR OF MY SON IS LIKE THE ODOR OF A FIELD</small>.] And he should have said: &#x201C;Aha, the odor of my son&#x2019;s clothes.&#x201D; Instead he said to him (ibid.): <small>AHA, THE ODOR OF MY SON</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; is teaching that the odor of the righteous is a hint of the world to come. What is the meaning of <small>LIKE THE ODOR OF A FIELD</small> &#x2026; ? That &#x003C; his clothes &#x003E; were the garments of the first Adam and bore an odor from the garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn630">61</xref></sup> He immediately said to him (in vs. 28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN</small>. This is Torah, as stated (in Deut. 32:2) <small>LET MY SPEECH DRIP DOWN LIKE THE DEW</small>. (Gen. 27:28, cont.:) <small>AND THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH</small>. These are the Prophets. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ABUNDANCE OF GRAIN</small>. This is Talmud. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND NEW WINE</small>. Here are the Midrashim.<sup><xref rid="fn631">62</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:28): <small>FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN</small>. This is the manna, according to what is stated (in Numb. 11:9): <small>SO WHEN THE DEW CAME DOWN &#x003C; UPON THE CAMP AT NIGHT, THE MANNA WOULD FALL UPON IT &#x003E;</small>. (Gen. 27:28, cont.:) <small>AND THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH</small>. Here is the well.<sup><xref rid="fn632">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:28): <small>FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN</small>. This is Jerusalem, according to what is stated (in Ps. 133:3): <small>LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON &#x003C; WHICH COMES DOWN UPON THE HILLS OF ZION &#x003E;</small>. (Gen. 27:28, cont.:) <small>AND THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH</small>. Here is the fine flour of the oblations. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ABUNDANCE OF GRAIN AND NEW WINE</small>. Here is olive oil.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:28): <small>AND ABUNDANCE OF GRAIN AND NEW WINE</small>. These are high priests. When he had given him these blessings (in vs. 29), he added six &#x003C; more &#x003E; blessings so that there would be ten. These are the following:<sup><xref rid="fn633">64</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li><small>MAY PEOPLES SERVE YOU</small>. These are the children of Noah.</li>
<li><small>AND MAY NATIONS BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>. These are the children of Keturah (Gen. 25:1-4).</li>
<li><small>BE MASTER OVER YOUR BROTHERS</small>. These are the children of Ishmael.</li>
<li><small>AND MAY YOUR MOTHER&#x2019;S CHILDREN BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>. These are the children of Esau.</li>
<li><small>CURSED BE THOSE WHO CURSE YOU</small>. These are Balaam and his colleagues.</li>
<li><small>AND BLESSED BE THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>. These are Moses and his colleagues.</li>
</ol>
<title>6.17 Genesis 27:28ff., Part VII</title>
<p>When Jacob came to bless Judah, he said to him (in Gen. 49:8): <small>AND MAY YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S CHILDREN BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>, because he had a lot of wives. But Isaac, because he only had Rebekah, said to Jacob (in Gen. 27:29): <small>AND MAY YOUR MOTHER&#x2019;S CHILDREN BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn634">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 27:30:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN ISAAC HAD FINISHED BLESSING JACOB, AND &#x003C; JACOB &#x003E; HAD JUST GONE OUT, GONE OUT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn635">66</xref></sup> Two departures are recorded here: <small>GONE OUT, GONE OUT</small>. &#x007B;Isaac said:&#x007D; Isaac&#x2019;s gateway<sup><xref rid="fn636">67</xref></sup> had two ends, a gate to the north and a gate to the south. Jacob left with the plate<sup><xref rid="fn637">68</xref></sup> in his hand. He saw Esau and hid behind the door. One who is in the light does not see &#x007B;him. He forgets him.&#x007D; [one who is in the darkness].<sup><xref rid="fn638">69</xref></sup> Ergo: <small>JUST GONE OUT, GONE OUT</small>. &#x003C; He hid &#x003E; because, if Esau had seen him, he would have killed him. R. Joshua ben Levi said: At the second hour (8:00 <small>A.M.</small>) he learned Esau had gone in to his father, and at the sixth hour (12:00 <small>M</small>.) he was going out. But, while Jacob was detained [for so long] over all this business, where was Esau during this time? R. Joshua ben Levi said: He was catching game and binding it, but an angel was setting it free and driving it away.<sup><xref rid="fn639">70</xref></sup> That is what is stated (in Prov. 12:27): <small>A DECEPTIVE ONE SHALL NOT ROAST HIS GAME, BUT A DILIGENT ONE IS A PERSON OF PRECIOUS WEALTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn640">71</xref></sup> It was not known to Jacob what miracles were performed for him, for, while he was going out, Esau was coming in. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:30): <small>AND &#x003C; JACOB &#x003E; HAD JUST GONE OUT, GONE OUT</small>&#x2026;. Therefore, David has said (in Ps. 86:10): <small>FOR YOU ARE GREAT, AND YOU PERFORM WONDERS (rt.: <italic>PL&#x2019;</italic>), YOU GOD BY YOURSELF</small>. You know what miracles and wonders (rt.: <italic>PL</italic>&#x2019;) you are doing with such a person, but he does not know. This person sleeps upon his bed &#x003C; and &#x003E; arises to put on his clothes. Unless they make a search (rt.: <italic>PL</italic>&#x2019;) for whether there is a snake or a scorpion there, he will cast them off without knowing about them and &#x003C; so &#x003E; be delivered from them. Therefore, David has said to him: &#x003C; It is &#x003E; for you alone to do wonders (rt.: <italic>PL</italic>&#x2019;); &#x003C; it is incumbent &#x003E; upon us to be blessing you, as stated (in Ps. 72:18): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD GOD &#x003C; OF ISRAEL, WHO ALONE DOES WONDERS (rt.: <italic><small>PL</small></italic>&#x2019;) &#x003E;</small>. In Egypt you did miracles for us, and we on our part uttered a song by the sea for you (in Exod. 15:1-18). The Holy One said to them: In this world I have performed wonders (rt.: <italic>PL</italic>&#x2019;) for you and redeemed you from the bondage of Egypt. Thus I am going to redeem you in the world to come from the bondage of Edom (i.e., of Esau) and perform wonders for you. It is so stated (in Micah 7:15): <small>AS IN THE DAYS OF YOUR EXODUS FROM [THE LAND OF EGYPT], I WILL SHOW HIM WONDERS (rt.: <italic>PL&#x2019;</italic></small>).</p>

<p>(Cant. 5:2:) <small>I SLEEP, BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn641">72</xref></sup> The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, <small>I SLEEP</small> without the Holy Temple, <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small> in the synagogues and in the academies. <small>I SLEEP</small> without the sacrifices, <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small> in the commandments and almsgiving. <small>I SLEEP</small> without the good deeds, <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small> for performing them. <small>I SLEEP</small> without the end time, <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small> for the redemption. <small>I SLEEP</small> without the redemption, <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small> for the Holy One when he redeems me. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: &#x007B;How&#x007D; [Where] do we find that the Holy One is called the Heart of Israel? In this scripture (Ps. 73:26): <small>GOD IS THE ROCK OF MY HEART AND MY PORTION FOREVER</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>THE SOUND OF MY BELOVED KNOCKING</small>. This refers to Moses, since it is stated (in Exod. 11:4): <small>THEN MOSES SAID: THUS SAYS THE LORD: ABOUT MIDNIGHT &#x003C; I SHALL GO FORTH INTO THE MIDST OF EGYPT &#x003E;</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>OPEN FOR ME</small>. R. Jose said: The Holy One said: Make an opening for me as with the point of a needle so that I may open up [an opening] for you through which tents and &#x007B;siege fortifications&#x007D; [&#x003C; even &#x003E; a camp]<sup><xref rid="fn642">73</xref></sup> can pass. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>MY SISTER (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>H</italic>)</small>, &#x003C; so named &#x003E; in Egypt, where they became grafted (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>HH</italic>) to me by &#x003C; performing &#x003E; two commandments through the blood of the paschal offering and through the blood of circumcision. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>MY BELOVED (rt.: <italic>R&#x2018;H</italic>):</small> They became beloved (rt.: <italic>R&#x2018;H</italic>) to him at the sea and said (in Exod. 15:18): <small>THE LORD SHALL REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>MY DOVE</small>, &#x003C; so named &#x003E; in Marah where they were given orders for me<sup><xref rid="fn643">74</xref></sup> like a dove through commandments (see Exod. 15:23-25) (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>MY INNOCENT</small>, because they became innocent to me at Sinai and said (in Exod. 24:7): <small>ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL DO AND OBEY</small>. (Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>FOR MY HEAD IS DRENCHED WITH DEW</small>, since it is stated (in Jud. 5:4): <small>EVEN THE HEAVENS DRIPPED</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:2): <small>I SLEEP</small>&#x2026;. Jacob had given up hope that he would receive blessings from Isaac. Yet (ibid., cont.): <small>BUT MY HEART IS AWAKE</small>. (Gen. 27:6, 8-10:) <small>AND REBEKAH SPOKE &#x003C; UNTO JACOB &#x003E;&#x2026;. AND NOW MY SON, HEED ME IN WHAT &#x003C; I CHARGE YOU &#x003E;. PLEASE GO TO THE FLOCK&#x2026;. THEN BRING IT TO YOUR FATHER</small>&#x2026;. He said to her (in vss. 11f.): <small>LOOK, MY BROTHER ESAU IS A HAIRY MAN&#x2026;. PERHAPS MY FATHER WILL FEEL ME</small>&#x2026;. He said to her: Do you not know that anyone who makes fun of his father is &#x003C; as guilty &#x003E; as if he were serving idols? Thus it is stated (in vs. 12, cont.): <small>AND IN HIS EYES I SHALL BE LIKE ONE WHO MOCKS</small>. Now one who mocks is nothing but an idolater, since it is stated (in Jer. 10:15): <small>THEY (i.e., idols) ARE VANITY, A WORK OF MOCKERY</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 27:12, cont.:) <small>THEN I WILL BRING UPON MYSELF A CURSE INSTEAD OF A BLESSING</small>. The Holy One put in her heart (according to Cant. 5:2) <small>THE SOUND OF MY BELOVED KNOCKING</small>. (Ps. 122:8:) <small>FOR THE SAKE OF MY BROTHERS AND COMPANIONS LET ME PLEASE SAY: PEACE BE WITH YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn644">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Cant. 5:2, cont.:) <small>MY INNOCENT</small> (<italic>tammati</italic>), &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; <small>MY TWIN</small> (when vocalized as <italic>tomati</italic>), since she had borne &#x007B;two&#x007D; twins. <small>MY INNOCENT</small> (<italic>tammati</italic>) because &#x003C; the plan &#x003E; was not from Rebekah. Rather the Holy One had put it in her heart. She said to him: When the first Adam sinned, was he cursed? Was not his mother cursed?<sup><xref rid="fn645">76</xref></sup> And now it is my &#x003C; turn &#x003E;. Fulfill your &#x003C; destiny &#x003E; ; and if you should be cursed, your curse will fall upon me. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:13): <small>YOUR CURSE, MY SON, BE UPON ME&#x0021;</small> &#x2026; [Why?] The Holy One said to him: See, I have crowned you with blessings, as stated (in Cant. 5:2, cont.): <small>FOR MY HEAD IS DRENCHED WITH DEW</small>. He went immediately. (According to Gen. 27:14:) <small>THEN HE WENT TO GET THEM AND BROUGHT THEM TO HIS MOTHER</small>&#x2026;. He went in with his father and received the blessings, as stated (in vs. 28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU &#x003C; FROM THE DEW OF HEAVEN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.19 Genesis 27:28ff., Part IX</title>
<p>It is written (in Micah 5:6 [7]): <small>THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES, &#x003C; LIKE DEW &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB</small>&#x2026;. These are the remnant of which the Holy One spoke to Elijah (in I Kings 19:18): <small>YET I WILL LEAVE SEVEN THOUSAND IN ISRAEL, ALL THE KNEES THAT HAVE NOT KNELT TO BAAL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn646">77</xref></sup> These are also the ones who were separated out in the days of Gideon when he said to the Holy One (in Jud. 6:36f.): <small>IF YOU WILL REALLY SAVE ISRAEL BY MY HAND, AS YOU SAID, SEE, I AM PLACING &#x003C; A FLEECE OF WOOL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: I have had it written (in Hos. 14:6 [5]): <small>I WILL BE FOR ISRAEL LIKE THE DEW</small>. But you have said (in Jud. 6:37, cont.): <small>&#x003C; IF THERE IS DEW UPON FLEECE ONLY &#x003E; AND DRYNESS UPON ALL THE GROUND, &#x003C; I WILL KNOW &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Is it possible&#x0021; I do not act so&#x0021; How is it shown? In that &#x201C;and God did so&#x201D; is not written here (in vs. 38) but <small>AND IT WAS SO</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; it happened of its own accord. However, when he said (in vs. 39): <small>LET THERE BE DRYNESS UPON THE FLEECE ONLY</small>, &#x003C; there follows &#x003E; immediately (in vs. 40): <small>AND GOD DID SO ON THAT DAY</small>&#x2026;. Why? Because it is so written (in Hos. 14:6 [5]): <small>I WILL BE FOR ISRAEL LIKE THE DEW</small>. The Holy One said to him (in Jud. 7:4, 6): &#x007B;<small>THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH YOU ARE TOO MANY&#x007D; [THE PEOPLE ARE STILL TOO MANY]. BRING THEM DOWN TO THE WATER, AND I WILL TEST THEM FOR YOU THERE&#x2026;. NOW THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO LAPPED</small>&#x2026;. Those who knelt upon their knees to drink water, willing or not, were bowing down to idols.<sup><xref rid="fn647">78</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in vs. 7): <small>THROUGH THE THREE HUNDRED MEN WHO LAPPED I WILL DELIVER YOU</small>. As for the hundreds (of others) who have not bowed down, these have risen up. Concerning them it says (in I Kings 19:18): <small>YET I WILL LET REMAIN IN ISRAEL SEVEN THOUSAND, ALL THE KNEES THAT HAVE NOT KNELT TO BAAL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. So it is about them that it says (in Micah 5:6 [7]): <small>THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE &#x003C; IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES &#x003E;, LIKE DEW FROM THE LORD;</small> for the dew is a sign<sup><xref rid="fn648">79</xref></sup> of the resurrection of the dead. So also has Isaiah said (in Is. 26:19): <small>LET YOUR DEAD LIVE&#x0021; [LET MY CORPSES ARISE&#x0021;&#x2026; FOR YOUR DEW IS LIKE THE DEW OF LIGHTS]</small>. Rav Ariste said in the name of R. Berekhyah: Isaiah proclaimed before the Holy One: <small>LET YOUR DEAD LIVE</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; those who were dishonored &#x007B;for our sake. One&#x007D; was crucified.<sup><xref rid="fn649">80</xref></sup> Why? Because he had circumcised his son. And one was burned. Why? Because he had observed the Sabbath. And another was killed. Why? Because he had read the Torah. For this reason it sae: <small>LET YOUR DEAD LIVE</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; those who were dishonored &#x007B;for our sake. One&#x007D; was crucified.<sup><xref rid="fn650">81</xref></sup> Why? Because he had circumcised his son. And one was burned. Why? Because he had observed the Sabbath. And another was killed. Why? Because he had read the Torah. For this reason it saRIP DEW &#x003E; &#x003E;. You find that even righteous ones do not control the dew. &#x007B;The Holy One said to him.&#x007D; [Rather it is the Holy One] by himself. You want to know &#x003C; that &#x003E;, when Elijah arose and said (in I Kings 17:1): <small>DURING THESE YEARS THERE SHALL NEITHER BE DEW NOR</small> [<small>RAIN</small>, the Holy one did not hearken]. Instead, the dew was coming down. Where is it shown? Where he says to Elijah (in I Kings 18:1): <small>GO, APPEAR TO AHAB, AND I WILL SEND [RAIN] &#x003C; UPON THE FACE OF THE GROUND &#x003E;</small>. &#x201C;Dew&#x201D; is not written here. Instead &#x003C; he said &#x003E;: <small>AND I WILL SEND RAIN UPON THE FACE OF THE GROUND</small>. From here it follows that the dew had been coming down from the Holy One all the time in order to make known that no one is master of the dew but the Holy One. &#x007B;And the Holy One said&#x007D; [Thus did the Holy One say] to Israel: When you do my will, just as no mortal rules over the dew, so no mortal rules over you. Thus it is stated (in Micah 5:6 [7]): <small>THEN THE REMNANT OF JACOB SHALL BE &#x003C; IN THE MIDST OF MANY PEOPLES, LIKE DEW FROM THE LORD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.20 Genesis 27:28ff., Part X</title>
<p>It is written (in Ps. 121:1): <small>A SONG OF ASCENTS. I WILL LIFT UP MY EYES UNTO THE MOUNTAINS. FROM WHERE WILL MY HELP COME</small>? It is also written (in Zech. 4:7): <small>WHO ARE YOU, O GREAT MOUNTAIN, BEFORE ZERUBBABEL? BECOME LEVEL GROUND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn651">82</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>WHO ARE YOU, O GREAT MOUNTAIN</small>? This is the Messianic King. Then why does it call him <small>GREAT MOUNTAIN</small>? Because he is greater than the ancestors, as stated (in Is. 52:13): <small>BEHOLD, MY SERVANT SHALL BRING LOW</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn652">83</xref></sup> <small>HE SHALL BE EXALTED, LIFTED UP, AND BECOME EXCEEDINGLY TALL. HE SHALL BE EXALTED (rt.: <italic>RWM</italic>)</small> more than Abraham, <small>LIFTED UP</small> more than Moses, <small>AND BECOME EXCEEDINGLY TALL</small>, more so than the ministering angels. <small>&#x003C; HE SHALL BE EXALTED &#x003E;</small> more than Abraham, of whom it is written (in Gen. 14:22): <small>I HAVE RAISED (rt.: <italic>RWM</italic>) MY HAND UNTO THE LORD</small>. &#x003C; He shall be &#x003E; <small>LIFTED UP</small> more than Moses, of whom it is stated (in Numb. 11:12): <small>THAT YOU</small> (the <small>LORD</small>) <small>SHOULD SAY TO ME (Moses): LIFT THEM UP IN YOUR BOSOM AS THE NURSE LIFTS UP A SUCKLING CHILD. AND</small> &#x003C; he shall &#x003E; <small>BECOME&#x2026; TALL (rt.: <italic>GBH</italic>)</small>, more than the ministering angels, of whom it is stated (in Ezek. 1:18): <small>THEIR (the angelic wheels&#x2019;) RIMS (rt.: <italic>GBB</italic>) WERE BOTH TALL (rt.: <italic>GBH</italic>) &#x003C; AND AWESOME &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. From whom did he arise? From [Zerubbabel, and Zerubbabel &#x003C; arose &#x003E;] from David. Thus it is stated (in I Chron 3:10-24): <small>AND SOLOMON&#x2019;S SON WAS REHOBOAM, ABIJAH HIS SON, ASA HIS SON, JEHOSHAPHAT HIS SON, JORAM HIS SON, AHAZIAH HIS SON, JOASH HIS SON, AMAZIAH HIS SON, AZARIAH HIS SON, [JOTHAM HIS SON], AHAZ HIS SON, HEZEKIAH HIS SON, MANASSEH HIS SON, AMON HIS SON, AND JOSIAH HIS SON. NOW THE SONS OF JOSIAH WERE JOHANAN THE FIRST-BORN, JEHOIAKIM THE SECOND, ZEDEKIAH THE THIRD, AND SHALLUM THE FOURTH. THE SONS OF JEHOIAKIM WERE HIS SON JECONIAH AND HIS SON ZEDEKIAH. AND THE SONS OF JECONIAH, THE CAPTIVE, WERE SHEALTIEL HIS SON, MALCHIRAM, PEDAIAH, SHENAZZAR, JEKAMIAH, HOSHAMA, AND NEDABIAH. THE SONS OF PEDAIAH WERE ZERUBBABEL AND SHIMEI. THE SONS OF ZERUBBABEL WERE MESHULLAM AND HANANIAH, AND SHELOMITH WAS THEIR SISTER; ALSO HASHUBAH, OHEL, BERECHIAH, (HASARIAH) [HASADIAH], JUSHABHESED: FIVE (from after the exile). AND THE SONS OF HANANIAH WERE (PELITIA) [PELATIAH] AND JESHAIAH. AND THE SONS OF &#x003C; JESHAIAH &#x003E;: REPHAIAH; THE SONS OF &#x003C; REPHAIAH &#x003E;: ARNAN; THE SONS OF &#x003C; ARNAN &#x003E;: OBADIAH; THE SONS OF &#x003C; OBADIAH &#x003E;: SHECANIAH; THE SONS OF SHECANIAH: SHEMAIAH. THE SONS OF SHEMAIAH WERE HATTUSH, IGAL, [BARIAH], NEARIAH, AND SHAPHAT: SIX. THE SONS OF NEARIAH WERE ELIOENAI, HIZKIAH, AND AZRIKAM: THREE. AND THE SONS OF ELIOENAI WERE HODAVIAH, ELIASHIB, PELAIAH, AKKUB, JOHANAN, DELAIAH, AND ANANI: SEVEN</small>. Now up to here the Scripture has given [you] detail. Who is Anani? This is the Messianic [King], as stated (in Dan. 7:13): <small>AS I WAS LOOKING ON (IN A VISION AT NIGHT) [IN THE NIGHT VISIONS], BEHOLD, ALONG WITH ANANI</small><sup><xref rid="fn653">84</xref></sup> <small>OF &#x003C; HEAVEN, ONE LIKE A HUMAN BEING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of the <small>SEVEN</small> (in I Chron. 3:24)? [What is] that which is written about the Messiah? That which is stated (in Zech. 4:10): <small>FOR WHOEVER HAS DESPISED THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS SHALL REJOICE TO SEE THE PLUMMET IN THE HAND OF ZERUBBABEL, &#x003C; EVEN &#x003E; SEVEN: (BEHOLD), [THESE ARE] THE EYES (&#x2018;<italic>ene</italic>) OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. It is therefore stated (in Zech. 4:7): <small>WHO ARE YOU, O GREAT MOUNTAIN, BEFORE ZERUBBABEL? BECOME LEVEL GROUND</small>. This is what is written about him (in Is. 11:4): <small>SO HE SHALL JUDGE THE POOR WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND DECIDE WITH EQUITY &#x003C; FOR THE MEEK (<italic>&#x2018;anawi</italic>) OF THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Zech. 4:7, cont.:) <small>FOR HE SHALL BRING FORTH THE CORNERSTONE</small>. This is the stone of Jacob, about which it is stated (in Gen. 28:18): <small>THEN JACOB AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, TOOK THE STONE &#x003C; WHICH HE HAD PUT UNDER HIS HEAD, SET IT UP AS A PILLAR &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And so Daniel has stated (in Dan. 2:34): <small>YOU LOOKED ON UNTIL A STONE WAS CUT OUT WITH[OUT] HANDS &#x003C; AND SMOTE THE IMAGE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It is also written (in vs. 35): <small>THEN &#x003C; THE IRON, THE CLAY, THE BRASS, THE SILVER, AND THE GOLD &#x003E; WERE BROKEN IN PIECES (INTO ONE &#x003C; MASS &#x003E;) [TOGETHER]&#x2026; [AND THE STONE WHICH SMOTE THE IMAGE BECAME A GREAT MOUNTAIN]</small>. Now what is <small>[A GREAT] MOUNTAIN</small>? (Zech. 4:7): <small>WHO ARE YOU, O GREAT MOUNTAIN</small>? And from where does it come? By way of the mountains, as stated (in Is. 52:7): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL UPON THE MOUNTAINS ARE THE FEET OF THE ONE BRINGING GOOD TIDINGS</small>. In that hour Israel shall look and say (with Ps. 121:1f.): <small>I WILL LIFT UP EYES MY UNTO THE MOUNTAINS. &#x003C; FROM WHERE WILL MY HELP COME? &#x003E; MY HELP COMES FROM THE LORD</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.21 Genesis 27:33ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:33:) <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED &#x003C; EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART, BUT THE ANSWER OF THE TONGUE COMES FROM THE LORD</small>. What are the considerations of the heart? [If] one [has] an account or any business with his associate, he may think in his heart and say: If we should stand [with him] (in court), he would say thus and so to me; and I would say thus and so to him. &#x003C; When &#x003E; he does stand against me, it turns out that after all the things that he was considering, he does not speak &#x003C; them &#x003E;, but forgets. Ergo: Solomon said it well (in Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART, BUT THE ANSWER OF THE TONGUE COMES FROM THE LORD</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART</small>. R. Levi said: The Holy One created six members for a person, three under his control and three not under his control.<sup><xref rid="fn654">85</xref></sup> Now these are the three which are not under his control: The nose, the eye, and the ear. How so? In the case of someone passing unexpectedly through a market where they were burning incense before an idol, he did not wish to smell it. Even though he does not wish to smell it, what should he do? Thus it is that the nose is not under one&#x2019;s control. Likewise the eye is not under one&#x2019;s control. How so? &#x003C; If &#x003E; one passed through the market and saw a transgression, but did not want &#x003C; to see it &#x003E;, what should he do? Why? Because the eye is not under his control. Likewise the ear is not under one&#x2019;s control. How so? &#x003C; If &#x003E; he was walking along and heard a person reviling and blaspheming, he did not want to hear blasphemies. But nevertheless, he was under an obligation in regard to the rending of garments. Thus R. Simeon has said: One who hears and one who blasphemes are &#x003C; both &#x003E; under an obligation in regard to the rending of garments.<sup><xref rid="fn655">86</xref></sup> Since the blasphemies have multiplied, you have to stop. It is evident that no one can &#x003C; stand &#x003E; listening to blasphemies,<sup><xref rid="fn656">87</xref></sup> but what can one do when his ears are not under his control? Now these are the three which are under his control: The mouth, the hand, and the foot. In the case of the hand, if someone wants to steal, he steals; and if not, he does not steal. Also, if he wants to kill with his hand, he kills; and if not, he does not kill. So much for the hand. In the case of the foot, if someone wants to go on foot to serve an idol, he goes; and if not, he does not go. Also, if he wants to carry out a commandment, he performs it; and if not, he does not perform it. Likewise, in the case of the mouth, if someone wants to speak, [whether good or evil], he speaks; and if not, he does not speak. Ergo (in Prov. 16:1): <small>ONE MAY POSSESS THE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE HEART</small>.</p>
<title>6.22 Genesis 27:33ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY</small>. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina:<sup><xref rid="fn657">88</xref></sup> One does not say: <small>EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY</small> unless there was another &#x003C; event &#x003E; before it (for it to exceed). So what were the two tremblings that Isaac had? One was on Mount Moriah when his father bound him and took up the knife to slaughter him. The Holy One appeared above the angels and opened up the firmament. When Isaac raised his eyes and saw the chambers of the chariot, he trembled and shook. But here he trembled, and his trembling was greater than the first time&#x0021; There he trembled when he saw the Holy One, the chambers of the chariot, and the angels. But here, because Jacob had entered and taken the blessings, his trembling was greater than that &#x003C; former &#x003E; trembling. But why did he tremble? Nathan the Haver said in the name of R. Aha and R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite &#x003C; who said &#x003E; in the name of R. Johanan: When Jacob entered, the Garden of Eden entered with him, as stated (in Gen. 27:27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn658">89</xref></sup> And note that he did not put on anything but clothes of goat&#x2019;s hair, as stated (in vs. 16): <small>THEN SHE CLOTHED HIS ARMS &#x003C; AND THE HAIRLESS PART OF HIS NECK &#x003E; WITH THE SKINS OF GOAT KIDS</small>. And you do not have a worse odor in the &#x003C; whole &#x003E; world than goatskins washed smooth. But what is the meaning (of vs. 27): <small>THEN HE SMELLED THE ODOR OF HIS GARMENTS?</small> Some interpret it to say: The Holy One blew on the clothes of Isaac the odor of the incense which was going to be used in the Temple. When Esau the Wicked entered, however, &#x003C; the result was as &#x003E; R. Aha and R. Johanan have said: Gehinnom entered with him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 18:3): <small>WHEN A WICKED ONE COMES, THERE IS ALSO DESPISING; AND WITH DISGRACE, SHAME</small>. When Esau arrived, Isaac perceived the house becoming hot and &#x003C; so &#x003E; perceived Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn659">90</xref></sup> He began to scream and tremble, as stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED &#x003C; EXCEEDINGLY GREATLY &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>[(Gen. 27:33, cont.:) <small>AND SAID: WHO THEN</small> (<italic>mi &#x2018;efo&#x2019;</italic>)?] What is the meaning of MY &#x2018;EFO&#x2019; (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>P</italic>&#x2019;)? Mi <italic>&#x2018;efoh</italic> (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>PH</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn660">91</xref></sup> Isaac said: Sovereign of the Universe: Who is being baked (<italic>mi ne&#x2019;efah</italic>, rt.: &#x2019;<italic>PH</italic>) in this oven (i.e., of Gehinnom), I or my son Jacob? The Holy One said to him: Neither you nor your son Jacob. But who? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE THAT HAS HUNTED GAME</small>. This is Esau, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>ESAU BECAME A CUNNING HUNTER</small>.</p>
<title>6.23 Genesis 27:33ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 27:33): Why did he tremble? Because he had blessed the younger before the elder; for he had intended to bless both of them. So he called Esau in order to bless him first, since he was the elder. Then afterwards, &#x003C; he would call &#x003E; Jacob. So he intended. Why? Because before the Holy One it is difficult to supplant a genealogical chain, to replace primogeniture. So note that he only called Esau. On what basis do you say that he wished to bless Jacob? On the basis of what Jacob said, &#x007B;and he said&#x007D; [to his mother] (in Gen. 27:12): <small>THEN I WILL BRING UPON MYSELF A CURSE INSTEAD OF A BLESSING</small>. He said to her: Even the blessing which he was going to give me, in the end he will not give me. Isaac only trembled when he said: What sin is on my hands that the genealogical chain should be ruined at my hands, for me to bless the younger &#x003C; first &#x003E; and the elder afterwards? And so you find: In every place Moses comes before Aaron;<sup><xref rid="fn661">92</xref></sup> but when it comes to genealogy, Aaron is before Moses. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF AARON AND MOSES</small>. R. Abba said in the name of R. Johanan of the Bet Guvrin: In the case of Reuben also, when that event (the selling of Joseph) happened at his hands, his father gave his birthright to Joseph. Thus it is stated (in I Chron. 5:1): <small>AND THE SONS OF REUBEN, THE FIRST-BORN OF ISRAEL. NOW HE IS FIRST-BORN; BUT, WHEN HE HAD DEFILED HIS FATHER&#x2019;S BED, HIS BIRTHRIGHT WAS GIVEN TO (JOSEPH) [THE SONS JOSEPH BEN ISRAEL]</small>. Hence the birthright belonged to Joseph. In the genealogy, however, he was not able to keep his birthright away from him, as stated (in Exod. 6:14): <small>THE SONS OF REUBEN THE FIRST-BORN OF ISRAEL</small>. &#x201C;Now he was the first-born&#x201D; is not written here (in I Chron. 5:1), but: <small>NOW HE IS THE FIRST-BORN</small>. So also in the case of the sons of Noah, Japheth was the oldest: but because Shem was more righteous, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; counts him first in every place.<sup><xref rid="fn662">93</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 9:18): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH</small>. In regard to genealogy, however, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentions Japheth as being the eldest. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 10:21): <small>AND UNTO SHEM THERE WERE CHILDREN BORN. HE WAS ALSO FATHER TO ALL THE CHILDREN OF EBER &#x003C; AND &#x003E; THE BROTHER OF JAPHETH, WHO WAS THE OLDEST</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">94</xref></sup> R. Tanhuma said: But you also have to learn &#x003C; through &#x003E; greater insight, that Shem was second to Japheth. Therefore, you find that Noah sired a son at &#x003C; an age of &#x003E; five hundred years. It is written (in Gen. 5:32): <small>AND NOAH WAS FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OLD; &#x003C; AND NOAH BEGOT SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH</small> &#x003E;. Now the flood took place (according to Gen. 7:11): <small>IN THE SIX HUNDREDTH YEAR OF NOAH&#x2019;S LIFE</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;Since&#x007D; it is also written of Shem that he sired a son at &#x003C; the age of &#x003E; a hundred years, &#x007B;he was lacking two&#x007D; [two years after the flood). It is so stated (in Gen. 11:10): <small>THESE ARE THE DESCENDANTS OF SHEM: SHEM WAS A HUNDRED YEARS OLD WHEN HE BEGOT ARPACHSHAD, TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD</small>. If he had been the eldest, it would have been necessary to say only: <small>HE BEGOT ARPACHSHAD, TWO YEARS AFTER THE FLOOD</small>. You also learn from here that Japheth was two years older than Shem according to the reckoning of my calculation. Here also (in Gen. 27:33), Isaac only trembled when he said: What sin is there on my hands that I have blessed the younger before the elder and have changed the order? Jacob went out and Esau came in, as stated (in Gen. 27:30): <small>AND JACOB HAD JUST GONE OUT</small>&#x2026;. He (Esau) said to his father (in vs. 32): <small>I AM [YOUR SON], YOUR FIRST-BORN, ESAU</small>. His father began saying: Who is this one who entered and received the blessings? The Holy Spirit said to him: It was Jacob. He said to him (in vs. 33): <small>AND I HAVE EATEN OF EVERYTHING</small>. R. Isaac said: In that dish Isaac had a taste <small>OF EVERYTHING</small> that the Holy One had created during the six days of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn664">95</xref></sup> Also R. Judah b. R. Shallum said in the name of R. Ayyevu: In that dish Isaac had a taste of whatever is stored up for the righteous in the days to come. [Isaac said to him: In that dish I tasted everything that the Holy One has created]. Esau said to him: Daddy, [tell me:] What is that dish? Isaac said to him: &#x003C; Whatever I ask for &#x003E;. I asked for pheasant;<sup><xref rid="fn665">96</xref></sup> I tasted it. Esau said to him: Daddy, tell me the basic &#x003C; ingredient &#x003E;. He said to him: It was meat. R. Hananyah b. R. Isaac said: When Esau heard this, he began striking his face. He said: Woe to that man, as stated (in Gen. 27:34): <small>AND HE LET OUT A GREAT AND BITTER CRY</small>&#x2026;. Esau said: He fed me pottage of lentils, and I gave him my birthright. Now he has fed Daddy meat. You must know with what blessings he blessed him&#x0021; <small>HE BEGAN TO CRY AND SAY: IS HE NOT RIGHTLY NAMED JACOB (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>QB</italic>)? [FOR HE HAS CHEATED (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>QB</italic>) ME THESE TWO TIMES. HE TOOK MY BIRTHRIGHT; AND, SEE, NOW HE HAS TAKEN MY BLESSING</small>.] His father said to him: So what should I do for you? He said to him: He has already taken my birthright. Isaac said to him: Over this matter I was sorry. He also said: Perhaps I transgressed a commandment of the Law in blessing the younger before the elder. Now that I have already blessed him, (according to Gen. 27:33:) <small>HE SHALL ALSO BE BLESSED</small>.</p>
<title>6.24 Genesis 27:33ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 27:35:) <small>BUT HE SAID: YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT &#x003C; AND TOOK YOUR BLESSING &#x003E;</small>. Was he talking about a righteous one being <small>WITH DECEIT</small>? Heaven forbid&#x0021; Rather &#x003C; the verse means &#x003E;: &#x201C;He came with cunning because of you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn666">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 27:36:) <small>THEN HE SAID: HAVE YOU NOT RESERVED ME</small>]<sup><xref rid="fn667">98</xref></sup> <small>A BLESSING</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn668">99</xref></sup> Resh Laqish said: This is one of three children of Adam who came with a legal circumvention against the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn669">100</xref></sup> Esau said to him: If both of us are righteous, does not your God have &#x003C; enough &#x003E; blessings to bless both of us? The Holy One said to him: May your mouth be stopped up&#x0021; Look, Jacob is blessing twelve tribes, and it is not a case of him blessing one as he blesses another. Even so he was filled with compassion for him. He came to bless him, but the Divine Presence departed from him. He began to pray and say (in the words of Is. 26:10): <small>LET THE WICKED BE SHOWN FAVOR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn670">101</xref></sup> He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>HE WILL NOT LEARN RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. He said to him: Do you desire to bless this one? He is going to destroy my house and confuse lands<sup><xref rid="fn671">102</xref></sup> and riches. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>IN A LAND OF INTEGRITY HE WILL ACT UNJUSTLY</small>. Isaac said to him: Give to him in this world, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE SHALL NOT SEE THE MAJESTY OF THE LORD</small> in the world to come because he would compel<sup><xref rid="fn672">103</xref></sup> me to repay him the glory with which he honored me. Esau immediately raised his eyes upward and wept, as stated (in Gen. 27:38): <small>AND ESAU LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT</small>. The Holy One said: Although he is wicked, flatter him. R. Eleazar said: Esau shed three tears, one from his right &#x003C; eye &#x003E;, one from his left, and one disappeared in the midst of his eye.<sup><xref rid="fn673">104</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Look, the wicked one is weeping over his life&#x0021; How am I to turn him away empty&#x0021; He immediately told his father to bless him. This text is related (to Ps. 80:6 [5]): <small>YOU HAVE FED THEM THE BREAD OF TEARS AND HAVE HAD THEM DRINK A SHALISH</small><sup><xref rid="fn674">105</xref></sup> <small>OF TEARS</small>. R. Abbin said in the name of R. Aha: Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, now if in the case of Esau the Wicked, because he had shed two tears, &#x003C; you were &#x003E; filled with compassion for him immediately; how much the more so in our case, when our tears &#x003C; flow &#x003E; constantly day and night like bread, as stated (in Ps. 42:4 [3]): <small>MY TEARS HAVE BEEN MY BREAD DAY AND NIGHT</small>. Up to now the proper time has not arrived for him to be filled with compassion over you. David has said (in Ps. 39:13 [12]): <small>HEAR MY PRAYER, O LORD, AND GIVE EAR TO MY CRY. DO NOT KEEP SILENCE AT MY TEARS</small>. The Holy One said to them: I will repay Esau the Wicked for the glory of his ancestors, and I will exalt him. Afterwards, I am coming to exalt you and repay &#x007B;them&#x007D; [you] for what you have achieved and for what your ancestors achieved. It is so stated (in Ps. 46:11 [ 10]): <small>I WILL BE EXALTED AMONG THE GENTILES; I WILL BE EXALTED IN THE EARTH</small>. It is simply that the Holy One said to Jacob (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>. It is also written (in Mal. 3:12): <small>FOR YOU WILL BE A DELIGHTFUL LAND</small>. Esau said to him (in Gen. 27:37): <small>BLESS ME ALSO, O MY FATHER</small>. Isaac said to him: With what shall I bless you? R. Berekhyah said: He said to him: I made him a lord over you. In anything whatever that I should bless you, I should be blessing him. Why? Because whatever the slave acquires, he acquires for his master. (Gen. 27:29:) <small>BE A MASTER TO YOUR BROTHER</small> is what Isaac said to Jacob. That was the seventh blessing (in Gen. 27:29). Now Isaac had set down ten blessings with which he had blessed him, but he said to him only (in vs. 27:37): &#x201C;<small>BEHOLD, I HAVE MADE HIM A MASTER OVER YOU</small>.&#x201D; He did, however, say to him: With everything that you are thinking I should bless you, I should only be blessing him. Why? Because whatever the servant has belongs to the master. Thus in Egypt, even though they had been enslaved to them, when they left them they took all their property. So also in the case of thirty-one kings (in Josh. 12:7-24), Israel drove them from their land and took their wealth. So also now in respect to what the peoples of the world are plundering from Israel, Israel belongs to the LORD. Thus it is stated (in Is. 23:18): <small>HER (in reference to Tyre as a harlot) PROFITS AND HER HIRE SHALL BE DEDICATED TO THE LORD &#x007B;OF HOSTS&#x007D;. THEY SHALL NOT BE TREASURED OR STORED, FOR HER PROFITS SHALL BELONG TO THOSE WHO DWELL BEFORE THE LORD FOR EATING THEIR FILL AND FOR SPLENDID CLOTHING</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 7 Genesis, Parashah VII: <italic>Wayyetse</italic></title>
<title>7.1 Genesis 28:10ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 28:10:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 12:15): <small>THE WAY OF A FOOL IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES</small>. This refers to Esau the Wicked, according to what is written above (in Gen. 28:8f): <small>NOW ESAU SAW THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF CANAAN WERE EVIL&#x2026;. SO ESAU SET OUT UNTO ISHMAEL &#x003C; AND TOOK FOR A WIFE MAHALATH THE DAUGHTER OF ISHMAEL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. He heaped trouble upon trouble. (Prov. 12:15, cont.:) <small>BUT A WISE MAN LISTENS TO ADVICE</small>. This refers to Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn675">1</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:42): <small>NOW IT WAS REPORTED TO REBEKAH ABOUT THE WORDS OF HER ELDER SON ESAU</small> (i.e., about his scheming). <small>&#x003C; SO, HAVING SENT AND CALLED FOR YOUNGER SON JACOB, SHE SAID UNTO HIM: LOOK AT YOUR BROTHER ESAU. HE IS TAKING COMFORT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. When was he taking comfort? When he would have killed you (Jacob), as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>HE IS TAKING COMFORT &#x003C; IN SCHEMING &#x003E; AGAINST YOU TO KILL YOU</small>. (Gen. 27:43:) <small>SO NOW, MY SON, HEED MY VOICE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO NOW, MY SON</small>? She said to him: Yesterday you heeded me and received the blessings; now heed me in order to remain alive. He said to her: But is that the proper way? For me to set out without Daddy&#x2019;s knowledge? If he also tells me, I will do so. Immediately (we read in Gen. 28:1f.): <small>SO ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM&#x2026;. ARISE AND GO TO PADDAN-ARAM</small>&#x2026;. As soon as he heard that, he said to him: Give me an <italic>exiterion</italic> &#x007B;i.e., travel instructions&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn676">2</xref></sup> He said to him (in vs. 3): <small>MAY GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU</small>. Immediately (we read in vs. 7): <small>SO JACOB HEEDED HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER AND WENT TO PADDAN-ARAM</small>&#x2026;. (Gen. 28:10:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 12:15, cont.): <small>BUT A WISE MAN LISTENS TO ADVICE</small>.</p>
<title>7.2 Genesis 28:10ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 6:22): <small>WHEN YOU WALK, IT</small> (your father&#x2019;s commandment and your mother&#x2019;s torah) <small>WILL GUIDE YOU</small>. This refers to Jacob, who had been occupied with Torah when he set out from his father&#x2019;s house, and he did not leave it behind. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>IN YOUR LYING DOWN, IT WILL WATCH OVER YOU</small>. When? (In Gen. 28:11:) <small>THEN HE TOOK ONE OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE, [SET IT UNDER HIS HEAD, AND LAY DOWN IN THAT PLACE]</small>. When he lay down, it guarded him. (Prov. 6:22, cont.:) <small>AND WHEN YOU AWAKEN, IT WILL CONVERSE WITH YOU</small>. [(Gen. 28:16:) <small>THEN JACOB AWAKENED FROM HIS SLEEP</small>.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 6:22): <small>WHEN YOU WALK, IT WILL GUIDE YOU</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; when someone labors at Torah during his life.<sup><xref rid="fn677">3</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IN YOUR LYING DOWN, IT WILL WATCH OVER (rt.: <italic>ShMR</italic>) YOU</small>, [because it keeps (rt.: <italic>ShMR</italic>) him] from worm and maggot. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND WHEN YOU AWAKEN, IT WILL CONVERSE WITH YOU</small>. In the future life, when everyone shall stand in judgment, it is one&#x2019;s advocate<sup><xref rid="fn678">4</xref></sup> and pleads his cause.</p>
<title>7.3 Genesis 28:10ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. This text is related (to I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. This refers to Abraham when he pursued the kings. Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:2): <small>WHO HAS AROUSED &#x003C; RIGHTEOUSNESS &#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn679">5</xref></sup> <small>FROM THE EAST</small> &#x2026; ? (I Sam. 2:9, cont.:) <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. These are the sixteen kings whom he killed in the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &#x003C; HIS FORCES &#x003E; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. This refers to Jacob, when he set out to go to Haran; for the Holy One said this to him (in Gen. 28:15): <small>SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. This refers to Esau, of whom it is stated (in Job 20:26): <small>UTTER DARKNESS AWAITS HIS TREASURES; &#x003C; AN UNFANNED FIRE SHALL CONSUME HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Obad. 18:) <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE &#x2026; AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW; &#x003C; THEY SHALL BURN IT AND CONSUME IT &#x003E;</small>. When Esau set out to pursue Jacob, it was for ten hours that the Holy One concealed the day and made it evening. Accordingly, it is stated (in Gen. 28:11): <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A CERTAIN PLACE, &#x003C; HE SPENT THE NIGHT THERE BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET &#x003E;</small>. So Esau remained in the darkness and did not know where he was going. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 2:9): <small>BUT THE WICKED SHALL PERISH IN DARKNESS</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE ONE SHALL NOT PREVAIL BY STRENGTH</small>. The Holy One said to him: Perhaps you think you are mighty&#x0021; And in the world to come he (the Holy One) is also acting for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 97:11): <small>LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. It also says (in Prov. 4:18f.): <small>BUT THE PATH<sup><xref rid="fn680">6</xref></sup> OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS LIKE LUMINOUS SPLENDOR&#x2026;. &#x003C; BUT THE WAY OF THE WICKED IS LIKE DEEP DARKNESS; THEY DO NOT KNOW ON WHAT THEY WILL STUMBLE &#x003E;</small>. And if you have some doubts (about such treatment of the wicked), it has already happened in this world (to the Egyptians), as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>NOR COULD ONE SEE HIS BROTHER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn681">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. When Jacob set out from his father&#x2019;s house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH &#x003C; ONLY &#x003E; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN</small>. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): <small>BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC</small>. &#x003C; There is &#x003E; also this (in Gen. 24:2): <small>SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD</small>. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of <small>THE ONE WHO RULED</small>? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &#x003C; must &#x003E; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) <small>THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER&#x2019;S GOODS IN HIS HAND</small>. This refers to a <italic>diatheke</italic><sup><xref rid="fn682">8</xref></sup> &#x007B;gift certificate&#x007D; which he carried in his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn683">9</xref></sup> (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) <small>BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC</small>. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces<sup><xref rid="fn684">10</xref></sup> to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): <small>THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES</small>. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): <small>ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT</small>. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): <small>&#x003C; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &#x003E; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD</small>. Jacob knew &#x003C; about it &#x003E; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put &#x007B;his staff for him in his hand&#x007D; [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN</small>. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias.<sup><xref rid="fn685">11</xref></sup> Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &#x003C; Since &#x003E; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired<sup><xref rid="fn686">12</xref></sup> against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>].</p>
<title>7.4 Genesis 28:10ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 28:11:) <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) A CERTAIN PLACE</small>. There is no &#x201C;coming across&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) except for prayer. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 7:16): <small>AS FOR YOU, DO NOT PRAY FOR THIS PEOPLE&#x2026;. AND DO NOT INTERCEDE (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) WITH ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn687">13</xref></sup> It was concerning him that David said (in Ps. 121:4-8): <small>SEE, &#x003C; THE GUARDIAN OF ISRAEL &#x003E; NEITHER SLUMBERS NOR SLEEPS. THE LORD IS YOUR GUARDIAN; THE LORD IS YOUR SHADE&#x2026;. BY DAY THE SUN SHALL NOT SMITE YOU&#x2026;. THE LORD SHALL KEEP YOU FROM ALL EVIL&#x2026;. THE LORD SHALL GUARD YOUR GOING AND YOUR COMING FROM NOW ON AND FOREVER</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:11): <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) A CERTAIN PLACE</small> where the Holy Spirit rested upon him, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; upon Jacob. Then he prophesied that Israel was going to sin and that the Holy Spirit would depart from them. &#x007B;Now this derives from (ibid., cont.): <small>BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET</small>. So also we find that it is written in the prophecy of Micah (3:6): <small>THE SUN SHALL SET &#x003C; UPON THE PROPHETS &#x003E;</small>, where it is a case of retribution and the passing away of prophecy.&#x007D; Thus it is stated (in Jer. 27:18): <small>IF THEY ARE PROPHETS AND IF THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH THEM, PLEASE LET THEM INTERCEDE (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) WITH THE LORD</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; teaches that this &#x201C;coming across&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) is prophecy. (Gen. 28:11:) <small>WHEN HE CAME ACROSS (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;) A CERTAIN PLACE &#x2026; BECAUSE THE SUN HAD SET</small>. What is it that is written (in Micah 3:6)? <small>THE SUN SHALL SET UPON THE PROPHETS, AND THE DAY SHALL BE DARKENED</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 28:11, cont.:) <small>THEN HE TOOK SOME</small><sup><xref rid="fn688">14</xref></sup> <small>OF THE STONES OF THE PLACE, &#x003C; SET THEM UNDER HIS HEAD, AND LAY DOWN IN THAT PLACE &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn689">15</xref></sup> He thought in his heart: My grandfather Abraham sired a righteous &#x003C; son &#x003E; and a wicked &#x003C; son &#x003E; from two women. Isaac was righteous, and Ishmael was wicked. Then Daddy Isaac sired a righteous &#x003C; son &#x003E; and a wicked &#x003C; son &#x003E; from one woman. As for me, since I am to take four wives, how many wicked &#x003C; sons &#x003E; will there be from me? The Holy One said to him: Heaven forbid&#x0021; (According to Cant. 4:7) <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED; THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>. When he arose in the morning, he found that all of the stones were one stone. He was glad that his bed was whole, as stated (in Gen. 28:18): <small>THEN JACOB AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, &#x003C;TOOK THE STONE WHICH HE HAD PUT UNDER HIS HEAD, SET IT UP AS A PILLAR &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as all these stones have become one, so shall all of your sons be righteous. Thus it is stated (in Job 5:23): <small>FOR YOU SHALL HAVE A COVENANT WITH THE STONES OF THE FIELD, AND THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD SHALL BE AT PEACE WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>7.5 Genesis 28:10ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT</small>. It is written (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS AND SHUT [YOUR DOORS] BEHIND ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn690">16</xref></sup> <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>. When you see a fateful hour, do not stand against it but give way to it. Thus it is stated: <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>. Look at me, as it were, for I have perceived an hour &#x003C; made &#x003E; fateful through your sins. I did nothing. Instead I gave way to it, as stated (in Lam. 2:3): <small>HE HAS WITHDRAWN HIS RIGHT HAND</small>&#x2026;. So also you, <small>GO MY PEOPLE</small>. Thus, the one who stands against the hour will fall into its hand; but whoever gives way to the hour will have the hour fall into his hand. Naboth stood against the hour &#x007B;and stood against it&#x007D; [and fell into its hand]. When Ahab said to him (in I Kings 21:2): <small>GIVE ME YOUR VINEYARD SO THAT I MAY HAVE IT FOR A VEGETABLE GARDEN</small>. What did he do? He said (in vs. 3): <small>THE LORD FORBID &#x003C; THAT I SHOULD GIVE YOU MY ANCESTORS&#x2019; INHERITANCE &#x003E;</small>. What happened to him? He fell into the hand of the hour, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>AND THE MEN OF BELIAL TESTIFIED AGAINST [NABOTH BEFORE THE PEOPLE&#x2026;. AND THEY STONED HIM TO DEATH WITH STONES]</small>. Abraham gave way to the hour and fled from Nimrod, the king of the Chaldeans. So the hour returned and fell into his hand when he killed sixteen kings. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>THEN HE DEPLOYED &#x003C; HIS FORCES &#x003E; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT</small>. Isaac also gave way to the hour when the Philistines said to him (in Gen. 26:16): <small>GO AWAY FROM US</small>. Immediately &#x003C; the passage continues &#x003E; (in vs. 17): <small>SO ISAAC WENT AWAY FROM THERE</small>. Then the hour returned and fell into his hand, as stated (in Gen. 26:26-28): <small>THEN ABIMELECH CAME UNTO HIM FROM GERAR&#x2026;. SO ISAAC SAID UNTO THEM: WHY HAVE YOU COME UNTO ME &#x2026;? AND THEY SAID: WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE LORD IS WITH YOU</small>&#x2026;. Joseph also gave way to the hour. When his brothers sold him, was he not able to say: I am your brother? But he gave way to the hour, and the hour returned and fell before him, as stated (in Gen. 50:18): <small>THEN HIS BROTHERS ALSO WENT AND FELL DOWN BEFORE HIM</small>. Moses gave way to the hour, as stated (in Exod. 2:15): <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH</small>. So the hour returned and fell into his hand, as stated (in Exod. 11:3): <small>&#x007B;AND&#x007D; [ALSO] THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY GREAT IN THE EYES OF PHARAOH&#x2019;S [SERVANTS] AND IN THE EYES OF HIS PEOPLE</small>. David also gave way to the hour, as stated (in I Sam. 20:1): <small>BUT DAVID FLED FROM NAIOTH</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 3:1): <small>WHEN HE FLED FROM HIS SON ABSALOM</small>. And it is written (in Ps. 57:1): <small>[WHEN HE FLED] FROM SAUL IN THE CAVE</small>. So the hour returned and fell into his hand when Saul said to him (in I Sam. 24:21 [20]): <small>[PLEASE] LOOK, I KNOW THAT YOU SHALL SURELY REIGN AND IN YOUR HAND THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL SHALL ARISE</small>. So &#x003C; it was &#x003E; also &#x003C; with &#x003E; Jacob, who fled from the hour. (Hosea 12:13 [12]:) <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>. And the hour fell into his hand, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB</small>. Ergo (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER INTO YOUR CHAMBERS</small>. Look into the chambers of your heart, and see that it was not in proportion to your sins that I brought sufferings upon you, for <small>YOUR CHAMBERS</small> are nothing but kidney chambers.<sup><xref rid="fn691">17</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>SEARCHING ALL THE CHAMBERS OF THE BELLY</small>. But, if sufferings come upon you, do not open your mouth and complain against the measure of justice. Rather (according to Is. 26:20, cont.): <small>AND SHUT YOUR DOORS BEHIND YOU</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>. No sufferings ever come except they pass. Thus it is stated: <small>HIDE JUST FOR A MOMENT UNTIL MY ANGER PASSES</small>.</p>
<title>7.6 Genesis 28:10ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 28:12:) <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: What is the difference between the death of the righteous and the death of the wicked? R. Justa bar Shunem said in the name of R. Joshua of Sikhnin: The death of the wicked is neither on the earth nor in the heavens. For it is so written of Ahithophel (in II Sam. 17:23): <small>THEN HE &#x007B;GAVE INSTRUCTIONS UNTO HIS CHILDREN&#x007D; [SET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER] AND HANGED HIMSELF</small>. And likewise in the case of Haman, &#x003C; his death was &#x003E; neither on the earth nor in the heavens. It is so stated (in Esth. 7:10): <small>THEN THEY HANGED HAMAN</small>; and his children as well (according to Esth. 9:25): <small>SO THAT HE AND HIS CHILDREN WOULD BE HANGED</small>. But the death of the righteous is &#x003C; both &#x003E; in the heavens and on the earth, as stated (in I Sam. 25:29): <small>YET THE LIFE OF MY LORD (David) SHALL BE FOUND IN THE BUNDLE OF THE LIVING &#x003C; WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD &#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown &#x003C; that the death of the righteous &#x003E; is on the earth? (II Chron. 32:33:) <small>SO THEY TOOK HIM (Hezekiah) UP AND BURIED HIM IN THE ASCENT OF THE TOMBS OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID. THUS &#x003C; ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM &#x003E; PAID HIM HONOR AT HIS DEATH</small>.</p>
<p>Let our master instruct us further: What is the difference between the dreams of the righteous and the dreams of the wicked? The dreams of the wicked are neither in the heavens nor on the earth. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 41:1): <small>PHARAOH DREAMED, AND THERE HE WAS STANDING ON THE NILE</small>. So also it is written of Nebuchadnezzar (in Dan. 4:2): <small>&#x007B;IT WAS&#x007D; [I SAW] A DREAM, AND IT MADE ME AFRAID</small>, for he was neither on the earth nor in the heavens (cf. vss. 7-8). However, the dreams of the righteous are &#x003C; both &#x003E; in the heavens and on the earth. You therefore find that Joseph said to his brothers (in Gen. 37:7): <small>HERE WE WERE BINDING SHEAVES</small>: Ergo, &#x003C; his dreams were &#x003E; on the earth. Where is it shown that they were also in heaven? Where it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>. So also it was in the case of our father Jacob (according to Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER [PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. Ergo, &#x003C; his dream was both &#x003E; in the heavens and on the earth].</p>
<title>7.7 Genesis 28:10ff., Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER (rt. <italic>SLM</italic>)</small>. R. Jose the Galilean said: He showed him Manasseh making an image (rt. <italic>SML</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn692">18</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon ben &#x007B;Jose&#x007D; [Johay] said: He showed him an altar, as stated (in Exod. 20:21 [24], 23 [26]): <small>AN ALTAR OF EARTH YOU SHALL MAKE FOR ME&#x2026;. AND YOU SHALL NOT GO UP BY STEPS UPON MY ALTAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn693">19</xref></sup> (Gen. 28:12, cont.:) <small>WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. This is the cloud of incense. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD</small>. These are the priests who stand on the ramp (<italic>KBSh</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn694">20</xref></sup> of the altar and minister. R. Simeon ben Halafta said: He showed him Korah, as stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small>. (Gen. 28:12:) <small>WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. He showed him Moses, as stated (in Exod 24:1): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO MOSES: GO UP UNTO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER PLACED ON EARTH</small>. R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: He showed him Jonah, as stated (in Jonah 2:7 [6]): <small>I WENT DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS</small>&#x2026;. (Gen. 28:12, cont.:) <small>WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. He showed him Elijah, as stated (in II Kings 2:11): <small>AND ELIJAH WENT UP IN A WHIRLWIND INTO THE HEAVENS</small>. Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>THEN HE DREAMED</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: He showed him Sinai (<italic>SYNY</italic>). This is a symbol. <italic>S</italic> &#x003D; sixty, <italic>Y</italic> &#x003D; ten, <italic>N</italic> &#x003D; fifty, <italic>Y</italic> &#x003D; ten. The sum is one hundred and thirty. <small>LADDER</small> also is a hundred and thirty.<sup><xref rid="fn695">21</xref></sup> It is stated here (in Gen. 21:12, cont.): <small>PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS</small>. It is also said of Sinai (in Deut. 4:11): <small>&#x007B;AND BEHOLD, IT WAS&#x007D; [AND THE MOUNTAIN WAS] BURNING WITH FIRE UP TO THE HEART OF THE HEAVENS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:12): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD</small>. This refers to Moses and Aaron, as stated (in Exod. 24:9): <small>THEN THERE WENT UP MOSES AND AARON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn696">22</xref></sup> (Gen. 28:13:) <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD UPON IT</small>. (Exod. 19:20:) <small>AND THE LORD CAME DOWN UPON MOUNT SINAI</small>. (Gen. 12:13, cont.:) <small>AND SAID: I AM THE LORD, THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER ABRAHAM AND THE GOD OF ISAAC</small>. It is also stated on Sinai (in Exod. 20:1): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.</p>
<title>7.8 Genesis 28:10ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): <small>BUT JACOB SET OUT</small>. This is one of four children of Adam for whom the land (i.e., spatial distance) was contracted. They are the following: Abraham, Eleazer, Jacob, and Abishai.<sup><xref rid="fn697">23</xref></sup> In the case of Abraham, where is it shown? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; when he went forth to pursue the kings &#x003C; that &#x003E; the land contracted before him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:15): <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">24</xref></sup> And in the case of Eleazer, where is it shown? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; when he went to bring a wife for Isaac &#x003C; that &#x003E; the land contracted before him.<sup><xref rid="fn699">25</xref></sup> What is written about him (in Gen. 24:42)? <small>AND I CAME TODAY (i.e., in one day) TO THE SPRING</small>. The day he set out was the very day on which he arrived. And in the case of Abishai, where is it shown? When he fought with Ishbi-benob the brother of Goliath.<sup><xref rid="fn700">26</xref></sup> What did he do? He went after David with his shield at the ready. In that hour the Holy One put the fear of David upon him, since he said: How swift this man is&#x0021; Where are David and his mighty men? And where is it shown? Where it is so written (in II Sam. 21:15): <small>AND DAVID WAS WEARY</small>. At that time David had said: Oh, that someone would put one of my sister&#x2019;s sons here for me. Now Joab and Abishai were far away from him where they were fighting with the children of Ammon and with Aram (cf. I Chron. 19:10f.) However, when David prayed, the Holy One contracted the land before Abishai, as stated (in II Sam. 21:17): <small>BUT ABISHAI BEN ZERUIAH CAME TO HIS AID</small>. And our father Jacob was also one before whom the Holy One caused the land to contract.<sup><xref rid="fn701">27</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:10; 29:1): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA AND WENT TO HARAN&#x2026;. [THEN JACOB CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY (literally: RAISED HIS FEET)]</small>. Our masters have said: In the case of all the children of Adam, their feet carry them; but in Jacob&#x2019;s case, he keeps his feet up. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 29:1): <small>THEN JACOB RAISED HIS FEET</small>.</p>
<title>7.9 Genesis 28:10ff., Part IX</title>
<p>(Hosea 12:13 [12]:) <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>. From where did he flee? From Beersheba, as stated (in Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>. Was he in Beersheba? Was he not rather in Hebron, as stated (in Gen. 35:27): <small>I.E., HEBRON, WHERE ABRAHAM AND ISAAC SOJOURNED?</small> &#x003C; The situation was merely that he fled &#x003E; from a place set aside for oaths (<italic>shevu&#x2018;ot</italic>), since &#x003C; it was &#x003E; there &#x003C; that &#x003E; Abraham had sworn to Abimelech. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:23, 31): <small>SO NOW SWEAR TO ME BY GOD, BEHOLD&#x2026;. THEREFORE THAT PLACE WAS NAMED BEERSHEBA, (i.e., The Well of the Oath) BECAUSE &#x003C; IT WAS &#x003E; THERE &#x003C; THAT &#x003E; BOTH OF THEM HAD SWORN</small>. Now where is it shown that Isaac had sworn? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:32f.): <small>THAT ISAAC&#x2019;S SERVANTS CAME &#x003C; AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE WELL &#x003E;&#x2026;. SO HE CALLED IT SHIBAH (i.e., oath); &#x003C; THEREFORE THE NAME OF THE CITY IS BEERSHEBA UNTO THIS DAY &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn702">28</xref></sup> And Esau also swore to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:33): <small>&#x003C; THEN JACOB SAID &#x003E; SWEAR TO ME FIRST</small>. &#x003C; Thus he swore an oath &#x003E; when he took his birthright. He thought in his heart and said: If he should come and say: Come, swear to me that you have not taken my blessing by deceit, what shall I be able to do to him? I shall simply go away from this place set aside for oaths. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 28:10): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small> (i.e., The Well of the Oath).<sup><xref rid="fn703">29</xref></sup> Ergo (in Hosea 12:13 [12]): <small>THEN JACOB FLED TO THE LAND OF ARAM</small>.</p>
<p>Resh Laqish said: The Holy One performed miracles with him at the time that he saw the dream. What is written (in Gen. 28:13)? <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn704">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 28:17:) <small>SO HE WAS AFRAID AND SAID: HOW AWESOME IS THIS PLACE&#x0021; THIS</small> is nothing but the Holy Temple, as stated (in Ps. 78:54): <small>THEN HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE BORDER OF HIS SANCTUARY, THIS MOUNTAIN THAT HIS RIGHT HAND HAD PROCURED</small>. Moreover, <small>AWESOME</small> can only refer to the Holy Temple. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 68:36 [35]): <small>O GOD, YOU ARE AWESOME IN YOUR SANCTUARIES</small>. He (Jacob) saw it destroyed, as stated (in Gen. 28:17): <small>THIS IS NOTHING. (Ibid., cont.:) BUT THE HOUSE OF GOD</small>, since he saw it &#x003C; re &#x003E;built. All the prophets also saw it built, destroyed, and &#x003C; re &#x003E; built. The Holy One simply said: You have seen it destroyed in this world, but in the world to come I am &#x003C; re &#x003E; building it myself. Then in my glory I am returning within it with you watching. Thus it is stated (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF THE LORD TO ZION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn705">31</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.10 Genesis 29:31ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 29:31:) <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. &#x007B;It is not said &#x003C; in the text &#x003E; &#x201C;All who stand upright,&#x201D; but <small>ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. And does he also raise up the wicked?&#x007D; R. Hiyya said: The behavior of the Holy One is not like the behavior of one who is flesh-and-blood. According to flesh-and-blood behavior, &#x003C; if &#x003E; one has a wealthy friend, he clings to him and pines for him; but, as soon as his power (literally: hand) declines and he becomes poor, he laughs at him. With the Holy One, however, things are not like that. As soon as he sees someone whose power is down, he gives him a hand and raises him up. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL</small>. It is not said &#x003C; in the text &#x003E; &#x201C;All who stand,&#x201D; but <small>ALL WHO FALL</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>. Would you say that he also raises up the wicked, if they come to a fall? No, for it is stated (in Ps. 36:13 [12]): <small>THERE THE EVILDOERS HAVE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN AND CANNOT RISE</small>. They have fallen; there is no standing for them. Why? Because it is stated (in Ps. 35:5): <small>&#x003C; THEY SHALL BE &#x003E; LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD OVERTHROWING THEM</small>. But those who are righteous (according to Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS</small>. As soon as the Holy One saw that Leah was hated, he said: How am I to make her dear to her husband? Just look, I am raising her up and giving her children first so that she will become loved by her husband. Therefore (according to Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. Now it also says (in I Chron. 2:18): <small>AND CALEB BEN HEZRON HAD CHILDREN BY AZUBAH, A WIFE, AND BY JERIOTH; AND THESE WERE HER SONS: JESHER, SHOBAB, AND ARDON</small>. R. Berekhyah said: She was his wife.<sup><xref rid="fn706">32</xref></sup> Then why was she called Azubah? Because she was abandoned (<italic>azubah</italic>) and ugly. The Holy One said: Look, I am giving her children so that she will become beautiful through them. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THESE WERE HER SONS: JESHER, SHOBAB, AND ARDON</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 145:14): <small>THE LORD UPHOLDS ALL WHO FALL AND RAISES UP ALL WHO ARE BOWED DOWN</small>.</p>
<title>7.11 Genesis 29:31ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. &#x003C; She was hated &#x003E;, not because she was abhorrent to her husband, but because she had scolded him when Jacob had worked seven years for Rachel. Now his mother had said to him (in Gen. 27:44): <small>AND YOU ARE TO STAY WITH HIM (Laban) FOR A WHILE</small>, and he had stayed seven years. (Gen. 29:21, 23:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID UNTO LABAN: GIVE ME MY WIFE&#x2026;. AND, WHEN IT WAS EVENING, HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER LEAH &#x003C; AND BROUGHT HER TO HIM &#x003E;. ALL NIGHT SHE PRETENDED TO BE RACHEL</small>. When he arose in the morning (according to Gen. 29:25), <small>THERE WAS LEAH</small>. He said to her: Daughter of a swindler, why did you trick me? She said to him: &#x003C; What about &#x003E; you&#x0021; Why did you trick your father? When he said to you: Is this my son Esau, you said to him (in Gen. 27:19): <small>I AM ESAU YOUR FIRST-BORN</small>. Now you are saying: Why have you tricked me? And did your father not say &#x003C; to Esau &#x003E; (in Gen. 27:35): <small>YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT?</small> So because of these things with which she scolded him, he began to hate her. The Holy One said: There is no cure for this but sons. Then her husband will desire her. Thus (in Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED, HE OPENED HER WOMB</small>. David also gives praise (in Ps. 146:7): <small>THE ONE WHO EXECUTES JUSTICE FOR THE OPPRESSED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn707">33</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.12 Genesis 29:31ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation: Why was Leah hated? Not because she was more ugly than Rachel. In fact she was as beautiful as Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:16). <small>LABAN HAD TWO (<italic>ShTY</italic>) DAUGHTERS</small>. They were equal (<italic>ShWWT</italic>) in beauty, in loveliness, and in stature. Why does &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; say (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH&#x2019;S EYES WERE WEAK</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn708">34</xref></sup> Simply &#x003C; this &#x003E; : When Rebekah bore Esau and Isaac, there were born to Laban two daughters, Leah and Rachel. They sent letters to each other and agreed among themselves that Esau would take Leah; and Jacob, Rachel. Now Leah would ask about the conduct of Esau and would hear that his conduct was bad. So she would cry all the time &#x003C; and &#x003E; say: Thus my lot has fallen to this wicked man. And for this reason her eyes became weak, as stated (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH&#x2019;S EYES WERE WEAK</small>.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT RACHEL HAD A LOVELY FORM AND WAS LOVELY TO LOOK AT</small>. Why? Because it is stated (in Prov. 15:30): <small>GOOD NEWS PUTS FAT ON THE BONES</small>. He (Esau) took no action. Rather (in Gen. 28:9): <small>ESAU WENT TO ISHMAEL AND TOOK MAHALATH BAT ISHMAEL &#x003C; BEN ABRAHAM, THE SISTER OF NEBAIOTH, FOR A WIFE &#x003E;</small>. Jacob said: Because of the blessings he wanted to kill me; so when I take his wife Leah, who knows if he will leave Mahalath bat Ishmael, come against me, and say: Was it not enough for you to take my birthright and my blessing, that you have taken my betrothed as well&#x0021; He therefore said to Laban (in Gen. 29:18): <small>I SHALL SERVE YOU SEVEN YEARS FOR &#x003C; YOUR YOUNGER DAUGHTER &#x003E; RACHEL</small>. Apart from such a situation, would a man taking a wife leave the older and take the younger?<sup><xref rid="fn709">35</xref></sup> Rather &#x003C; the story is &#x003E; to teach you that, since Leah was sitting around because of Esau, Jacob said to Laban (ibid.): <small>I SHALL SERVE YOU SEVEN YEARS FOR &#x003C; YOUR YOUNGER DAUGHTER &#x003E; RACHEL</small>. Now, when Laban saw that, he said: See here, I am giving away the elder immediately. (Gen. 29:23:) <small>AND, WHEN IT WAS EVENING, HE TOOK HIS DAUGHTER LEAH &#x003C; AND BROUGHT HER TO HIM &#x003E;</small>. Jacob said to him: Now were these the terms?<sup><xref rid="fn710">36</xref></sup> (Gen. 29:25, 26, 28:) <small>DID I NOT SERVE WITH YOU FOR RACHEL? THEN LABAN SAID: IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM IN OUR PLACE&#x2026;. SO JACOB DID THUS, &#x003C; AND COMPLETED THE BRIDAL WEEK OF THIS DAUGHTER; THEN LABAN GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER RACHEL FOR A WIFE &#x003E;</small>. He began to love her more than Leah. The Holy One said: Look, I am giving Leah children so that she may be more beloved than Rachel. (Gen. 29:31:) <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED, HE OPENED HER WOMB</small>.</p>
<title>7.13 Genesis 29:31ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>.] This text is related (to Deut. 21:15-17): <small>WHEN A MAN HAS TWO WIVES, &#x003C; THE ONE BELOVED AND THE OTHER HATED, AND WHEN BOTH THE BELOVED AND THE HATED HAVE BORNE HIM SONS WITH THE FIRST-BORN BELONGING TO THE HATED WOMAN; THEN, ON THE DAY THAT HE WILLS HIS PROPERTY TO HIS SONS AS AN INHERITANCE, HE MAY NOT TREAT THE SON OF THE BELOVED AS THE FIRST-BORN IN PREFERENCE TO THE SON OF THE HATED WHEN HE IS THE FIRST-BORN. INSTEAD, HE SHALL RECOGNIZE THE FIRST-BORN SON OF THE HATED WOMAN BY GIVING HIM A DOUBLE PORTION SINCE HE IS THE FIRST FRUIT OF HIS STRENGTH &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; (Deut. 21:15:) <small>WHEN A MAN HAS</small> &#x003E;: This is Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN</small>. (Deut. 21:15, cont.:) <small>TWO WIVES</small>: Leah and Rachel. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE ONE BELOVED</small>, i.e., Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:30): <small>AND HE ALSO LOVED RACHEL</small>. (Deut. 21:15, cont.:) <small>AND THE OTHER HATED</small>: i.e., Leah, as stated (in Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. (Deut. 21:15, cont.:) <small>AND WHEN BOTH THE BELOVED AND THE HATED HAVE BORNE HIM SONS</small>, i.e., both of them bore for him.<sup><xref rid="fn711">37</xref></sup> Moreover, what Leah produced Rachel produced.<sup><xref rid="fn712">38</xref></sup> Leah produced kings, and so did Rachel [produce kings. Leah produced prophets, and so did Rachel produce prophets]. Leah produced judges, and so did Rachel. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 21:15): <small>AND WHEN &#x003C; BOTH THE BELOVED AND THE HATED &#x003E; HAVE BORNE HIM SONS</small>. (Deut. 21:16:) <small>THEN, ON THE DAY THAT HE WILLS &#x003C; HIS PROPERTY &#x003E; TO HIS SONS AS AN INHERITANCE</small>. When the time had come for him to depart from the world, (according to Gen. 49:1): <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>. (Deut. 21:16, cont.:) <small>HE MAY NOT TREAT THE SON OF THE BELOVED</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; Joseph, <small>AS THE FIRST-BORN</small>. Why? (Vs. 17:) <small>INSTEAD, HE SHALL RECOGNIZE THE FIRST-BORN SON OF THE HATED WOMAN &#x003C; BY GIVING HIM A DOUBLE PORTION &#x003E;</small>. This was Reuben, as stated (in Gen. 49:3): <small>REUBEN, YOU ARE MY FIRST-BORN, &#x003C; MY MIGHT AND THE FIRST FRUIT OF MY STRENGTH, EXCELLING IN ELEVATION AND EXCELLING IN POWER &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; Jacob gave this blessing &#x003E;, even though he said to his shame (in vs. 4): <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER, YOU SHALL NO LONGER EXCEL; &#x003C; FOR YOU WENT UP TO YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S BED, THEN DEFILED IT &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.) <small>HE WENT UP TO MY COUCH</small>. When Moses would come, about whom it is written (in Exod. 19:3): <small>THEN MOSES WENT UP TO GOD</small>, he would redeem him. As Moses stood &#x003C; there &#x003E;, he sought mercy for him. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:6): <small>LET REUBEN LIVE</small>. The Holy One said (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LET HIM NOT DIE</small>. It turns out that he gets &#x007B;compensation in proportion to both of them&#x007D; [a pardon<sup><xref rid="fn713">39</xref></sup> from the mouth of both of them] (i.e., God and Moses). Thus it is stated (in Deut. 21:17): <small>INSTEAD, HE SHALL RECOGNIZE THE FIRST-BORN [SON OF THE HATED WOMAN] BY GIVING HIM A DOUBLE PORTION</small>. (Deut. 33:6:) <small>LET REUBEN LIVE, AND LET HIM NOT DIE; &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; LET REUBEN LIVE</small> in this world, <small>AND LET HIM NOT DIE</small> in the world to come. Why? (Deut. 21:17:) <small>SINCE HE IS THE FIRST FRUIT OF HIS STRENGTH</small>. [It is also written (in Gen. 49:3): <small>MY MIGHT AND THE FIRST FRUIT OF MY STRENGTH</small>.]</p>
<title>7.14 Genesis 29:31ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 29:31): <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT LEAH WAS HATED</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 12:8): <small>MY HERITAGE HAS BECOME FOR ME LIKE A LION IN THE FOREST &#x2026; [THEREFORE I HAVE HATED IT (literally: HER)]</small>. How so? The Holy One saw that wicked children were going to issue from her; so he called her <small>HATED</small>. Now the wicked ones are these: Jehoram, Jehoash, Ahaz, Manasseh, Amon, Jehoiakim, &#x003C; and &#x003E; Zedekiah. About Jehoram, it is written (in II Kings 8:18): <small>AND HE WALKED IN THE WAY OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AS THE HOUSE OF AHAB HAD DONE</small>. About Ahaz, it is written (in II Kings 16:2): <small>AND HE DID NOT DO WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD [HIS GOD] AS HIS ANCESTOR DAVID &#x003C; HAD DONE &#x003E;</small>. Isaiah had said to him (according to Is. 7:11): <small>ASK A SIGN FROM THE LORD YOUR GOD. MAKE IT AS DEEP AS SHEOL</small>, for the dead to live again or for Korah to rise from Sheol. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR AS HIGH AS ABOVE</small>. You may ask for Elijah to descend from the heavens. He said to him: I know that he has power to do &#x003C; such things &#x003E;, but I do not want the name of names to be sanctified at my hands. Thus it is stated (in vs. 12): <small>I WILL NOT ASK, NOR PUT THE LORD TO THE TEST</small>. About Jehoash, it is written (in II Kings 12:3 [3]): <small>AND JEHOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS AS THE PRIEST JEHOIADA INSTRUCTED HIM</small>. But when Jehoiada died, evil occurred, as stated (in II Chron. 24:17): <small>NOW &#x007B;IT CAME TO PASS&#x007D; AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA, &#x003C; THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING. THEN THE KING HEARKENED UNTO THEM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. See what is written about Manasseh (in II Chron. 33:6-7): <small>&#x003C; HE DID MUCH EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD TO ANGER HIM &#x003E;, AND HE SET UP A SCULPTURED IMAGE, WHICH HE HAD MADE, IN THE HOUSE OF GOD</small>. About Amon, it is written (in II Chron. 33:22-23): <small>AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD&#x2026;. AND TO ALL THE IMAGES WHICH HIS FATHER MANASSEH HAD MADE &#x003C; AMON SACRIFICED &#x003E;&#x2026;. [MOREOVER, HE DID NOT HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE THE LORD&#x2026;. FOR AMON INCURRED A LOT OF GUILT]</small>. About Jehoiakim, it is written (in II Chron. 36:8): <small>NOW AS FOR THE REST OF THE ACTS OF JEHOIAKIM, [THE ABOMINATIONS WHICH HE DID], AND WHAT WAS FOUND AGAINST HIM &#x003C; HERE THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF THE KINGS OF ISRAEL AND JUDAH &#x003E;</small>. Thus he repudiated circumcision, extended the foreskin (to disguise circumcision), and entered the orifice through which he had come out.<sup><xref rid="fn714">40</xref></sup> About Zedekiah, it is written (in II Chron. 36:12): <small>AND HE DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD HIS GOD</small>&#x2026;. Here are the seven wicked men; therefore, the prophet &#x003C; Jeremiah &#x003E; cries and says (in Jer. 15:9): <small>SHE WHO BEARS SEVEN IS WRETCHED</small>.

Samuel bar Nahman said: There is a tradition &#x003C; handed down &#x003E; through the children of Esau that they will only fall at the hands of the children of Rachel.<sup><xref rid="fn721">47</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Jer. 49:20): <small>SURELY [YOUNGEST OF] THE FLOCK SHALL DRAG THEM AWAY</small>. Now, &#x003C; what &#x003E; if the &#x003C; other &#x003E; tribes go to court with Esau and say to him: Why did you persecute your brother? Then he says to them: [Why] did you persecute your brother Joseph? So they have no more advantage than he. But when he comes to Joseph, &#x003C; Joseph &#x003E; says to him: Why did you persecute your brother; and he is unable to give him an answer. And, if you should say that he did evil to you, &#x003C; he can &#x003E; also &#x003C; say &#x003E;: My brothers awarded me evil, while I awarded them good. Immediately he becomes silent, as stated (in Is. 47:14): <small>SEE, THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE STRAW</small>. This refers to Esau, of whom it is stated (in Obad. 18): <small>AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW</small>. (Is. 47:14, cont.:) <small>FIRE CONSUMES THEM</small>. This refers to Jacob [who is called fire], of whom it is stated (in Obad. 18): <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE</small> &#x007B;who is called fire&#x007D;. &#x007B;(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME</small>&#x2026;. Does this not refer to Joseph, of whom it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME?</small>&#x007D; [(Is. 47:14, cont.:) <small>THEY SHALL NOT SAVE THEMSELVES FROM THE POWER OF THE FLAME</small>. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME</small>&#x2026;.]</p>
<title>7.16 Genesis 30:22ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 30:22:) <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL&#x2026;. AND OPENED (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) HER WOMB</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is it legitimate for one to wipe off a table on the Sabbath with a sponge.<sup><xref rid="fn722">48</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab</italic>. 21:3): <small>IN THE CASE OF A SPONGE, IF IT HAS A LEATHER HANDLE, ONE MAY WIPE WITH IT; BUT, IF NOT, ONE MAY NOT WIPE WITH IT</small>. Now, if leather is not sewn to it, when one comes to wipe [on the Sabbath], the water enters. Then &#x007B;it would absorb&#x007D; [he would press down], the water would flow out, and he would be found squeezing on the Sabbath. Ergo (ibid.): <small>IF IT HAS A LEATHER HANDLE, ONE MAY WIPE WITH IT; [BUT, IF NOT, ONE MAY NOT WIPE WITH IT]</small>, lest he squeeze and the water flows out. Come and see the works of the Holy One, that they are unlike the work of flesh and blood. In the case of flesh and blood, when one squeezes (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>TsR</italic>) on a sponge, the water flows down; &#x003C; if &#x003E; one opens his hand, the water does not flow down. With the Holy One, however, this is not so. If he squeezes, the water does not flow down, as stated (in Job 12:15): <small>BEHOLD, HE SHALL SHUT UP (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>TsR</italic>) THE WATERS SO THAT THEY DRY UP</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 11:17): <small>AND HE SHALL SHUT UP (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>TsR</italic>) THE HEAVENS SO THAT THERE SHALL BE NO RAIN</small>. However, if he opens up (<italic>PTH</italic>), then &#x003C; the waters &#x003E; come down, as stated (in Deut. 28:12): <small>THE LORD SHALL OPEN (<italic>PTH</italic>) FOR YOU &#x003C; HIS BOUNTEOUS TREASURY, THE HEAVENS, TO GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND IN ITS SEASON &#x003E;</small>. R. Johanan said: There are four keys (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) in the hand of the Holy One which he has not delivered to the humans in the world, they are the following: the key of rains, the key of sustenance, the key of graves, and the key of barren women.<sup><xref rid="fn723">49</xref></sup> Yet, when they were needed, the Holy One delivered them to the righteous. The key of rain he delivered to Elijah, as stated (in I Kings 17:1): <small>DURING THESE YEARS THERE SHALL BE NEITHER DEW NOR RAIN EXCEPT AT MY (Elijah&#x2019;s) WORD</small>. The key of sustenance he delivered to Noah, as stated (in Gen. 6:21): <small>FOR YOUR PART, TAKE SOME OF EVERY KIND OF FOOD THAT IS EATEN&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND IT SHALL BE FOOD FOR YOU AND FOR THEM &#x003E;</small>. The key of graves he delivered to Ezekiel, as stated (in Ezek. 37:3-4 [4-5]): <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY UNTO THEM: O DRY BONES &#x2026; &#x003C; YOU SHALL LIVE AGAIN &#x003E;</small>. The key of barren women he delivered to Elisha, as stated (in II Kings 4:16): <small>&#x003C; THEN HE (Elisha) SAID &#x003E; AT THIS SEASON NEXT YEAR YOU SHALL BE EMBRACING A SON</small>. Where is it shown that the Holy One has not delivered them to the humans in the world, but unlocks (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) them by himself? In respect to the key (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) of rains? Where it is stated (in Deut. 28:12): <small>THE LORD WILL OPEN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) FOR YOU &#x003C; HIS BOUNTEOUS TREASURY, THE HEAVENS, TO GIVE RAIN FOR YOUR LAND IN ITS SEASON &#x003E;</small>. In respect to the key of sustenance? Where it is stated (in Ps. 145:16): <small>&#x003C; YOU &#x003E; OPEN (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) YOUR HAND &#x003C; AND SATISFY THE DESIRE OF EVERY LIVING BEING &#x003E;</small>. In respect to the key of graves? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 37:12): <small>&#x003C; THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD &#x003E; : BEHOLD, I WILL OPEN (<italic>PTH</italic>) YOUR GRAVES &#x003C; AND RAISE YOU UP OUT FROM YOUR GRAVES &#x003E;</small>. And in respect to the key of barren women, how is it shown? From what is written on the matter (in Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND OPENED (rt.: <italic>PTH</italic>) HER WOMB</small>.</p>
<title>7.17 Genesis 30:22ff., Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 55:19 [18]): <small>HE HAS DELIVERED MY LIFE IN SAFETY (literally: IN PEACE) FROM THOSE WHO COME ABOUT ME; FOR THOSE WITH ME ARE MANY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn724">50</xref></sup> Who spoke this verse? David spoke it when his son Absalom rebelled against him and said to him (in II Sam. 15:7): <small>PLEASE LET ME GO TO FULFILL MY VOW WHICH I VOWED TO THE LORD IN HEBRON</small>. Then his father said to him (in vs. 9): <small>GO IN PEACE; SO HE AROSE AND WENT TO HEBRON</small>. Absalom said to him: I desire one thing from you, that you give me two elders to go with me so that I may do whatever I do in accordance with them. He wrote him [a letter] for two elders go with him from any city that he wanted. He took the letter and went to each and every city. Then, when he saw two of the oldest and best in the city, he would show them [the letter] and say to them: See what my father has written for me. However, because I like you a lot, I want you. This he did in each and every city until he had gotten two hundred elders, as stated (in vs. 11): <small>WITH ABSALOM THERE WENT TWO HUNDRED MEN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TWO HUNDRED MEN?</small> R. Huna said in the name of R. Hiyya bar Abba: He took two hundred Sanhedrin presidents with him, just as you say (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY MEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn725">51</xref></sup> (II Sam. 15:11, cont.:) <small>BEING INVITED, THEY WENT IN THEIR NAIVETE AND KNEW NOTHING</small>, since they did not know where they were going. Absalom made a feast for them; and &#x003C; each &#x003E; pair of elders sat down with one of those who had rebelled along with him between them. Then that one who was reclining between the pair of them would say: How fine Absalom would be as king. Let us leave David and go with him. What did they do? Even though they were with him, they would only pray for David. And what did they pray? May it be your will, O Lord God, that we fall by David&#x2019;s hand and not that David fall by our hand&#x0021; It is therefore stated (by David in Ps. 55:19): <small>FOR THOSE WITH ME ARE MANY</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 55:19 [18]): <small>HE HAS DELIVERED MY LIFE IN SAFETY</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Rachel. Rachel said: <small>HE HAS DELIVERED MY LIFE IN SAFETY</small>, by virtue of the sons which the Holy One has given me. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR THOSE WITH ME ARE MANY</small>, because Jacob and Leah were praying for me. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL</small>.</p>
<title>7.18 Genesis 30:22ff., Part III</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 98:3): <small>HE HAS REMEMBERED HIS LOVING-KINDNESS AND FAITHFULNESS &#x003C; TOWARD THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; These words &#x003E; speak about Joshua (<italic>Yehoshua</italic>&#x2018;), who stemmed from Rachel&#x2019;s children. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH HAVE SEEN THE VICTORY (<italic>yeshu&#x2018;ah</italic>) OF OUR GOD</small>. That victory is the one that Joshua accomplished, the one about which it is stated (in Josh. 10:12): <small>O SUN, STAND STILL AT GIBEON</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 98:3): <small>HE HAS REMEMBERED HIS LOVING-KINDNESS</small>. The remembrance is of our mother Rachel. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TOWARD THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>, as stated (in Ruth 4:11) <small>&#x003C; RACHEL AND LEAH &#x003E;, BOTH OF WHOM BUILT UP THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL</small>.</p>
<title>7.19 Genesis 30:22ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:22): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in vs. 1)? <small>WHEN RACHEL SAW THAT SHE HAD BORNE JACOB NO CHILDREN&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND SHE SAID TO JACOB: GIVE ME CHILDREN &#x003E;, OR ELSE I SHALL DIE</small>. Our masters have said: From here you learn that all who are childless are regarded as dead. Thus it is written of Hannah (in I Sam. 2:6): <small>THE LORD BRINGS DEATH AND GIVES LIFE</small>. Hannah simply said this: Before he gave me a son, I was one of the dead. Now that he has given me a son, I have been reckoned with the living. Rachel said to Jacob (in Gen. 30:1-2): <small>GIVE ME CHILDREN, OR ELSE I SHALL DIE. THEN JACOB&#x2019;S ANGER WAS KINDLED AGAINST RACHEL</small>. The Holy Spirit says (in Job 15:2): <small>DOES A ONE WHO IS WISE ANSWER WITH WINDY KNOWLEDGE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn726">52</xref></sup> Jacob said to Rachel: Am I the viceroy<sup><xref rid="fn727">53</xref></sup> of the Holy One? (Gen. 30:2, cont.:) <small>AM I TAKING GOD&#x2019;S PLACE</small>? The Holy One said to him: By your life, in the words you have uttered, <small>AM I TAKING GOD&#x2019;S PLACE</small>? In these very words her son is &#x003C; going to &#x003E; rise up and say to your children (in Gen. 50:19): <small>AM I TAKING GOD&#x2019;S PLACE</small>? She said to him: Did your father, Isaac, do this to your mother, Rebekah? Did not the two of them stand and pray for each other? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:21): <small>THEN ISAAC ENTREATED THE LORD ON BEHALF OF HIS WIFE</small>. You also should pray unto the <small>LORD</small> for me&#x0021; And did not your grandfather Abraham do so for Sarah? He said to her: Sarah brought a rival wife into her house. She said to him (in Gen. 30:3): If so, <small>HERE IS MY MAID BILHAH; GO IN TO HER</small>. He did not do so; but, when she had &#x003C; actually &#x003E; given him her bondmaid, she immediately (in vs. 5) conceived and gave birth. (Gen. 30:6:) <small>THEN RACHEL SAID: GOD HAS JUDGED ME</small>. He has judged me and found me guilty; he has judged me and found me innocent. He has judged me and found me guilty by not giving me a son; he has judged me and found me innocent by giving my bondmaid a son. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME DAN</small> (i.e., he has judged). Then she conceived and gave birth to Naphtali, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 8) <small>RACHEL SAID: WITH SUPERNATURAL WRESTLINGS (<italic>naphtule</italic>) I HAVE WRESTLED (<italic>niphtalti</italic>) &#x003C; WITH MY SISTER &#x003E;</small>. &#x007B;&#x003C; Naphtali &#x003E; should be interpreted as &#x003C; the Greek word &#x003E; <italic>nymphe</italic>, since in the Mediterranean cities they call a bride a <italic>nymphe</italic>.&#x007D; <italic>Naphtulai</italic> &#x003C; means in translation &#x003E; that the wedding canopy was mine. Now on each Wednesday<sup><xref rid="fn728">54</xref></sup> she was adorned to enter it, but &#x003C; it was &#x003E; Leah &#x003C; who &#x003E; entered.<sup><xref rid="fn729">55</xref></sup> Therefore, &#x003C; it was &#x003E; &#x201C;my wedding canopy&#x201D; (<italic>naphtulay</italic>), but her sister entered. (Gen. 30:8:) <small>&#x003C; AND RACHEL SAID: WITH SUPERNATURAL WRESTLINGS (<italic>naphtule</italic>) I HAVE WRESTLED (<italic>niphtalti</italic>) &#x003E; WITH MY SISTER; &#x007B;AND&#x007D; I HAVE ALSO PREVAILED. SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME NAPHTALI</small>. Why Naphtali (<italic>NPTLY</italic>)? Because from their border they put a crown on the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn730">56</xref></sup> about which it is written (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS (<italic>NPT</italic>) OF THE COMB</small>. When Leah saw that she had borne six, she said: The Holy One has made this agreement with Jacob, to raise up twelve tribes. Now here I have borne six sons; and the two bondmaids, four. That makes ten. Then Leah conceived &#x003C; again &#x003E;. Our masters have said: She conceived a male.<sup><xref rid="fn731">57</xref></sup> Leah said: Here I have conceived, but my sister Rachel has not given birth.<sup><xref rid="fn732">58</xref></sup> What did Leah do? She began to pray for mercy upon her sister Rachel. She said to let whatever should be within her<sup><xref rid="fn733">59</xref></sup> belly become female, and let not my sister Rachel be prevented from giving birth to a son. The Holy One said to her: By your life, you have had mercy upon you sister. See, I am making that which is within your belly female, and &#x003C; I &#x003E; am remembering her in this regard. (Gen. 30:21:) <small>THEN AFTERWARDS SHE BORE A DAUGHTER AND CALLED HER NAME DINAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>DINAH (<italic>DYNH</italic>)</small>? That she argued (<italic>DYNH</italic>) against giving birth to a son on condition that Rachel bear a son; for thus it is written below (in Gen. 30:22-23): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED RACHEL&#x2026;. SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE A SON</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE &#x003C; A SON &#x003E;</small>? &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; likens her giving birth to her conception. Just as her conception was painless, so was her giving birth painless. (Gen. 30:23, cont.:) <small>THEN SHE SAID: GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HAS TAKEN AWAY</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn734">60</xref></sup> Simply that before a wife gives birth there is shame found within her house. How? When she breaks a vessel in her house, whom does she have to blame? When she gives birth, she blames her child. She therefore said: <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>.</p>
<title>7.20 Genesis 30:22ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:23): <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY &#x003C; MY SHAME &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn735">61</xref></sup> In the hour that Rebekah gave birth to Jacob and Esau, two daughters were born to Laban. They sent letters to each other, saying: You have given birth to two daughters; and I, to two sons. Let us give them to each other. When Leah heard about Esau&#x2019;s conduct, she would cry; but, when Rachel heard about Jacob&#x2019;s conduct she would be happy. [Where is it shown that Leah cried? Where it is stated] (in Gen. 29:17): <small>AND LEAH&#x2019;S EYES WERE WEAK</small>. The interpreter of R. Jose interpreted &#x003C; the verse as follows &#x003E; :<sup><xref rid="fn736">62</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>WEAK</small>? Bleary &#x007B;i.e., circular&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn737">63</xref></sup> R. Johanan said to him: You did not interpret well. Then what is the meaning of <small>WEAK</small> (<italic>rakkot</italic>)? Long (<italic>arukkot</italic>), because all that the Holy One gave her (through her children) was long &#x003C; -lasting &#x003E; : high priesthood, kingship, and anointing oil. Then, when Leah gave birth for Jacob, Rachel was depressed, saying: Perhaps Esau will take her,<sup><xref rid="fn738">64</xref></sup> since I have not given birth to a child. But when she had given birth to Joseph, she said (in Gen. 30:23): <small>GOD HAS TAKEN AWAY MY SHAME</small>. Now there is no shame but foreskin, as stated (concerning foreskin in Gen. 34:14): <small>FOR THAT IS SHAME TO US</small>. (Gen. 30:24:) <small>SO SHE CALLED HIS NAME JOSEPH (<italic>Yosef</italic>), SAYING: MAY THE LORD ADD (<italic>yosef</italic>) ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. The Holy Spirit foresaw &#x003C; here &#x003E; that she would only bear one other son.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (<italic>yosef</italic>) [ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>. Resh Laqish said:] The addition of the Holy One is greater than the original &#x003C; gift &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn739">65</xref></sup> From whom do you learn this? From Hezekiah, whose reign was fourteen years; but, when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. Thus it is stated (in II Kings 20:6): <small>AND I WILL ADD FIFTEEN YEARS TO YOUR LIFE</small>. Ergo, the addition is greater than the original. And so you find in the case of Benjamin, when his mother said to him (in Gen. 30:24): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (<italic>yosef</italic>) ANOTHER SON FOR ME</small>, the Holy One also added for her ten tribes from him and two tribes from Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn740">66</xref></sup> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One raised up twelve tribes from Rachel, ten from Benjamin and two from Joseph. And where is it shown that &#x003C; the ten &#x003E; were sons of Benjamin? Where it is written (in I Sam. 9:21): <small>THEN SAUL ANSWERED AND SAID: AM I NOT A BENJAMINITE, FROM THE SMALLEST OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, [AND MY CLAN THE SMALLEST OF THE CLANS OF THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN]</small>? And another verse says (in Jud. 20:12): <small>AND &#x007B;SAUL&#x007D; [THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL] SENT [PEOPLE] AMONG ALL THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN, SAYING</small>. When the prophets saw that the addition was greater than the original, they began to bless Israel with the addition (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>). Moses our Master said (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS ADD (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>) TO YOUR NUMBERS &#x003C; A THOUSAND TIMES &#x003E; MORE THAN YOU ARE</small>. David also said (in Ps. 115:14): <small>MAY THE LORD ADD (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>) TO YOUR NUMBERS, YOURS AND YOUR CHILDREN&#x2019;S ALSO</small>. In the world to come as well the Holy One will gather the exiles of Israel by means of this word (with the Hebrew root <italic>YSP</italic>). Thus it is stated (in Is. 11:11): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: <italic>YSP</italic>) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE</small>.</p>
<title>7.21 Genesis 31:3ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>. Let our master instruct us: In the case of an Israelite courtyard with star-worshiping foreigners dwelling within it, is it right that its eruv is a &#x003C; legitimate &#x003E; eruv? Thus have our masters taught:<sup><xref rid="fn741">67</xref></sup> In the case of an Israelite courtyard with star-worshipping foreigners dwelling within it, it is forbidden for an Israelite to use anything within it until he has acquired a right &#x003C; to the property &#x003E; from the star-worshipping foreigner.<sup><xref rid="fn742">68</xref></sup> Why? Because it is written (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED &#x003C; I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One will not assign his name in the midst of those who serve idols. Rather (according to Lev. 20:32): <small>THAT I MAY BE SANCTIFIED IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Thus, you are not to associate with the wicked ones because the Holy One will not assign his name in their midst. You know yourself that it is so.<sup><xref rid="fn743">69</xref></sup> R. Eleazar ben Padat said in the name of R. Jose ben &#x007B;Qisma&#x007D; [Zimra]: During the whole time that Lot was attached to Abraham, you never find a divine oracle being conferred upon Abraham. As soon as Lot was separated from him (in Gen. 13:11-13), the divine word was conferred upon him, as stated (in Gen. 13:14). <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM AFTER LOT HAD DEPARTED FROM HIM</small>. And so you find that, when Jacob went away to Mesopotamia to go to Laban, he spent twenty years at his place; but all the time that Jacob was in Laban&#x2019;s house, the Holy One did not speak with him. Then Jacob did some pondering and said: So the Holy One has forsaken me&#x0021; Not so. The Holy One said to me (in Gen. 28:15): <small>AND SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. The Holy One knew what he pondered in his heart. The Holy One said to him: Do you want me to be with you? Separate yourself from Laban the Wicked, and I will be with you. Where is it shown? Where they read on the matter (in Gen. 31:3): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: &#x003C; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>7.22 Genesis 31:3ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB: &#x003C; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN &#x003E;, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>.] It is written (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>. [R. Tanhuma b. R. Jose said: Come and see what the Holy One is saying to Israel (in Lev. 19:28): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MAKE A GASH IN YOUR FLESH FOR THE DEAD</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I AM THE LORD</small>. He is sure to pay you a reward. Is there a palate (i.e., a saying) sweeter than this&#x0021; Someone may say to his friend: If you deform (rt.: <italic>NWL</italic>) yourself, I will give you a reward; but the Holy One has said: If you do not degrade yourselves, <small>AND</small> (ibid.) <small>&#x003C; NOT MAKE &#x003E; A GASH &#x003C; IN YOUR FLESH &#x003E; FOR THE DEAD</small>&#x2026;. I will give you a reward. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>. R. Abbahu said: See what is written (in Lev. 20:26): <small>SO I HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE &#x003C; OTHER &#x003E; PEOPLES &#x003C; TO BE MINE &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn744">70</xref></sup> See the attributes of the Holy One. If it had been written, &#x201C;So I have set the &#x003C; other &#x003E; peoples apart from you,&#x201D; there would have been no hope for a star-worshipping gentile, and no proselyte would have become a Jew. How so? &#x003C; Consider the case of &#x003E; someone who has figs. If he picks out the bad from the good, in the end he will not return to the bad ones; but, if he picks out the good ones, if he wants to pick out some of the bad, he picks them out. Therefore, the Holy One has said (in Lev. 20:26): <small>SO I HAVE SET YOU APART FROM THE &#x003C; OTHER &#x003E; PEOPLES</small>. He has given a hint to those gentiles who wish to become Jews. Is there a palate (i.e., a saying) more beautiful than this? Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.] R. Aha said:<sup><xref rid="fn745">71</xref></sup> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, when he gives a <italic>donativa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn746">72</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a valuable gift&#x007D;, he does not give a <italic>stativa</italic><sup><xref rid="fn747">73</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a good rest&#x007D;; and, when he gives a <italic>stativa</italic>, he does not give a <italic>donativa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn748">74</xref></sup> But the Holy One gives a <italic>stativa</italic> and gives a <italic>donativa</italic>. He has given the Sabbath rest, and he has given a double portion of bread. What is written (in Exod. 16:29)? <small>OBSERVE THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH; [HE THEREFORE GIVES YOU BREAD FOR TWO DAYS ON THE SIXTH DAY]</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.</p>
<p>R. Johanan said: The Holy One said (in Lev. 19:3): <small>AND YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS. I AM THE LORD &#x003C; YOUR GOD &#x003E;</small>. I am sure to give a reward. And with what do you keep it? With food, drink, and clean clothing. Then I give you a reward. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.</p>
<p>R. Levi said: Look at the word which the Holy One gave to the children of Adam. What is written (in Ezek. 18:21): <small>MOREOVER, WHEN THE WICKED ONE REPENTS &#x003C; OF ALL THE SINS THAT HE HAS COMMITTED, KEEPS ALL MY STATUTES, AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT, HE SHALL LIVE &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said (in vs. 22): <small>ALL HIS TRANSGRESSIONS WHICH HE HAS COMMITTED SHALL NOT BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM. &#x007B;ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUS ACTS&#x007D; [BY HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS] WHICH HE HAS PRACTICED, &#x007B;HE HAS LIVED&#x007D; HE SHALL LIVE &#x007B;AND NOT DIE</small>&#x007D;. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.</p>
<p>Resh Laqish said: Could you hear of anything greater than this? What is written (in Ezek. 33:19)? <small>AND WHEN A WICKED PERSON TURNS BACK FROM HIS WICKEDNESS [AND DOES WHAT IS JUST AND RIGHT, ON ACCOUNT OF THESE THINGS HE SHALL LIVE]</small>. &#x201C;And he shall live&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>ON ACCOUNT OF THESE THINGS HE SHALL LIVE</small>. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; because the Holy One makes them &#x003C; to be &#x003E; merit for him &#x003C; that &#x003E; he shall live by means of them. Ergo (in Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 5:16): <small>HIS PALATE (i.e., what he says) IS MOST SWEET</small>: If a king of flesh and blood has a friend, he loves him. So, if that friend becomes ill,<sup><xref rid="fn749">75</xref></sup> he sends away to inquire after his health. Then, if he loves him even more, he goes to visit him. &#x003C; But &#x003E; if he went out into lodgings,<sup><xref rid="fn750">76</xref></sup> is it thinkable that the king would go out with him? However, &#x003C; it was &#x003E; the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, &#x003C; who &#x003E; loved Jacob, as stated (in Mal. 1:2): <small>YET I HAVE LOVED JACOB</small>. When Deborah<sup><xref rid="fn751">77</xref></sup> died (in Gen. 35:8), &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; came to visit him; and, when he went out into lodgings, he was with him. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:15): <small>AND SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. When he returned, he was with him, as stated (in Gen. 31:3): <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB: &#x003C; RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS WHERE YOU WERE BORN &#x003E;, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>7.23 Genesis 31:3ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 31:3:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB&#x2026;.</small> This text is related (to Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD; I SAID: YOU ARE MY REFUGE, MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Who uttered this verse? David uttered it. <small>MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>: He calls the land of Israel <small>THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Why? Resh Laqish said in the name of R. Eleazar haQappar: Because the dead in the land of Israel are the first to come alive in the days of the Messiah. For this reason he calls it <small>THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn752">78</xref></sup> David said: I yearn to dwell within it, but Saul does not allow me. Rather (according to I Sam. 26:19): <small>FOR THEY HAVE DRIVEN ME OUT TODAY SO THAT I SHOULD HAVE NO SHARE IN THE LORD&#x2019;S INHERITANCE</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD</small>; and, because I did so, I became king over Israel.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 142:6 [5]): <small>I CRIED UNTO YOU, O LORD</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Jacob. When he set out from his father&#x2019;s house, what does it say (in Gen. 28:20)? <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>&#x2026;. He raised his eyes to the Holy One &#x003C; and &#x003E; said (in Ps. 142:6 [5], cont.): <small>YOU ARE MY REFUGE</small>. He said to him (in Gen. 28:15): <small>SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>&#x2026;. (Ps. 124:6 [5], cont.:) <small>MY PORTION IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Now Jacob was hoping to return to the land of Israel. Jacob said: With permission I went out. If I do not get permission, I am not returning. The Holy One said: Do you want permission? Permission you have. (Gen. 31:3, cont.:) <small>RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR PARENTS</small>. Did you come for anything but the tribes? See, you have them.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Did you only come for Rachel? See, you have &#x007B;the right to&#x007D; Rachel.</p>
<p>Another interpretation. Were you only waiting until Esau&#x2019;s adversary (<italic>Satan</italic>) was born?<sup><xref rid="fn753">79</xref></sup> See, he has been born.</p>
<title>7.24 Genesis 31:3ff., Part IV</title>
<p>What is written above about the matter (in Gen. 30:25)? <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN RACHEL HAB BORNE JOSEPH, THAT JACOB SAID UNTO LABAN: SEND ME AWAY &#x003C; THAT I MAY GO TO MY OWN HOME AND MY LAND &#x003E;</small>. But, if you do not want to send me away, I am going without your permission. Laban said to him: With none of the sons that you sired except Joseph, have you said to me: <small>SEND ME AWAY</small>&#x0021; He told him that he would bring Esau the Wicked to account. Ergo (in Gen. 30:25): <small>SEND ME AWAY THAT I MAY GO &#x003C; TO MY OWN HOME AND MY LAND &#x003E;</small>. (Gen. 30:27:) <small>BUT LABAN SAID UNTO HIM&#x2026;. I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION &#x003C; THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE &#x003E;</small>. On that very day at Jacob&#x2019;s feet he had found a treasure<sup><xref rid="fn754">80</xref></sup> which would bring luck. He therefore says (in Gen. 30:27): <small>I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION</small>. R. Berekhyah said: Laban had learned by divination, but Jacob did not know it. And what was he concerned about? (Gen. 30:27:) <small>THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE</small>. Laban said (in vs. 28): <small>NAME YOUR WAGES</small>. He said to him: You get the speckled &#x003C; of the flock &#x003E; and I get the mottled from whatever dams give birth. (Gen. 30:36:) <small>AND JACOB WAS PASTURING THE FLOCK OF LABAN THAT REMAINED</small>. What was it <small>THAT REMAINED (<italic>HNWTRWT</italic>)</small>? Resh Laqish said: The dams who were old, sterile, &#x003C; and &#x003E; sick.<sup><xref rid="fn755">81</xref></sup> What is written (in vs. 37)? <small>THEN JACOB TOOK A &#x003C; FRESH &#x003E; SHOOT OF WHITE POPLAR</small>. R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said: He fashioned an image; and, just as he fashioned, so they gave birth. He only failed to give them breath. They gave birth and multiplied before him. Laban went back on his &#x003C; word &#x003E;. Where is it shown? Where Jacob said so (in Gen. 31:7): <small>AND HE CHANGED MY WAGES</small>&#x2026;. What did Jacob do when he delayed over him?<sup><xref rid="fn756">82</xref></sup> He sent after the children of his house, as stated (in Gen. 31:4): <small>SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH TO THE FIELD</small>. Why not within his house? R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said: For three things I like the children of the East:<sup><xref rid="fn757">83</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>They do not bite off meat with their teeth but cut it with a knife.</li>
<li>When one kisses his friend, he kisses him, not on his mouth, but on his hand.</li>
<li>When one wants to get advice, he gets it, not in the house, but in the field (to prevent eavesdropping).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore stated (in Gen. 31:4): <small>SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH TO THE FIELD</small>, to an open place.</p>
<p>(Gen. 31:5-8:) <small>AND HE SAID TO THEM: I SEE THAT YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S MANNER &#x003C; TOWARDS ME IS NOT AS IT WAS BEFORE &#x003E;&#x2026;. MOREOVER, YOU KNOW &#x003C; THAT I HAVE SERVED YOUR FATHER WITH ALL MY STRENGTH &#x003E;. YET YOUR FATHER HAS CHEATED ME&#x2026;. IF HE SHOULD SAY THIS: &#x003C; THE SPECKLED SHALL BE YOUR WAGES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Berekhyah said: &#x201C;If he said this&#x201D; is not written here but, <small>IF HE SHOULD SAY THIS</small>. Now the angel (of vs. 11) had said to Jacob: If Laban should say this, by your life, I will do for you just as you want.</p>
<p>(Gen. 31:1:) <small>NOW HE HEARD THE THINGS THAT LABAN&#x2019;S CHILDREN WERE SAYING: JACOB HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER</small>. What is the meaning of <small>JACOB HAS TAKEN</small>? R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said that the ministering angels were shoulders for Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn758">84</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>JACOB HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER, AND FROM WHAT BELONGS TO OUR FATHER HE HAS ACQUIRED ALL THIS WEALTH (<italic>kavod</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn759">85</xref></sup> What was the <small>WEALTH (<italic>kavod</italic>)</small>? R. Simon said: &#x003C; Wealth &#x003E; from silver and gold. But did Laban have silver and gold? He had nothing but &#x003C; animals of the &#x003E; flock. Concerning what does it say: silver and gold? It is simply that the flocks of our father Jacob were different from the flocks of Laban. &#x201C;And he had a lot of cattle&#x201D; is not written here (in this context, i.e., in Gen. 30:43) but, <small>AND HE HAD LARGE (<italic>RBWT</italic>) FLOCKS</small>, in that they were fruitful and multiplying (<italic>RBWT</italic>). Moreover, the nations of the world had been coming to give Jacob silver and gold in order to acquire some of his flock. R. Simon said: There is no wealth (<italic>kavod</italic>) but silver and gold, as stated (in Nahum 2:10 [9]): <small>PLUNDER SILVER&#x0021; PLUNDER GOLD&#x0021; &#x003C; THERE IS NO END TO TREASURE, WEALTH (<italic>kavod</italic>) OUT OF EVERY PRECIOUS VESSEL</small> &#x003E;. So how many &#x003C; animals of the &#x003E; flock did he have? R. Tanhuma bar Abba said: a hundred and twenty times ten thousand (<italic>RBW</italic>&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn760">86</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (in Gen. 30:43): <small>SO THE MAN (Joseph) BECAME VERY VERY PROSPEROUS</small>. Now &#x003C; a single &#x003E; <small>VERY</small> is said concerning Egypt (in Exod. 1:20): <small>SO THE PEOPLE MULTIPLIED (rt.: <italic>RBH</italic>) AND BECAME VERY NUMEROUS</small>; [And (according to Exod. 12:37) those &#x003C; numbered six hundred thousand, i.e., &#x003E; sixty times ten thousand (<italic>RBW</italic>&#x2019;). But here (in Gen. 30:43) it is stated: <small>VERY VERY</small> for a total of a hundred and twenty times ten thousand (<italic>RBW</italic>&#x2019;).] How many sheep dogs did he have? R. Abba bar Kahana said: Three hundred and nine. R. Tanhuma said: Where is it shown? <italic>Q</italic> (&#x003D; 100) <italic>B</italic> (&#x003D; 2) <italic>Z</italic> (&#x003D; 7) <italic>R</italic> (&#x003D; 200).<sup><xref rid="fn761">87</xref></sup> Hence the reckoning. (Gen. 30:43:) <small>SO THE MAN (Jacob) BECAME VERY VERY PROSPEROUS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BECAME PROSPEROUS (rt.: <italic>PRT</italic>)</small>? That the Holy One broke through (rt.: <italic>PRT</italic>) the wall of &#x003C; this &#x003E; world and said to him: So do I break through (rt.: <italic>PRT</italic>) into the world to come for your children, as stated (in Micah 2:13): <small>THE ONE WHO BREAKS THROUGH (rt.: <italic>PRT</italic>) GOES UP AHEAD OF THEM</small>.</p>

<p>[(Gen. 32:4 [3]:) <small>THEN JACOB SENT MESSENGERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn762">1</xref></sup> This text is related (to Prov. 25:26): <small>A MUDDY SPRING, A POLLUTED SOURCE, IS A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WHO WAVERS BEFORE SOMEONE WICKED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn763">2</xref></sup> R. Judah b. R. Simon said: Just like a muddy spring and a polluted source, so it is when a righteous person wavers before someone wicked. Another interpretation: &#x003C; Just as &#x003E; it is possible for a spring to be muddy and a source to be polluted; &#x003C; so &#x003E; it is possible for a righteous person to waver before someone wicked. And who was this &#x003C; waverer &#x003E;? This was Jacob when he came from Paddan-aram. What does he &#x003C; do &#x003E; ? He sends out and says to Esau (according to Gen. 32:5 [4]): <small>THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO MY LORD ESAU</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in vs. 3): <small>THEN JACOB SENT MESSENGERS</small>.</p>
<title>8.2 Genesis 32:4ff. (3ff.), Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 32:4:) <small>THEN JACOB SENT</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Prov. 26:17): <small>A PASSER-BY WHO MEDDLES IN A QUARREL NOT HIS OWN IS LIKE ONE WHO SEIZES A DOG BY THE EARS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn764">3</xref></sup> Who is this person? This is Jacob. When he had set out from his father&#x2019;s house, what is written (in Gen. 28:20)? <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW</small>. What did he say (ibid., cont.]:)? <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; Thus did the Holy One respond to him (in vs. 15): <small>SEE I AM WITH YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn765">4</xref></sup> Our masters have said: He responded to him on every &#x003C; point &#x003E; except for sustenance.<sup><xref rid="fn766">5</xref></sup> R. Osha&#x2018;ya said: He also responded to him for sustenance, since it is stated (in Gen. 28:15): <small>FOR I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNTIL (<italic>&#x2018;D &#x2019;ShR</italic>) I HAVE DONE WHAT (&#x2019;<italic>ShR</italic>) I PROMISED YOU</small>. Why did he say two times: (<italic>&#x2019;ShR &#x2018;ShR</italic>)? He spoke, as it were, something difficult. R. Osha&#x2018;ya said: The Holy One said to him: Blessed (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;ShR</italic>) am I and blessed (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;ShR</italic>) are you when I do this thing for you. Again he demanded &#x003C; as a condition &#x003E; (in Gen. 28:21): <small>AND IF I RETURN SAFELY</small>. He said to him (in vs. 15): <small>AND I WILL BRING YOU BACK &#x003C; UNTO THIS LAND &#x003E;</small>. R. Hanina b. R. Isaac said: Blessed (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;ShR</italic>) is one born of woman who has heard this from his Creator. See, whatever he demanded from his Creator he promised him. Then, with these promises, he sends and says (in Gen. 32:5 [4]): <small>THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO MY LORD ESAU</small>. Ergo, it is well stated (in Prov. 25:26): <small>&#x003C; A PASSER-BY WHO MEDDLES IN A QUARREL NOT HIS OWN IS &#x003E; LIKE ONE WHO SEIZES A DOG BY THE EARS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn767">6</xref></sup></p>

<p>(Gen. 32:4:) <small>THEN JACOB SENT ANGELS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn768">7</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 91:11): <small>FOR HE WILL CHARGE HIS ANGELS TO PROTECT YOU IN ALL YOUR WAYS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn769">8</xref></sup> When? When one is in the land of Israel, angels who are in the land of Israel protect him.<sup><xref rid="fn770">9</xref></sup> And from whom do you learn this? From Jacob; for, when he desired to go abroad, what is written (in Gen. 28:12)? <small>THEN HE DREAMED THAT HERE WAS A LADDER&#x2026;. AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON IT</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; should not have said &#x003C; this &#x003E; but &#x201C;descending and ascending.&#x201D; After one descends, he ascends. Yet &#x003C; here &#x003E; it says: <small>ASCENDING AND DESCENDING</small>&#x0021; It said to him: Those angels who had been protecting him in the land of Israel had ascended while others descended to protect him while abroad. He did not stay. So, when he came from Paddan-aram, those angels who had protected him in the land of Israel descended. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:3 [2]): <small>WHEN JACOB SAW THEM (i.e., the angels), HE SAID: &#x003C; THIS IS THE CAMP (<italic>mahaneh</italic>) OF GOD &#x003E;, AND CALLED THE NAME OF THAT PLACE MAHANAIM (i.e., two camps)</small>. &#x201C;<italic>Mahaneh</italic>&#x201D; (i.e., &#x201C;camp&#x201D; in the singular) is not written here but <small>MAHANAIM</small>, &#x003C; a dual form which means &#x003E; &#x201C;two camps,&#x201D; the former &#x003C; which had kept him when abroad &#x003E; and the latter &#x003C; to protect him in the land of Israel &#x003E;. What did Jacob do? When he wanted to send &#x003C; messengers &#x003E; to Esau, he took &#x003C; them &#x003E; from the one &#x003C; camp &#x003E; and from the other, and sent &#x003C; them &#x003E;, as stated (in vs. 4 [3]): <small>THEN JACOB SENT ANGELS</small>. And do not be surprised; for behold, the youngest of his house spoke with the angel. Who was this? This was Joseph; for, when he said to him (in Gen. 37:14): <small>PLEASE GO AND SEE &#x003C; HOW YOUR BROTHERS ARE FARING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; what is written (in vs. 15): <small>THEN A MAN FOUND HIM</small>&#x2026;. <sup><xref rid="fn771">10</xref></sup> What did he say to him (in vs. 17)? <small>THEN THE MAN SAID: THEY HAVE MOVED ON FROM HERE; &#x003C; FOR I HEARD THEM SAYING: LET US GO TO DOTHAN &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>DOTHAN (<italic>DTYNH</italic>)</small>? That he was the same angel who protects the religion (<italic>DT</italic>) of the Lord (<italic>YH</italic>). So neither be surprised about Jacob sending angels nor about Joseph. Yes, even Hagar had the angels speak with her. What is written (in Gen. 21:17)? <small>AND AN ANGEL OF &#x007B;THE LORD&#x007D; [GOD] CALLED UNTO HAGAR</small>. How many angels spoke with her? R. Levi said: &#x003C; Five &#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn772">11</xref></sup> but our masters have said three.<sup><xref rid="fn773">12</xref></sup> Now surely, if the slave woman talks with the angels, do not be surprised at Jacob having sent out angels.

<p>(Gen. 32:5 [4]:) <small>AND HE INSTRUCTED THEM, SAYING: THUS YOU SHALL SAY TO MY LORD ESAU</small>. He called him <small>MY LORD</small>. Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 13:21): <small>WHAT WILL YOU SAY WHEN HE SHALL APPOINT AS YOUR HEADS THOSE WHOM YOU HAD TAUGHT TO BE YOUR FRIENDS</small>? R. Pinhas said: Antoninus gave Our Rabbi (Judah the Prince) the highest honors; but, when Our Rabbi sent me to him, he wrote him a letter and wrote in it: Your servant Judah asks about your welfare. But it displeased Antoninus, namely, that he called himself a servant. He said to him: Do not write again like this. Our Rabbi said to him: I write in such a way to you because I am no better than the patriarch Jacob. When he sent away to Esau, what did he say to him (according to Gen. 32:5 [4])? <small>THUS SAYS YOUR SERVANT JACOB</small>: I have not become an independent authority.<sup><xref rid="fn777">16</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I LIVED WITH LABAN</small>. Not one of the blessings with which your father blessed me has reached me.<sup><xref rid="fn778">17</xref></sup> Your father blessed me (in Gen. 27:28): <small>SO MAY GOD GIVE TO YOU OF THE DEW OF HEAVEN AND THE FAT PLACES OF THE EARTH</small>; yet, I do not have one of them in hand.

Do you hate me merely because of the blessings, [even though one has yet to reach me]? Did he have &#x003C; only &#x003E; one ox and one ass, in that it says (ibid.): <small>I HAVE OX AND ASS</small> &#x2026; (in the singular)?<sup><xref rid="fn779">18</xref></sup> R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ. R. Judah says: It is a figure of speech, as in the case of one who says in a collective sense: Ass went; cock crowed.<sup><xref rid="fn780">19</xref></sup> But R. Nehemiah said: &#x003C; He spoke &#x003E; to him, saying: Here am I, your servant Jacob, humbling myself before you. If you desire it, see, it is fine. But, if not, (ibid.:) <small>I HAVE &#x003C; AN &#x003E; OX AND &#x003C; AN &#x003E; ASS &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;.

SUCH ARE THE MYRIADS OF EPHRAIM, AND SUCH ARE THE THOUSANDS OF MANASSEH &#x003E;</small>. There is an aggadic tradition that Esau will only fall at the hands of Rachel&#x2019;s children. Why? Because it is stated (in Jer. 49:20): <small>SURELY THE YOUNGEST OF YOUR FLOCK SHALL DRAG THEM AWAY</small>. These &#x003C; youngest &#x003E; are the children of Rachel. (Gen. 32:6 [5], cont.:) <small>AND &#x003C; AN &#x003E; ASS</small>. This is the Messianic King, as stated (in Zech. 9:9): <small>REJOICE GREATLY, O DAUGHTER OF ZION, SHOUT ALOUD, O DAUGHTER OF JERUSALEM</small>; &#x003C; behold your king comes &#x003E; &#x2026; <small>HUMBLE AND RIDING UPON AN ASS</small>.

(Gen. 32:6 [5], cont.:) <small>MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES</small>. This &#x003C; also &#x003E; refers to Israel, about which it is stated (in Ps. 123:2): <small>BEHOLD, AS THE EYES OF MALE SLAVES &#x003C; LOOK TO THEIR MASTER&#x2019;S HAND, AS THE EYES OF A FEMALE SLAVE TO THE EYES OF HER MISTRESS, SO DO OUR EYES LOOK TO THE LORD OUR GOD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 32:8 [7]): <small>AND JACOB WAS &#x003C; GREATLY &#x003E; AFRAID</small>.

At that time the Holy One said to him (in Is. 41:10): <small>FEAR NOT, FOR I AM WITH YOU; BE NOT DISMAYED, FOR I AM YOUR GOD. I STRENGTHEN YOU, I HELP YOU&#x2026;. I STRENGTHEN YOU</small> through Michael; <small>I HELP YOU</small> through Gabriel. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND I ALSO UPHOLD YOU THROUGH MY VICTORIOUS RIGHT HAND</small>. (Gen. 28:15:) <small>SEE, I AM WITH YOU</small>. At that time (according to Gen. 32:8 [7]) <small>HE DIVIDED THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM</small>. What did he do? He armed them within and clothed them with linen without. He prepared himself in three things: in prayer, with a gift,<sup><xref rid="fn784">23</xref></sup> and for war.

What is written after that (in vss. 11-12 [10-111])? <small>I AM UNWORTHY OF ALL THE KINDNESSES AND ALL THE FIDELITY&#x2026;. PLEASE DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF MY BROTHER, FROM THE HAND OF ESAU</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have called to me.

<p>(Gen. 32:25 [24]:) <small>SO JACOB WAS LEFT ALONE</small>. What is written above of the matter (in vs. 8 [7])? <small>THEN JACOB WAS VERY FRIGHTENED. WHEN THE HOLY ONE SAW HOW JACOB WAS DEPRESSED</small>, &#x003C; according to what &#x003E; R.

They said to them: We are children of Isaac, and &#x003C; the angels &#x003E; assaulted<sup><xref rid="fn786">25</xref></sup> him (Esau). He said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn787">26</xref></sup> We are children of Abraham&#x2019;s children; they began assaulting him. When &#x003C; Esau&#x2019;s people &#x003E; said: We are brothers of Jacob, they began to leave them alone. Out of respect for Jacob we shall leave you alone. Thus (in Gen. 32:25 [24]): <small>SO JACOB WAS LEFT ALONE</small>. Now Jacob did not know how many miracles the Holy One had done for him. He did nothing; but, when he came in the morning, his brother Esau said to him (in Gen. 33:8): <small>WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY ALL THIS HOST (<italic>MHNH</italic>) WHICH I HAVE MET</small>? &#x201C;Which I have seen&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>WHICH I HAVE MET</small>. Now Jacob did not know that the Holy One had sent angels to him. Rather he was of the opinion that &#x003C; Esau &#x003E; had been occupied with the same gift (<italic>MNHH</italic>) that he had sent to him. He therefore had said to him &#x003C; that it was meant &#x003E; (as stated in ibid., cont.): <small>TO FIND FAVOR IN THE EYES OF MY LORD (Esau)</small>. Then, when the Holy One saw that he was afraid, he sent Michael to him to engage in strife with him. What did the angel do with him? He appeared to him in the likeness of a shepherd.<sup><xref rid="fn788">27</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Gen. 32:25-27 [24-26]): <small>AND SOMEONE WRESTLED WITH HIM &#x003C; UNTIL THE RISING OF THE DAWN &#x003E;. WHEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD NOT PREVAILED AGAINST HIM, &#x003C; HE WRENCHED HIS THIGH AT ITS SOCKET &#x003E;&#x2026;.

He said to them: Behold, let the &#x003C; water in &#x003E; the cave of Paneas be turned to blood; and it was turned to blood in accord with his words.</p>
<p>Woe to the kingdom of Esau when the Holy One sees its works and arises to exact retribution from it. We have found in the case of Egypt that, when the Holy One exacted retribution from them, he exacted retribution from them in the early morning. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 14:24): <small>THEN IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING WATCH &#x003C; THAT THE LORD LOOKED DOWN AT THE HOST OF THE EGYPTIANS FROM THE PILLAR OF FIRE AND THE CLOUD AND CONFOUNDED THE HOST OF THE EGYPTIANS &#x003E;</small>. What is written about Assyria (in II Kings 19:35)? <small>&#x003C; SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THAT NIGHT &#x003E; THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND &#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>&#x2026;. In the case of Media it was at the hands of Mordecai and Esther. In the case of Greece it was at the hands of Mattathias and his sons. But in the case of Edom the Holy One said: There is no creature who will exact retribution from it. I myself will exact retribution against it. Where is it shown? (In Obad. vs. 1-2:) <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH. THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO EDOM: WE HAVE HEARD TIDINGS FROM THE LORD&#x2026;. &#x003C; BEHOLD I WILL MAKE YOU SMALL AMONG THE NATIONS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Berekhyah said: What did Obadiah see exacting retribution from Edom? He saw that, &#x003C; if &#x003E; the Holy One gives back recompense to those who love him, how much the more &#x003C; would he do &#x003E; so for those who hate him. So the Holy Spirit says through Eliphaz the Temanite (in Job 4:1-2): <small>THEN ANSWERED ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE</small><sup><xref rid="fn793">32</xref></sup> <small>AND SAID: IF ONE TRIES YOU IN SOMETHING, DO YOU FIND IT TOO MUCH?</small><sup><xref rid="fn794">33</xref></sup> Eliphaz said to Job: Here you say: In what way am I not like Abraham? Thus have you said (in Job 30:19): <small>&#x003C; GOD &#x003E; HAS CAST ME INTO THE MUD, AND I HAVE BECOME LIKE DUST AND ASHES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn795">34</xref></sup> Do you think that he is comparing you to him? R. Berekhyah said: Transpose the text and interpret it. (Job 30:19a:) <small>AND I HAVE BECOME LIKE DUST AND ASHES</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E;, &#x201C;And he judges you like the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the Tower of Babel), of which it is written in Gen. 11:3): <small>NOW THEY HAD BRICKS FOR STONE &#x003C; AND BITUMEN FOR MORTAR &#x003E;</small>. (Job 30:19a:) <small>&#x003C; GOD &#x003E; HAS CAST ME INTO THE MUD</small>. Eliphaz said to him: Are your works like &#x003C; those of &#x003E; Abraham? Abraham was tried in ten trials and endured all of them, but you &#x003C; have only been &#x003E; in one trial. (Job 4:2-3:) <small>IF ONE TRIES YOU IN SOMETHING, DO YOU FIND IT TOO MUCH? &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; HERE YOU HAVE INSTRUCTED MANY</small>. You would comfort all who were suffering. When a blind person came to you, you would say to him: The Holy One already knows what he is going to do. After all, he &#x003C; was the one who &#x003E; made that person blind. You also used to console him and say to him: If you had built a house and did not want to open windows, who would have protested your right? So the Holy One is going to be glorified in you, as stated (in Is. 35:5): <small>THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED</small>. When a deaf person would come to you, [you would comfort him and say to him:] If you want to make a juglet,<sup><xref rid="fn796">35</xref></sup> &#x003C; but &#x003E; did not want to make ears for it, who would protest your right? So the Holy One is going to be glorified in you, as stated (in ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE EARS OF THE DEAF SHALL BE OPENED</small>. To a lame person you would say (in ibid., vs. 6): <small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A DEER</small>. So you would comfort him. (According to Job 4:4:) <small>YOUR WORDS HAVE UPHELD THE STUMBLING</small>. But now that it affects you, you are dismayed&#x0021; (Job. 4:5:) <small>BUT NOW THAT &#x003C; TROUBLE &#x003E; HAS COME UNTO YOU, YOU FIND IT TOO MUCH</small>&#x2026;. (Job 4:6:) <small>IS NOT YOUR GODLY FEAR YOUR CONFIDENCE</small>? After all, you have said: I am a righteous person; so why does he punish me? Have you ever seen a righteous person perishing? (Job 4:7:) <small>PLEASE RECALL, WHAT INNOCENT ONE HAS PERISHED</small> &#x2026; ? Because Noah was righteous, he was saved from his generation. Abraham was saved from the furnace; Isaac was saved from the knife; Jacob was saved from the angel; Moses was saved from Pharaoh&#x2019;s sword. (Job 4:7:) <small>PLEASE RECALL, WHAT INNOCENT ONE HAS PERISHED</small> &#x2026; ? He delivered Israel from Egypt, but he destroyed the Egyptians (according to Job 4:8): <small>AS [I HAVE SEEN], THOSE WHO PLOW EVIL AND SOW TROUBLE, REAP IT</small>. So what happened to them (according to vs. 9)? <small>BY THE BREATH (<italic>NShMT</italic>) OF GOD THEY PERISH</small>. It is so stated (in Exod. 15:10): <small>YOU BLEW (<italic>NShMT</italic>) WITH YOUR WIND, AND THE SEA COVERED THEM</small>. Also &#x003C; with reference to &#x003E; all the wicked who are going to arise, (according to Job 4:10) &#x003C; there is &#x003E; <small>A LION&#x2019;S ROAR AND A FIERCE LION&#x2019;S VOICE</small>. Job said to him (to Eliphaz): Please look at your father, Esau. He said to him: I am not concerned with him. (According to Ezek. 18:20): <small>&#x007B;THE&#x007D; [A] SON SHALL NOT BEAR THE FATHER&#x2019;S GUILT</small>&#x2026;. (Job 4:11:) <small>THE STRONG LION PERISHES FOR LACK OF PREY</small>. This &#x003C; strong lion &#x003E; is Esau in that he perishes for lack of &#x003C; good &#x003E; works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE OFFSPRING OF THE LIONESS ARE SCATTERED</small>. These &#x003C; offspring &#x003E; are his chieftains. Job said to him: Now in your case, what do you have for yourself? (Job 4:12:) <small>NOW A WORD WAS SECRETLY BROUGHT UNTO ME</small>. I am a prophet. My only concern with him is to rebuke you (according to vs. 13) <small>IN OPINIONS</small><sup><xref rid="fn797">36</xref></sup> <small>FROM NIGHT VISIONS</small>. The Holy One said [to Eliphaz]: You have rebuked my servant Job through a vision. I am raising up a prophet from you who will exact punishment from your father&#x2019;s house (the Edomites) through a vision. [It is so stated (in Obad., vs. 1): <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH</small>.] So R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: What did Obadiah see, since he only prophesied against Edom? The Holy One said: Esau grew up between two righteous people<sup><xref rid="fn798">37</xref></sup> without learning from their works; but Obadiah dwelt between two wicked people<sup><xref rid="fn799">38</xref></sup> without learning from their works. Obadiah would come and exact punishment from Esau. Ergo (in Obad., vs. 1) <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH</small>. And what is written in his prophecy (in vs. 18)? <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE, AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME, AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW; THEY SHALL BURN IT AND CONSUME IT, AND THERE SHALL BE NO SURVIVOR TO THE HOUSE OF ESAU; FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN</small>.</p>
<title>8.9 Genesis 33:18ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE &#x003C; TO THE CITY OF SHECHEM &#x003E;</small>. Let our master instruct us: What is meant by &#x201C;saying something (<italic>DBR</italic>) superfluous on the Sabbath&#x201D;? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab</italic>. 24:5): <small>VOWS MAY BE QUESTIONED</small> (with a view to annulment) <small>WHEN NECESSARY FOR THE SABBATH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn800">39</xref></sup> Ergo: Something (<italic>DBR</italic>) which is not necessary for the Sabbath is not &#x003C; to be &#x003E; questioned.<sup><xref rid="fn801">40</xref></sup> And needless to say, it is forbidden to multiply &#x003C; superfluous &#x003E; things (<italic>DBR</italic>) on the Sabbath. R. Huna said: If someone is corrupted by a transgression, angels of destruction immediately denounce him. It is so stated (in Job 33:22): <small>HIS SOUL DRAWS NEAR TO THE GRAVE</small>. What should one do? Let him be engaged in &#x003C; the study of &#x003E; the Torah and be preserved. And, if he does not know how to recite &#x003C; oral tradition &#x003E;, let him read &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E;. And if he does not know how to read &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E;, let him take hold of the Torah and live, as stated (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM &#x003E; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. Thus, if one is not a Torah scholar, let him be one who takes hold of a Bible teacher and a Mishnah teacher so that they may instruct him in Torah. Then he will merit living, as stated (ibid.): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM &#x003E; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. But, if he is a Torah scholar, the Torah will heal him from every evil and from all suffering. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 15:4): <small>A HEALING TONGUE IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>&#x2026;. This is the Torah. There is no one who would labor at the Torah as our ancestor Jacob &#x003C; did &#x003E;. It is just as you say (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. &#x201C;Dwelling in a tent&#x201D; is not written here but <small>DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. He would go out from the academy (<italic>bet midrash</italic>) of Shem and enter the academy of Eber. Then &#x003C; he would go &#x003E; from the academy of Eber to the academy of Abraham. Therefore, when he had wrestled with the angel &#x003C; and when &#x003E; he was limping on his thigh, as stated (in Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE UPON HIM &#x2026; AND HE WAS LIMPING ON HIS THIGH</small>, the Holy One immediately appeared to him, healed him, and brought him whole to the city of Shechem. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 33:18): <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE &#x003C; TO THE CITY OF SHECHEM &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>8.10 Genesis 33:18ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 121:8): <small>THE LORD WILL PRESERVE YOUR GOING FORTH AND YOUR COMING NOW AND FOREVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn802">41</xref></sup> <small>YOUR GOING FORTH</small>: (According to Gen. 28:10) <small>JACOB WENT FORTH. AND YOUR COMING</small>: (According to Gen. 33:18) <small>JACOB CAME</small>.</p>
<p>(Job 22:28:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. The Holy One has spoken to the righteous (<italic>tsaddiq</italic>) one: If you have done my will, I also will put your will ahead of my own. (Ibid.:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>? The Holy One has said to the righteous one: When I say something and you say something &#x003C; else &#x003E;, I abrogate mine, as it were, to make yours come to pass. Ergo: <small>IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. When was the pronouncement? When &#x003C; Israel &#x003E; committed that act (i.e., of the golden calf). What did the Holy One do? He said to Moses (in Exod. 32:7): <small>GO AND GET DOWN, FOR YOUR PEOPLE &#x003C; WHOM YOU BROUGHT UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003E; HAVE ACTED BASELY</small>. What is written (in vs. 10)? <small>SO NOW LEAVE ME ALONE &#x003C; SO THAT MY ANGER MAY BURN AGAINST THEM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Moses immediately rose up in prayer and supplication, as stated (in vs. 11): <small>BUT MOSES IMPLORED &#x003C; THE LORD HIS GOD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Deut. 9:26, 29:) <small>O LORD GOD, DO NOT DESTROY YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE&#x2026;. FOR THEY ARE YOUR PEOPLE AND YOUR HERITAGE</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: I cannot &#x003C; endure them &#x003E;. He said to him: Just as you have endured them from Egypt up to now, so endure them &#x003C; this time &#x003E;. (Numb. 14:19-20:) <small>PLEASE PARDON THE INIQUITY OF THIS PEOPLE &#x003C; ACCORDING TO YOUR GREAT STEADFAST LOVE, EVEN AS YOU HAVE PARDONED THIS PEOPLE FROM EGYPT UP TO NOW &#x003E;. THEN THE LORD SAID: I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>. Immediately (according to Exod. 32:14): <small>THE LORD REPENTED OF THE EVIL WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO DO TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. (Job 22:28:) <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. Jacob also vowed things before the Holy One. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 28:20-21): <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW, SAYING: &#x003C; IF GOD IS WITH ME, PROTECTS ME ON THIS WAY THAT I GO, AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON &#x003E;, AND IF I RETURN SAFELY UNTO MY FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE, &#x003C; THE LORD SHALL BE MY GOD &#x003E;</small>. He said to him: My father, Isaac, wanted to go abroad, but you did not permit him because he was a whole burnt offering. You appeared to him and said to him (in Gen. 26:2): <small>DO NOT GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. Now I am going away, not for my benefit, but &#x003C; from &#x003E; before my brother lest he kill me. I have received permission from you and from my father. Do not forsake me. (Gen. 28:20:) <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW, &#x003C; SAYING &#x003E;</small>:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x003C; (Ibid.,cont.:) <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>. &#x003E; The Holy One said to him: You have testified concerning me that I have been with you, as stated (in Gen. 31:5): <small>BUT THE GOD OF MY FATHER HAS BEEN WITH ME</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>PROTECTS ME</small>. So I protected you from Laban.</li>
<li>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT</small>. (Cf. Gen. 31:9:) <small>THUS GOD HAS SEIZED YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S CATTLE AND GIVEN THEM TO ME</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small>. (Cf. Gen. 30:35:) <small>BUT ON THAT DAY HE REMOVED THE SPECKLED AND SPOTTED HE-GOATS</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND IF I RETURN SAFELY</small>&#x2026;. (Cf. Gen. 33:18) <small>NOW JACOB CAME SAFELY</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ergo (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU; AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS</small>. &#x003C; The plural, <small>WAYS</small>, signifies &#x003E; two times. Thus the Holy One caused the sun to go down ahead of time when he wanted to go forth and when he wanted to speak with him. (Gen. 28:12:) <small>AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA</small>. What is written there (in vs. 13)? <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small> (on Jacob&#x2019;s ladder)&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn803">42</xref></sup> Also, when he came &#x003C; back &#x003E;, he made the sun rise for him ahead of time (according to Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE FOR HIM</small>. Now did the sun rise, not over the whole world, but over Jacob alone? &#x003C; It &#x003E; merely &#x003C; rose &#x003E; in order to heal him (from his lameness).<sup><xref rid="fn804">43</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Mal. 3:20 [4:2]): <small>BUT FOR YOU WHO FEAR MY NAME A SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS SHALL ARISE &#x003C; WITH HEALING IN ITS WINGS &#x003E;</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: What is the meaning of (Gen. 32:32 [31]): <small>THE SUN ROSE FOR HIM</small>? That he made the sun rise for him [three hours] ahead of time just as it had set for him ahead of time. Jacob said: On five things did the Holy One make agreements with me (in Gen. 28:20-21) and carry them out. As for me, should I not on my part carry out what I said, now that I have returned &#x003C; safely unto my father&#x2019;s house &#x003E; (in accordance with Gen. 28:21)? Immediately (according to Gen. 33:20), <small>HE ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE AND CALLED IT EL, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>. When Israel endured (as a people), the Holy One said to Moses: Moses, the five things that I did with Jacob I have done for his children.</p>
<ol>
<li>(Gen. 28:20:) <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>. (Cf. Exod. 13:21:) <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>PROTECTS ME</small>. Thus I protected them from Pharaoh and his associates, and I overthrew Pharaoh and his whole army. So also with Amalek (in Exod. 17:13): <small>AND JOSHUA OVERTHREW AMALEK AND HIS PEOPLE</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND GIVES ME FOOD TO EAT</small>. (Cf. Exod. 16:4:) <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:20, cont.:) <small>AND CLOTHING TO PUT ON</small>. (Cf. Deut. 8:4:) <small>YOUR CLOTHING DID NOT WEAR OUT ON YOU</small>.</li>
<li>(Gen. 28:21:) <small>AND IF I RETURN SAFELY</small>. (Cf. Exod. 18:23:) <small>ALL THIS PEOPLE SHALL ALSO COME TO ITS PLACE SAFELY</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then afterwards &#x003C; Jacob &#x003E; took his kingdom (i.e., the kingdom of the Holy One) upon himself, as stated (in Gen. 33:20): <small>HE ERECTED AN ALTAR THERE &#x003C; AND CALLED IT EL, THE GOD OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. So also did &#x003C; the people &#x003E; take his kingdom upon themselves. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 20:2): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. What did they say &#x003C; in reply &#x003E; ? All of them answered with one accord; <small>AND</small> (according to Exod. 24:7) <small>THEY SAID: ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL DO AND OBEY</small>. Ergo (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>.</p>
<title>8.11 Genesis 33:18ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>. Did he lack something? Indeed, when they said to him (in Gen. 32:7 [6]): <small>MOREOVER HE (Esau) IS COMING TO MEET YOU, AND THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED MEN WITH HIM</small>; he arose and prepared a gift.<sup><xref rid="fn805">44</xref></sup> (According to Gen. 32:15-16 [14-15]) he began by giving she-goats because they were tender. Afterwards &#x003C; according to the text, there were &#x003E; he-goats, ewes, rams, &#x003C; and &#x003E; <small>THIRTY MILCH CAMELS WITH THEIR COLTS</small>. [R. Levi said: If I went around among all the tents of Kedar (i.e., of the Ishmaelites) you would not have found <small>THIRTY MILCH CAMELS WITH THEIR COLTS</small>.] Look at Jacob&#x2019;s wealth&#x0021; In addition (according to Gen. 32:16 [15]) he gave <small>FORTY COWS AND TEN BULLS</small>. R. Isaac said: &#x003C; These did &#x003E; not include precious stones and pearls. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:14 [13]): <small>THEN HE TOOK FROM WHAT WAS IN HAND</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; things taken up in the hand. These would be precious stones and pearls. R. Judah b. R. Shallum said: All twelve months that he spent with him, he would so honor him (with gifts) on each day. In this regard Jacob said (in Deut. 16:19): <small>FOR A GIFT BLINDS THE EYES OF THE (PRUDENT) [WISE]</small>. &#x003C; He reasoned &#x003E; a fortiori, how much the more &#x003C; would a gift blind &#x003E; the wicked&#x0021; Just consider this: I am honoring him so that he will not touch me.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: He had thought and said: Possessions from outside the land have no blessing in them. He was therefore squandering them. R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said: A certain old man said to me: &#x003C; I &#x003E; am telling you &#x003C; something in &#x003E; the form of midrash; so, whenever you expound it, tell it in my name.<sup><xref rid="fn806">45</xref></sup> Esau is going to restore to Jacob all that he received from Jacob. It is so stated (in Ps. 72:10): <small>THE KINGS OF TARSHISH AND OF THE ISLES SHALL RETURN TRIBUTE</small>. &#x201C;Shall bring tribute&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>SHALL RETURN TRIBUTE</small>. I told him: This is a good saying: I will expound it in your name. He said to him: Surely if, what he had knowingly given him and had pressed upon him, that which he did not wish to receive, even as stated (in Gen. 33:9): <small>THEN ESAU SAID: I HAVE ENOUGH</small>&#x2014;&#x003C; Surely if &#x003E; he would return &#x003C; that &#x003E;, then how much the more would they (the children of Esau) do so in the case of things which they had taken from Israel by force. In that hour I thanked him.</p>
<p>Esau said: How long will I trouble my brother? He arose and went away, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB &#x003E;</small>. What did Jacob do? When his children and his flocks had crossed over into the land of Israel, he arose and sold all that he had brought with him from outside of the land. Then he made it into piles of gold. He said to Esau: You have a share with me in the cave of Machpelah. Now what do you want, to receive these piles of gold or to share &#x003C; the cave &#x003E; with me? Esau began by saying: What do I want with &#x003C; a share &#x003E; of this cave? This gold is what I want. Now where is it shown that Jacob sold all that he had brought from outside of the land and that Esau took it? Where Joseph said so (in Gen. 50:5): <small>MY FATHER HAD ME SWEAR, SAYING: SEE, I AM DYING. IN MY GRAVE WHICH I DUG &#x003C; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, THERE YOU SHALL BURY ME &#x003E;</small>. R. Huna b. R. Abbin the Priest said: When Jacob wanted to come to the land of Israel, what is written (in Gen. 31:18)? <small>AND HE DROVE ALL HIS LIVESTOCK &#x003C; AND ALL HIS GOODS THAT HE HAD ACQUIRED &#x2026; IN PADDAN-ARAM &#x003E;</small>. Now, when he wanted to go down into Egypt, what is written (in Gen. 46:6)? <small>AND THEY TOOK ALONG THEIR LIVESTOCK AND ALL THEIR GOODS, WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>. Now, in regard to what he had brought from the land of Aram-Naharaim, where was that? You simply learn from here that Jacob had sold it and given it to Esau.<sup><xref rid="fn807">46</xref></sup> Then would you say that something was lacking? The Holy One simply filled his loss and restored everything to him immediately, as stated (in Gen. 33:18:) <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>.</p>
<title>8.12 Genesis 34: 1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH &#x003C; WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB &#x003E; WENT OUT</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is is legitimate for a woman to go out with her jewelry on the Sabbath into a public place?<sup><xref rid="fn808">47</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (according to <italic>Shab</italic>. 6:1): <small>A WOMAN SHALL NOT GO OUT</small> into a public place on the Sabbath with her jewelry, <small>NOR WITH A HAIR NET &#x2026; NOR WITH A GOLDEN TIARA, NOR WITH A <italic>CATELLA</italic></small><sup><xref rid="fn809">48</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a type of jewelry&#x007D; &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>NOR WITH A NEEDLE HAVING NO EYE. BUT, IF SHE SHOULD GO OUT, SHE IS NOT LIABLE FOR [A SIN OFFERING]</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; when she goes out &#x003C; of her rooms &#x003E; with them &#x003C; but remains &#x003E; within the house. Let her not, however, go out into a public place with a single piece of jewelry. Now, our masters say: Even on a weekday she must not go out into a public place. Why? Because people will stare at her. Thus the Holy One gave jewelry to a woman only for her to adorn herself with them inside of the house; for one does not give an opening<sup><xref rid="fn810">49</xref></sup> to the trustworthy person, let alone to the thief. And so Job has said (in Job 31:1): <small>I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH MY EYES. HOW THEN SHALL I GAZE ON A MAIDEN</small>? Come and see Job&#x2019;s righteousness. If in the case of a maiden, at whom any man has a right to look, perhaps to marry her or perhaps to marry her to his son or to one of his kin, Job did not look at her, how much the less in the case of someone&#x2019;s wife, at whom he has no right to look. It is therefore written (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING&#x2019;S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>. So, if she acts to conceal herself and is worthy, (ibid., cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>. R. Levi said: She was worthy to raise up priests to put on the high priestly garments. Now there is no <small>BROCADE</small> except priestly garments. Thus it is stated (regarding Aaron&#x2019;s vestments in Exod. 28:13): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE GOLD BROCADE</small>. There is already an allusion in the Torah about this thing, that a woman should not go about a lot in a marketplace. Where? Where it is so written (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM, AND GOD SAID TO THEM: &#x003C; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY, FILL THE EARTH &#x003E; AND SUBDUE HER. [AND SUBDUE HER</small> is written &#x003C; here &#x003E;].<sup><xref rid="fn811">50</xref></sup> The man subdues the woman, and the woman does not subdue the man. But, if she walks about a lot and goes out into the marketplace, she finally comes to a state of corruption, to a state of harlotry. And so you find in the case of Jacob&#x2019;s daughter Dinah. All the time that she was sitting at home, she was not corrupted by transgression; but, as soon as she went out into the marketplace, she caused herself to come to the point of corruption.</p>
<title>8.13 Genesis 34:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 11:12): <small>ONE WHO DESPISES HIS NEIGHBOR IS LACKING IN SENSE</small>. Whoever scorns his neighbor is called <small>LACKING IN SENSE</small>. But, if that same person who was despised was a person of knowledge and understanding, he would put his hand over his mouth and be silent. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>BUT A PERSON OF UNDERSTANDING WILL KEEP SILENT</small>. (Prov. 11:12:) <small>ONE WHO DESPISES HIS NEIGHBOR IS LACKING IN SENSE</small>. This is Hamor,<sup><xref rid="fn812">51</xref></sup> the father of Shechem, who said (in Gen. 34:8): <small>THE SOUL OF MY SON, SHECHEM, LONGS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER</small>. (Prov. 11:12, cont.:) <small>BUT A PERSON OF UNDERSTANDING WILL KEEP SILENT</small>. This is Jacob of whom it is stated (in Gen. 34:5): <small>SO JACOB KEPT SILENCE UNTIL THEY CAME</small>. For what reason? On account of this corruption (in Gen. 34:1-2): <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH, &#x003C; WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB &#x003E; WENT OUT&#x2026;. &#x003C; THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND, SAW HER. SO HE TOOK HER, LAY WITH HER, AND VIOLATED HER &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>8.14 Genesis 34:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>.] This text is related (to Ezek. 16:44): <small>BEHOLD, EVERYONE WHO USES PROVERBS WILL USE A PROVERB ABOUT YOU AND SAY: LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn813">52</xref></sup> Our master asked R. Hiyya: In what sense do you say: <small>LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER</small>? He said to him: Just as the altar, so are its priests. Rabbi (in his day) had taken a lot of pains with &#x003C; this text &#x003E;. He said to him: Tell &#x003C; me &#x003E; the truth; in what sense do you say it? He said to him: Just as the prince, so is the generation.<sup><xref rid="fn814">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ezek. 16:44): <small>LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER</small>. This refers to Dinah. What is written of Leah (in Gen. 30:16)? <small>LEAH WENT OUT TO MEET HIM</small>. So also (in Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW &#x003C; LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER &#x003E; DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>.</p>
<title>8.15 Genesis 34:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW &#x003C; LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER &#x003E; DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. This text is related (to II Kings 14:9): <small>THE THISTLE THAT WAS IN LEBANON</small>. This thistle was Shechem&#x2019;s father, Hamor.<sup><xref rid="fn815">54</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SENT TO THE CEDAR THAT WAS IN LEBANON</small>. This is Jacob, as stated (in Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM, LIKE A CEDAR IN LEBANON SHALL HE GROW</small>. (II Kings 14:9, cont.:) <small>GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER TO MY SON FOR A WIFE</small>. Thus it says (in Gen. 34:8): <small>PLEASE GIVE HER TO HIM FOR A WIFE</small>. (II Kings 14:9, cont.:) <small>BUT A WILD BEAST PASSED BY</small>. These are the tribes, who have been compared to wild beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn816">55</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 49:9): <small>JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>, (in vs. 27:) <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>, (in vs. 21:) <small>NAPHTHALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE</small>, (and in vs. 14:) <small>ISSACHAR IS A STRONG-BONED ASS</small>. (II Kings 14:9, cont.:) <small>AND TRAMPLED DOWN THE THISTLE</small>. This is Hamor and his son Shechem, whom &#x003C; the tribes &#x003E; killed with the edge of the sword because of Dinah, as stated (in Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. In every place the female child is accompanied by males, but here she is accompanied by her mother. Thus, the corruption had begun with her mother.</p>
<title>8.16 Genesis 34: 1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW &#x003C; LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER &#x003E; DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. But &#x003C; had she gone out &#x003E; from sin? After all, Jacob had said (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>I AM UNWORTHY OF ALL THE KINDNESSES</small>. R. Aha said: &#x003C; The Holy One said &#x003E;: I have nourished your ancestors from their &#x003C; good &#x003E; deeds, but you say: <small>I AM UNWORTHY</small>&#x0021; The Holy One said to him: Jacob, &#x003C; it is &#x003E; through your righteousness &#x003C; that &#x003E; I have done all these miracles of which you say that you are unworthy. But look, she is going out; yet your merit shall remain for you. (Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW &#x003C; LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER &#x003E; DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>.</p>
<title>8.17 Genesis 34:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>[(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW &#x003C; LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER &#x003E; DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY COUNSEL AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT MY REBUKE</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Eve. When the Holy One wanted to create her,<sup><xref rid="fn817">56</xref></sup> the Holy One said: If I create her from Adam&#x2019;s head, her spirit will be haughtily above her; &#x003C; if &#x003E; from his eyes, &#x003C; she will be &#x003E; flirtatious; &#x003C; if &#x003E; from his mouth, she will be loquacious; &#x003C; if &#x003E; from his hands, she will be a thief; &#x003C; if &#x003E; from his feet, she will be a gadabout. The Holy One said: All this counsel I took before I created her, and I did not depart from it. I said: If I create her from his head, her spirit will be haughtily above her; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, as stated (in Is. 3:16): <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD SAID: BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION ARE HAUGHTY</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; If &#x003E; from his eyes; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, (ibid., cont.:) <small>&#x003C; HER &#x003E; EYES ARE ROVING ABOUT</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; from &#x003C; the &#x003E; ears; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, (in Gen. 18:10:) <small>SARAH WAS LISTENING &#x003C; AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; from his mouth; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, (in Numb. 12:1:) <small>THEN MIRIAM &#x2026; SPOKE &#x003C; AGAINST MOSES &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; from his hands; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, (in Gen. 31:19) <small>RACHEL STOLE</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; from his feet, she will be going in and out; &#x003C; yet &#x003E;, (in Gen. 34:1) <small>DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY COUNSEL</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.18 Genesis 34:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH&#x2026; WENT OUT</small>. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: The male is always attributed to the wife, and the female, to the husband.<sup><xref rid="fn818">57</xref></sup> Then why is this &#x003C; daughter &#x003E; attributed to her mother? Because her pregnancy was originally male. However, when Leah had borne six &#x003C; sons &#x003E;, Billah, two, and Zilpah, two, for a total of ten; then she prayed on behalf of &#x003C; the barren &#x003E; Rachel, and &#x003C; the child &#x003E; in her womb became female.<sup><xref rid="fn819">58</xref></sup> For that reason, she was attributed to her mother. (Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH &#x2026; WENT OUT</small>.</p>
<title>8.19 Genesis 34:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Gen. 34:1:) <small>&#x003C; NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH, WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB, WENT OUT &#x003E; TO SEE THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LAND. TO SEE &#x003C; implies &#x003E; TO BE SEEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn820">59</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To one who was walking in the marketplace with a piece &#x003C; of meat &#x003E; in his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn821">60</xref></sup> A dog, having seen it, went after it, and snatched it from him. Thus did Dinah go out <small>TO SEE</small> (and <small>TO BE SEEN</small>) when Shechem saw her and seized her.<sup><xref rid="fn822">61</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Gen. 34:1): <small>TO SEE THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LAND</small>. When the children of Jacob came into the land of Israel, they began to exhibit their strength, their wealth, and their beauty. They exhibited their strength (according to Gen. 34:25): <small>THAT TWO OF JACOB&#x2019;S SONS, &#x003C; SIMEON AND LEVI, BROTHERS OF DINAH &#x003E;, [EACH TOOK HIS SWORD &#x2026; AND KILLED EVERY MALE]</small>. They exhibited their wealth (according to Gen. 33:17): <small>BUT JACOB JOURNEYED TO SUCCOTH, BUILT A HOUSE FOR HIMSELF, AND MADE STALLS (<italic>sukkot</italic>) FOR HIS CATTLE</small>. He began opening &#x003C; cattle &#x003E; bazaars.<sup><xref rid="fn823">62</xref></sup> And where is it shown concerning their beauty? (In Gen. 34:1:) <small>NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH, WHOM SHE HAD BORNE TO JACOB, WENT OUT TO SEE AND TO BE SEEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn824">63</xref></sup> (Gen. 34:2:) <small>THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND, SAW HER</small>. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; the wicked &#x003C; who &#x003E; &#x201C;see.&#x201D; (Thus in Esth. 3:5:) <small>WHEN HAMAN SAW</small>. (Similarly in Gen. 28:6:) <small>WHEN ESAU SAW</small>. (So also here, in Gen. 34:2:) <small>THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR &#x2026; SAW</small>. David said (in Ps. 69:24:) <small>LET THEIR EYES BE DARKENED SO THAT THEY DO NOT SEE</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 34:2, cont.:) <small>SO HE TOOK HER, LAY WITH HER, AND VIOLATED HER</small>. Because of what sin did the uncircumcised one come upon her? It is written (in Job 6:14) <small>TO ONE WHO IS DESPONDENT LOYALTY IS DUE FROM HIS NEIGHBOR EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD ABANDON THE FEAR OF THE ALMIGHTY</small>. However, when our father Jacob came along with the tribes, Dinah was with him &#x003C; as well &#x003E;. As soon as the messengers came and said to him (according to Gen. 32:7 [6]): <small>WE CAME UNTO YOUR BROTHER ESAU</small>, Jacob took Dinah and put her in a chest so that Esau would not see her and take her for a wife.<sup><xref rid="fn825">64</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: You have withheld her from him. By your life, she is ready for an uncircumcised man, i.e., the one about whom it is written (in Job 6:14): <small>TO ONE WHO IS DESPONDENT LOYALTY IS DUE FROM HIS NEIGHBOR</small>. If she had been married to Esau, perhaps she would have converted him. When Job took her, did she not convert him?<sup><xref rid="fn826">65</xref></sup> He therefore withheld her. See, &#x003C; now &#x003E; the son of a cursed (rt.: &#x2019;<italic>RH</italic>) one has come across her. Ergo (in Gen. 34:2): <small>THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR &#x2026; SAW (rt.: <italic>R&#x2019;H</italic>) HER</small>.</p>
<title>8.20 Genesis 34:1ff., Part IX</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 33:18)? <small>NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE</small>. &#x003C; When &#x003E; he had come from Paddan-Aram under conditions that the Holy One had set with him, he did not lessen him in any respect. What did Jacob do? He began opening bazaars.<sup><xref rid="fn827">66</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Have you forgotten what you vowed to me? And did you not say this (in Gen. 28:20): <small>IF GOD IS WITH ME</small>, so that I do not commit idolatry, (ibid., cont.:) <small>AND PROTECTS ME</small>, from bloodshed, (ibid., cont.:) <small>ON THE WAY</small>, from unchastity, as stated (in Prov. 30:20): <small>SUCH IS THE WAY OF AN ADULTERESS: SHE EATS, WIPES HER MOUTH, AND SAYS: I HAVE DONE NO WRONG</small>. The Holy One did protect him, for it so states (in Gen. 28:15): <small>AND I WILL PROTECT YOU WHEREVER YOU GO</small>. Jacob said (in Gen. 28:22): <small>[AND] OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>. As soon as he came to the land of Israel, he forgot this vow. The Holy One said: By your life, through the very things which you said you would observe, through them you shall come to grief. Where is it shown in regard to idolatry? Where it is stated (in Gen. 35:4): <small>THEN THEY GAVE UNTO JACOB ALL THE ALIEN GODS THAT THEY HAD</small>&#x2026;. Where is it shown in regard to bloodshed? Where it is stated (in Gen. 34:25): <small>THAT TWO OF JACOB&#x2019;S SONS, SIMEON AND LEVI, BROTHERS OF DINAH, EACH TOOK HIS SWORD &#x2026; [AND KILLED EVERY MALE]</small>. Where is it shown in regard to unchastity? From Dinah, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 34:2-3): <small>THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND, SAW HER. &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND HIS SOUL CLUNG TO JACOB&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH</small>. R. Abbahu said: We have learned things from putrid secretion (i.e., mere mortals):<sup><xref rid="fn828">67</xref></sup> (Gen. 41:44:) <small>PHARAOH SAID TO JOSEPH: I AM PHARAOH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn829">68</xref></sup> I have said that you shall be king. The Holy One said to Israel concerning each and every commandment which they do: <small>I AM THE LORD</small> (e.g., in Lev. 19:3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, etc.). I am the one who is going to repay each and everyone with his reward. Now, just as in the case of flesh and blood, when it said: <small>I AM PHARAOH</small>, it raised him to great dignity; so much the more so with me when I say something. And just as you said (in Gen. 41:40): <small>ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THE THRONE SHALL I BE GREATER THAN YOU</small>, &#x003C; so &#x003E; has the Holy One said to Israel (in Deut. 28:13): <small>AND YOU ONLY SHALL BE AT THE TOP</small>. Just as an &#x201C;only&#x201D; from flesh and blood (i.e., from Pharaoh) magnified Joseph, so much the more so in the case of an &#x201C;only&#x201D; from the Holy One.</p>
<p>It is written of Israel (in Deut. 7:7): <small>THE LORD HAS DELIGHTED IN YOU AND CHOSEN YOU</small>. It is also written (in Gen. 34:3): <small>AND HE (Shechem) LOVED THE MAIDEN (Dinah)</small>. Now you would not know what that love was; [however, from the fact that he set his soul upon her, you do know what love was]. How much the more so in the case of the Holy One, when he said to Israel (in Mal. 1:2): <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU</small>&#x0021; (According to Deut. 7:7:) <small>THE LORD HAS DELIGHTED IN YOU</small>; you do not know how. We do, however, learn from Shechem, as stated (in Gen. 34:8): <small>THE SOUL OF MY SON, SHECHEM, LONGS FOR YOUR DAUGHTER</small>. R. Abbahu said: We have learned from putrid secretion (i.e., mere mortals). It is written about Shechem (in Gen. 34:3): <small>AND HIS SOUL CLUNG TO JACOB&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH</small>; and it is written about Israel (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.</p>
<title>8.21 Genesis 35:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 35:1:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB: ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>. Let our master instruct us: When one prays,<sup><xref rid="fn830">69</xref></sup> where should he direct his heart? Thus have our masters taught: One who prays should (according to <italic>Ber</italic>. 4:5-6) <small>DIRECT HIS HEART TOWARD THE HOUSE OF THE HOLY OF HOLIES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn831">70</xref></sup> R. Eliezer ben Jacob says: One who prays outside of the land [is to direct his heart towards the land of Israel. One who prays in the land of Israel is to direct his heart toward Jerusalem. One who prays in Jerusalem is to direct his heart toward the Sanctuary. When one prays in the Sanctuary], he is to direct his heart to the House of the Holy of Holies. R. Abbin the Levite said: It is written (in Cant. 4:4): <small>LIKE THE TOWER OF DAVID (i.e., the Temple), YOUR NECK IS BUILT FOR <italic>TLPYWT</italic> (TURRETS)</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR <italic>TLPYWT</italic></small>? That all mouths <italic>PYWT</italic> pray through it.<sup><xref rid="fn832">71</xref></sup> [R. Judah the Levite said: It is written (in I Kings 6:17): <small>THAT IS THE TEMPLE <italic>LPNY</italic></small>. What is the meaning of <italic>LPNY</italic>? That all the faces (<italic>PNYM</italic>) turn to<sup><xref rid="fn833">72</xref></sup> it.] The Holy One said: Everyone is going to and yearning for my house. Are you not going there? (Gen. 35:1) <small>ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn834">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Jose said: He immediately began to take [counsel with] the tribes who would go up with him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 35:3): <small>LET <italic>US</italic> ARISE AND GO UP</small>. They said to him: Where to? He said to them: To the place where my Creator told me (in vs. 1): <small>ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>&#x2026;. R. Aha said: Jerusalem is only built by virtue of the tribes. It is so stated (in Ps. 122:3): <small>JERUSALEM IS BUILT UP AS A CITY WHICH HAS BEEN KNIT TOGETHER</small>. What is written after this (in vs. 4)? <small>FOR THERE HAVE THE TRIBES GONE UP</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.22 Genesis 35:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>It is written (in Ps. 50:14): <small>SACRIFICE A THANK OFFERING TO GOD</small>. When Jacob left his father&#x2019;s house, he left with nothing but his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>WITH ONLY MY STAFF I CROSSED THIS JORDAN</small>. Immediately Jacob had made a vow before the Holy One, as stated (in Gen. 28:20): <small>THEN JACOB VOWED A VOW</small>. What is written at the end of the passage (in vs. 22)? <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME</small>. But, when he enriched him, as stated (in Gen. 30:43): <small>SO THE MAN (Jacob) BECAME VERY VERY PROSPEROUS</small>, he forgot his vow. Immediately he provoked Laban against him, as stated (in Gen. 31:23): <small>SO HE (Laban) TOOK HIS RELATIVES WITH HIM &#x003C; AND PURSUED HIM (Jacob) SEVEN DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY &#x003E;</small>. When he had escaped from Laban, Esau was incited against him. Immediately the angel appeared to him. He said to him: Are you not aware of all this trouble? Why has all the trouble come over you? Because you have been late with your vow. Jacob said to him (in Gen. 32:30 [29]) &#x007B;<small>WHAT IS</small>&#x007D; <small>[PLEASE TELL] YOUR NAME</small>. He said to him (ibid.): <small>WHY IS IT THAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR MY NAME</small>? Sometimes the angel is made into a spirit, as stated (in Ps. 104:4): <small>HE HAS MADE HIS ANGELS SPIRITS</small>. Sometimes he is made a into lightning bolt, as stated (in Job 38:35): <small>CAN YOU SEND FORTH LIGHTNINGS SO THAT THEY GO</small>? But as for the miracles (of transformation), he (God) acts himself. And so the angel said to Manoah (in Jud. 13:18): <small>YOU ARE NOT TO ASK MY NAME</small>. (Gen. 32:30 [29]:) <small>WHY IS IT THAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR MY NAME</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn835">74</xref></sup> Immediately the angel blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 32:30 [29]): <small>AND HE BLESSED HIM THERE</small>. (Hos. 12:5 [4]:) <small>SO HE STROVE WITH AN ANGEL AND PREVAILED</small>. What did he say to him? Go, fulfill your vow. (Eccl. 5:4 [5]:) <small>IT IS BETTER NOT TO VOW &#x003C; THAN TO VOW AND NOT FULFILL</small> &#x003E;. What did Simeon and Levi do immediately? <small>TWO OF JACOB&#x2019;S SONS, [SIMEON AND LEVI, BROTHERS OF DINAH, EACH TOOK HIS SWORD] &#x2026; &#x003C; AND KILLED EVERY MALE &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; Jacob &#x003E; immediately fell on his face and did not get up until &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; gave him permission (in Gen. 35:1): <small>ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>. So also with Joshua (according to Josh. 7:6 &#x0026; 10): <small>[AND HE FELL ON HIS FACE] &#x003C; .. . &#x003E; THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JOSHUA: ARISE, GO. WHY IS IT THAT YOU FALL UPON YOUR FACE</small>? So also with David (according to I Chron. 21:16): <small>SO DAVID AND THE ELDERS, COVERED IN SACKCLOTH, FELL UPON THEIR FACES</small>. Then what was said to him (in II Sam. 24:18)? <small>GO UP, ERECT AN ALTAR TO THE LORD ON THE THRESHING FLOOR OF ARAUNAH</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 35:1): <small>ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>. He immediately journeyed with his whole house; and the Holy One put his fear upon all about him, as stated (in Gen. 35:5): <small>AND, AS THEY JOURNEYED, A TERROR FROM GOD CAME &#x003C; UPON THE CITIES THAT WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM &#x003E;</small>. It is also stated (in Deut. 28:10): <small>AND ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH SHALL SEE THAT THE NAME OF THE LORD IS PROCLAIMED OVER YOU, AND THEY SHALL BE AFRAID OF YOU</small>.</p>
<title>8.23 Genesis 35:9ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Eccl. 7:2): <small>IT IS BETTER TO GO UNTO A HOUSE OF MOURNING &#x003C; THAN UNTO A HOUSE OF FEASTING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Simeon bar Abba said: There are two ways to be charitable, to be charitable with a bride and with the dead. If both of these &#x003C; opportunities &#x003E; should present themselves to you, you would not know which of them to seize first. Solomon came and explained (in Eccl. 7:2): <small>IT IS BETTER TO GO INTO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING &#x003C; THAN UNTO A HOUSE OF FEASTING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. We have found that, when people have gone to the house of feasting, their names were not specified; but, when people have gone to the house of mourning, they have been excluded from Gehinnom, their names have been specified, and they have prophesied through the Holy Spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn836">75</xref></sup> So who were those who entered the house of feasting? It is written (in Gen. 21:8): <small>SO THE CHILD (Isaac) GREW AND WAS WEANED, AND ABRAHAM MADE A GREAT FEAST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GREAT</small>? It teaches that Shem, Eber, and Abimelech were there; but their names were not specified.<sup><xref rid="fn837">76</xref></sup> However, the names of those who went to the house of mourning &#x007B;Job and his friends&#x007D; were excluded from Gehinnom and the Holy Spirit rested upon them, i.e., upon Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. And the Holy Spirit rested upon them, in that it is stated (in Job 4:1): <small>THEN ANSWERED ELIPHAZ THE TEMANITE</small>. Now he would only have answered in the language of prophecy. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:19): <small>MOSES SPOKE, AND GOD ANSWERED HIM IN THUNDER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn838">77</xref></sup> Ergo: <small>IT IS BETTER TO GO INTO THE HOUSE OF MOURNING &#x003C; THAN INTO A HOUSE OF FEASTING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And who was the first to show his face [as a mourner]. See, the Holy One says &#x003C; when &#x003E;. When? When Deborah died, as stated (in Gen. 35:8): <small>THEN &#x003C; REBEKAH&#x2019;S NURSE &#x003E; DEBORAH DIED &#x003C; AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE OAK BELOW BETHEL; AND ITS NAME WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK &#x003E;</small>.

<p>[(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>&#x2026;.] <small>&#x003C; AND BLESSED HIM &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Job 4:12-13): <small>NOW A WORD WAS SECRETLY BROUGHT UNTO ME, AND MY EAR RECEIVED A WHISPER OF IT, IN THOUGHTS FROM NIGHT VISIONS, WHEN DEEP SLEEP FALLS UPON PEOPLE. NOW A WORD WAS SECRETLY BROUGHT UNTO ME</small>. [When the Holy One reveals himself unto the wicked, he reveals himself unto them by stealth at night; but] when he reveals himself unto the righteous, he reveals himself unto them in public.<sup><xref rid="fn840">79</xref></sup> &#x007B;But when he&#x007D; [R. Issachar said: When the Holy One] reveals himself unto the wicked, he reveals himself in colloquial speech, in unclean speech,<sup><xref rid="fn841">80</xref></sup> in semi-utterance. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 23:4): <small>THEN GOD ENCOUNTERED BALAAM. ENCOUNTERED</small> &#x003C; denotes &#x003E; nothing but unclean speech. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 23:11 [10]): <small>WHO IS UNCLEAN BECAUSE OF WHAT HE ENCOUNTERS AT NIGHT</small> (i.e., a nocturnal emission). But when he reveals himself to the righteous, he reveals himself in clean speech. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES &#x003C; AND SPOKE UNTO HIM FROM THE TENT OF MEETING &#x003E;</small>. It was therefore stated (in Job 4:12): <small>NOW A WORD WAS SECRETLY BROUGHT UNTO ME (Eliphaz)</small>. When the Holy One reveals himself to the wicked, [he reveals himself] in the night because their deeds are dark like the night. For that reason he reveals himself to them in the night. Thus it is stated (concerning Laban in Gen. 31:24): <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO LABAN &#x003C; THE ARAMAEAN &#x003E; IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>. But when he comes to the righteous, what is written (in Gen. 35:9)? <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN, &#x003C; WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDANARAM &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn842">81</xref></sup></p>

This text is related (to Deut. 28:6): <small>BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN YOUR COMING; &#x003C; AND BLESSED SHALL YOU BE IN YOUR GOING AWAY &#x003E;</small>. When Jacob went away from his father&#x2019;s house, he went away with a blessing, as stated (in Gen. 28:3): <small>MAY GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU</small>. Also, when he came from Paddan-Aram, he came with a blessing, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND BLESSED HIM</small>. How did he bless him? R. Levi said: He blessed him with a benediction for mourners. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 35:8)? <small>THEN &#x003C; REBEKAH&#x2019;S NURSE &#x003E; DEBORAH DIED &#x003C; AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE OAK BELOW BETHEL; AND ITS NAME WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK &#x003E;</small>. R.

<p>[(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>.] This text is related (to Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU</small>. &#x003C; The passage &#x003E; speaks about Jacob. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>[AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS. UPON] two WAYS</small>. When he went away from his father&#x2019;s house, the Holy One revealed himself to him. What is written (in Gen. 28:13)? <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM AND SAID</small>. Also, when he returned, what is written (in 35:9)? <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>. What is the meaning of AGAIN? R. Judah said: He said to him: Once <small>AGAIN</small> I am revealing myself to you. The Holy One revealed himself to him five times, which corresponds to the five blessings with which his father had blessed him; and they are as follows (according to Gen. 28:3f): <small>(1) &#x003C; MAY &#x003E; GOD ALMIGHTY &#x003C; BLESS YOU, (2) MAKE YOU FRUITFUL, AND (3) MULTIPLY YOU, (4) SO THAT YOU MAY BECOME A CONGREGATION OF PEOPLES &#x003E;; (5) AND MAY HE GRANT YOU THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</small>&#x2026;. Here are five blessings. And &#x003C; God &#x003E; revealed himself to him:</p>
<ol>
<li>&#x003C; Once &#x003E; When he went away from his father&#x2019;s house, as stated (in Gen. 28:13): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM</small>.</li>
<li>Once with Laban (in Gen. 31:3): <small>&#x003C; THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JACOB &#x003E; : RETURN UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR ANCESTORS</small>.</li>
<li>Once (in Gen. 35:1): <small>&#x003C; THEN GOD SAID UNTO JACOB &#x003E;: ARISE, GO UP TO BETHEL</small>.</li>
<li>Once (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>.</li>
<li>And once (in Gen. 46:2,4): <small>THEN GOD SPOKE TO ISRAEL AND SAID&#x2026;. I MYSELF WILL GO DOWN WITH YOU</small>&#x2026;.</li>

<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AGAIN</small>?

<p>(Gen. 35:9:) <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>. What is written next (in vs. 11)? <small>AND GOD SAID TO HIM: I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</small>. You are an omen for your children. When I came to you, I came laden with blessings. So, when I come to your children, I will come laden with blessings, as stated (in Exod. 20:21 [24]): <small>IN EVERY PLACE WHERE I CAUSE MY NAME TO BE MENTIONED, I WILL COME UNTO YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN, &#x003C; WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDANARAM, AND BLESSED HIM &#x003E;</small>. And not to Jacob only &#x003C; did he do so &#x003E;, but also to our father Abraham. What is written (about Abraham in Gen. 18:1)? <small>THEN THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM &#x2026; &#x003C; AS HE SAT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn848">87</xref></sup> The Holy One was standing, as it were, while he was sitting. He wanted to stand. The Holy One said to him: Sit down&#x0021; By your life, you are an omen for your children. Just as you sit while I stand; &#x007B;according to what is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>&#x007D; so also shall your children sit in synagogues and academies while I stand, as it were, according to what is stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION</small>. Here also (at Paddan-Aram in Gen. 35:9) the Holy One said to Jacob: You are an omen to your children. Just as in your case, when I came to you, I came laden with blessings; &#x003C; so &#x003E; also in the case of your children, when I reveal myself to them, I will be laden with blessings. As soon as the Tabernacle had been built, what is written (in Numb. 7:1, 4): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE, &#x003C; HAD ANOINTED IT AND SANCTIFIED IT&#x2026;THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES &#x003E;</small>. Now, when work on it was finished, the Holy One said: I have made an agreement with them. When I reveal myself to them, I will be laden with blessings. What did the Holy One do? He blessed them and later revealed himself to them. What is written about the priestly blessing (in Numb. 6:24-26)? <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU; THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU; THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>. Then, later (in Numb. 7:1, 4): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE &#x2026; &#x003C; THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES &#x003E;</small>.</p>

<p>(Gen. 35:11:) <small>AND GOD SAID &#x003C; TO HIM &#x003E;: I AM GOD ALMIGHTY; BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY &#x2026; [AND KINGS SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS]</small>. The sages have said: On the basis of this text Abner drew an interpretation, as a result of which he enthroned Saul&#x2019;s son Ishbosheth,<sup><xref rid="fn849">88</xref></sup> namely, that Benjamin was going to produce two kings, since &#x003C; God &#x003E; had said to him: <small>AND KINGS</small> (in the plural) <small>SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn850">89</xref></sup> Now until then only Saul had arisen (as a king out of Benjamin). He therefore enthroned Saul&#x2019;s son Ishbosheth. And not only that, but also in &#x003C; the incident of &#x003E; the concubine at Gibeah (Jud. 19-21), &#x007B;&#x003C; the Israelites &#x003E; had readmitted him (i.e., Benjamin)&#x007D;. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: &#x003C; They did so &#x003E; on the basis of this text. When they had opposed him, they had said (in Jud. 21:1): <small>NONE OF US SHALL GIVE HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE TO BENJAMIN</small>. Thus they had banished him, but they later repented and accepted him. They said: If he were not more exalted than the heavens, the Holy One would not have said to our father Jacob (in Gen. 35:11), when he came &#x003C; back &#x003E; to the land from abroad: <small>AND KINGS SHALL COME OUT OF YOUR LOINS</small>. Thus on the basis of this text they readmitted him.</p>
<title>8.30 Genesis 35:9ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 35:11): <small>I AM GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. Aquila translated (in his Greek version): <small>I AM TRUSTWORTHY TO REPAY TO EVERYONE ACCORDING TO HIS WORKS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn851">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</small>. I was looking for you to <small>BE FRUITFUL, MULTIPLY</small>, and &#x003C; so &#x003E; raise up tribes.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>A NATION, EVEN AN ASSEMBLY OF NATIONS, SHALL COME FROM YOU</small>. He brought him the news that his children were going to become like the nations. Just as the nations number seventy, so also shall your children be seventy &#x003C; like &#x003E; a Sanhedrin: It is so stated (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER FOR ME SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>A NATION EVEN AN ASSEMBLY OF NATIONS</small>. He brought him news that his children were going to be sacrificing to Asherah like the &#x003C; non-Jewish &#x003E; nations. When? In the days of Elijah. What is written (in I Kings 18:30)? <small>AND HE REPAIRED (<italic>RP&#x2019;</italic>) THE BROKEN-DOWN ALTAR OF THE LORD</small>, in that he healed (<italic>RP&#x2019;</italic>) them and brought them into the way of goodness when he did all those miracles for them. When they saw him, what did they say (according to I Kings 18:39)? <small>THE LORD ALONE IS GOD; THE LORD ALONE IS GOD</small>&#x0021; In this world, because idolatry was common, they said: <small>THE LORD ALONE IS GOD; THE LORD ALONE IS GOD</small>; but in the world to come, when the Holy One reigns over us and over all Israel, they shall say (according to Zech. 14:9): <small>AND THE LORD SHALL BE A KING OVER ALL THE EARTH.

<title>Chapter 9 Genesis, Parashah IX: <italic>Wayyeshev</italic></title>
<title>9.1 Genesis 37:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 37:1:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT IN THE LAND WHERE HIS FATHER HAD SOJOURNED, &#x003C; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Deut. 33:27): <small>THE ETERNAL GOD IS A DWELLING PLACE</small>. R. Jeremiah said: We do not know (from the Hebrew text of Scripture) whether a <small>DWELLING PLACE</small> is <small>GOD</small> or whether <small>GOD</small> is a <small>DWELLING PLACE</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn852">1</xref></sup> When it says (in Ps. 90:1): <small>A PRAYER OF MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD: O LORD, YOU HAVE BEEN OUR DWELLING PLACE</small>, [here the Holy One is the dwelling place for his world and the world is not his place]. Although the Holy One created his world, he did not dwell in the land but a righteous one;<sup><xref rid="fn853">2</xref></sup> and by their merit &#x003C; such righteous &#x003E; ones sustain the world, as stated (in Deut. 33:27, cont.): <small>AND UNDERNEATH ARE THE ARMS OF THE WORLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn854">3</xref></sup> Come and see how, during all the time the wicked are in the world, the righteous never appear. And so you find that, during all the time Esau was in the land of Israel, Jacob was unable to appear. Esau passed on, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES, &#x003C; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB</small> &#x003E;. Immediately (one reads in Gen. 37:1): <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &#x003C; IN THE LAND &#x003E;</small>. Therefore, (according to Deut. 33:27, cont.): <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE ENEMY FROM BEFORE YOU</small>. At that time (according to vs. 28): <small>THUS ISRAEL DWELT SAFELY ALONE</small>.</p>
<title>9.2 Genesis 37:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 37:1:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &#x003C; IN THE LAND &#x003E;</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 57:13): <small>WHEN YOU CRY OUT, LET YOUR ASSEMBLED ONES SAVE YOU</small>. What are they? These are the angels who were placed to guard him when he went away to go to Aram-Naharaim, since the angels who minister in the land of Israel do not minister outside the land, nor do those who belong outside the land &#x003C; minister &#x003E; in the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn855">4</xref></sup> So (in Gen. 28:12) Jacob saw &#x003C; some &#x003E; ascending and others descending to go abroad with him. Then, when he came to return, the Holy One summoned those angels who had ministered to him in the land. He said to them: Here is Jacob returning. Come on and let us go out for a meeting<sup><xref rid="fn856">5</xref></sup> with him &#x007B;i.e., to the border&#x007D;. To what is the matter comparable? To a king whose son went away overseas to take a wife. After some time he came to return to his father&#x2019;s house. The king said to his court<sup><xref rid="fn857">6</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., to his army&#x007D;: Come and let us go out for a meeting with my son. So, when Jacob came to return to the land of his father, the Holy One called the ministering angels. He said to them: Come and let us go out for a meeting with Jacob. As soon as Jacob raised his eyes, he saw the angels, as stated (in Gen. 32:2 [1]): <small>SO JACOB WENT ON HIS WAY, AND THE ANGELS OF GOD MET HIM&#x2026;.</small> When Jacob saw them, where is it shown that they ministered to him in the land of Israel? Where it is stated (in vs. 3 [2]): <small>WHEN JACOB SAW THEM, HE SAID: THIS IS GOD&#x2019;S HOST</small>. It is therefore stated (in Is. 57:13): <small>WHEN YOU CRY OUT, LET YOUR ASSEMBLED ONES SAVE YOU</small>. These <small>&#x003C; ASSEMBLED ONES &#x003E;</small> are the angels. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE WIND SHALL CARRY THEM ALL AWAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn858">7</xref></sup> These are Esau and his lords, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): <small>&#x003C; THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES &#x003E;, AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB</small>. (Is. 57:13, cont.:) <small>YET THE ONE WHO TAKES REFUGE IN ME SHALL INHERIT THE LAND</small>. This <small>ONE</small> is Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 37:1): <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &#x003C; IN THE LAND &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>9.3 Genesis 37:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 37:1:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &#x003C; IN THE LAND &#x003E;</small>.] This text is related (to I Chron. 29:15): <small>FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU [AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS]</small>. So are the righteous. The Holy One had made them the essential thing, but they make themselves subordinate. In the case of Abraham, the Holy One had magnified him, as stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>I WILL BLESS YOU AND MAGNIFY YOUR NAME</small>. And so (in Gen. 13:17): <small>ARISE, WALK ABOUT THE LAND &#x003C; THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH AND BREADTH, FOR I AM GIVING IT TO YOU &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; Yet &#x003E; he says to the children of Heth (i.e., to the Hittites, in Gen. 23:4): <small>I AM AN ALIEN AND A TRANSIENT AMONG YOU</small>. So also with Isaac, the Holy One magnified him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND &#x003C; AND REAPED IN THAT YEAR A HUNDREDFOLD, FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM &#x003E;</small>. It also says (in Gen. 26:6): <small>SO ISAAC &#x007B;SOJOURNED&#x007D; [DWELT] IN GERAR</small>. And so with Jacob (according to Gen. 36:6): <small>NOW JACOB DWELT IN THE LAND WHERE HIS FATHER HAD SOJOURNED</small>. It is therefore stated (in I Chron. 29:16): <small>FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS</small>.</p>
<title>9.4 Genesis 37:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 37:1-2:) <small>NOW JACOB DWELT &#x003C; IN THE LAND &#x003E;&#x2026;. THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>. What is written on the matter above (in Gen. 36:15)? <small>THESE ARE THE LORDS OF THE CHILDREN OF ESAU</small>. When Jacob saw them, he became alarmed and said: Who can stand against these?<sup><xref rid="fn859">8</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a goldsmith who would sit and ply his trade. His apprentice raised his eyes and saw a lot of camels who were loaded with straw. He began to say: Who can stand against these? His master said to him: If a spark went out of this furnace, it would burn all of them. So in the case of our father Jacob, when he saw all of Esau&#x2019;s lords, he began to be afraid and said: Who can stand against these? The Holy One said to him: Look at what is written below (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>. By your life, someone shall spring from Joseph, &#x003C; a person &#x003E; who shall burn all of them, as stated (in Obad. 18): <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE A FIRE, AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME, AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW; &#x003C; THEY SHALL BURN IT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R.Hanina said: It is written (in Is. 47:14): <small>SEE, THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE STRAW; FIRE CONSUMES THEM</small>. It is therefore written (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH.</small></p>
<title>9.5 Genesis 37:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>. &#x003C; The interpretation is &#x003E; that Jacob&#x2019;s face was like Joseph&#x2019;s.<sup><xref rid="fn860">9</xref></sup> Where is it shown? Where it says so (in Gen. 37:3): <small>NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH [MORE THAN ALL HIS SONS BECAUSE HE WAS THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE</small>. But look, Benjamin was younger than &#x003C; Joseph &#x003E;; yet it says: &#x003C; Joseph was &#x003E; <small>THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE</small>. It is simply that he had features<sup><xref rid="fn861">10</xref></sup> which resembled him. Ergo (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>]. Just as Jacob raised up tribes; so did Joseph raise up tribes. It is so stated (in Gen. 48:5): <small>EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH SHALL BE MINE LIKE REUBEN AND SIMEON</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Just as Jacob hid from his father for twenty-two years, so did Joseph hide from his father for twenty-two years. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn862">11</xref></sup> R. Levi said: Rabbi Johanan said: Wherever it says, <small>HE WAS</small>, the <small>HE</small> saw three worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn863">12</xref></sup> It is written of Noah (in Gen. 6:9): <small>HE WAS PERFECT</small>. He saw the world when it was inhabited before the flood came, he saw it destroyed, and he saw it afterwards in its restoration. It is therefore said of him: <small>HE WAS</small>. In the case of Moses, it is written (in Exod. 3:1): <small>HE WAS TENDING &#x003C; THE FLOCK OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHRO, THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. He saw Israel before the bondage tightened its grip, he saw the bondage, and &#x007B;they&#x007D; [he] saw them when they had been redeemed. [Of Mordecai it is written] (in Esth. 2:5): <small>THERE WAS (literally: HE WAS) A CERTAIN JEW IN THE CITADEL OF SHUSHAN</small>. He saw them (Israel) before they were enslaved at the hand of Haman, he saw them under the edicts which had been decreed against them, and he saw them in their redemption. Of Job it is written (in Job 1:1): <small>THERE WAS (literally: HE WAS) A MAN IN THE LAND OF &#x003C; UZ &#x003E;</small>, and he saw three worlds. He was whole, he suffered afflictions, and he was healed. So also in the case of Joseph, <small>HE WAS</small> is written of him (in Gen. 37:2): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN WAS (literally: HE WAS) TENDING &#x003C; THE FLOCK WITH HIS BROTHERS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>All the things which happened to Jacob happened to Joseph. It is written in connection with Jacob (in Gen. 31:39): <small>SNATCHED BY DAY</small>. Also in the case of Joseph, it is written of him: <small>FOR I WAS SURELY SNATCHED</small>. Jacob had &#x003C; his brother &#x003E; Esau persecute him; and Joseph had his brothers persecute him. Jacob was enslaved to Laban, and Joseph was enslaved in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn864">13</xref></sup> It is therefore written (in Gen. 37:2) <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH.</small></p>
<title>9.6 Genesis 37:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 37:2:) <small>AND JOSEPH BROUGHT BAD REPORTS OF THEM &#x003C; UNTO HIS FATHER &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BAD REPORTS</small>? That he had said something slanderous against his brothers. And what slanderous thing did he say against them? R. Judah said: He said against them that they would cut a limb from a living animal and eat it.<sup><xref rid="fn865">14</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: You have said something slanderous against the tribes. Tomorrow, by your life, you are going down to Egypt. Then you shall invite them to eat with you, but they shall suspect you there in regard to the ritual slaughtering. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 43:32): <small>THEY SERVED HIM BY HIMSELF, &#x003C; AND THEM BY THEMSELVES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Me&#x2019;ir says: He said to him: My brothers have set their eyes on Canaanite women. The Holy One said to him: You have said something slanderous against your brothers. Tomorrow, by your life, you are going down to Egypt. Then that woman (Potiphar&#x2019;s wife) shall say (in Gen. 39:17): <small>THE HEBREW SLAVE &#x003C; WHOM YOU BROUGHT TO US &#x003E; CAME UNTO ME &#x003C; TO FONDLE ME &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 37:2): <small>AND JOSEPH BROUGHT &#x003C; BAD REPORTS OF THEM UNTO HIS FATHER &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>9.7 Genesis 37:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 37:4:) <small>BUT WHEN HIS BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER LOVED HIM MORE THAN ANY OF HIS BROTHERS, &#x003C; THEY HATED HIM SO THAT THEY COULD NOT SPEAK PEACEABLY (<italic>shalom</italic>) TO HIM &#x003E;</small>. When he came to ask how they were (<italic>shalom</italic>), they would not answer him. Why? Because it was his custom to ask how they were. You have the &#x003C; kind of &#x003E; person who, before coming to power, [asks people how they are. But, after coming to power], his spirit hardens over him, and he is no longer careful to ask the people of the city how they are. Joseph, however, was not like that. Although he had come to power (in Egypt), it was &#x003C; still &#x003E; his custom to ask his brothers how they were. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 43:27): <small>AND HE ASKED THEM HOW THEY WERE</small>. The Holy One said to him: Joseph, you began asking how your brothers were in this world; and they hated you. In the world to come, however, I am pardoning you, removing hate from between you, making you dwell in safety, and making peace between you. So also has David said (in Ps. 133:1): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS FOR BROTHERS TO DWELL TOGETHER</small>.</p>
<title>9.8 Genesis 38:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 38:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH</small>. Let our master instruct us: If a ruin falls on the Sabbath, and it is not known whether Israelites are there or not, is it legitimate to clear away &#x003C; the rubble &#x003E; over them on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Yoma</italic> 8:7): <small>IF A FALLING STRUCTURE FALLS ON SOMEONE [ON THE SABBATH], AND THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER HE IS THERE OR NOT THERE, DOUBT WHETHER HE IS ALIVE OR DEAD, DOUBT WHETHER HE IS A FOREIGNER OR AN ISRAELITE, THEY SHALL CLEAR AWAY [THE RUBBLE] FOR HIS SAKE. IF THEY FIND HIM ALIVE, THEY SHALL CLEAR AWAY &#x003C; THE REST OF THE RUBBLE &#x003E; FOR HIS SAKE; BUT, IF HE IS DEAD, THEY SHALL LEAVE HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn866">15</xref></sup> It is written concerning the Sabbath (in Exod. 31:14): <small>WHOEVER PROFANES IT (the Sabbath) SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>; yet our masters have taught: they shall clear away [the rubble] over one who is alive on the Sabbath. R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: If circumcision, which &#x003C; affects &#x003E; only one of two hundred and forty-eight &#x003C; human &#x003E; organs, overrides the Sabbath, how much the more would two hundred and forty-eight organs under stone override the Sabbath for someone?<sup><xref rid="fn867">16</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Menasya says: Defile one Sabbath for him so that he may keep a lot of Sabbaths. So, if you clear away &#x003C; the rubble &#x003E; over someone to restore a single soul to life, I will also do for you what is written (in Ezek. 37:12): <small>&#x003C; THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD &#x003E; BEHOLD, I WILL OPEN YOUR GRAVES &#x003C; AND RAISE YOU UP OUT FROM YOUR GRAVES, O MY PEOPLE, AND BRING YOU UNTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. A certain heretic (<italic>min</italic>) asked our Rabbi: Is it possible for the dead to live again? Your ancestors do not acknowledge &#x003C; the belief &#x003E;, yet you do acknowledge &#x003C; it &#x003E;&#x0021; What is written about Jacob (in Gen. 37:35)? <small>THEN ALL HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS AROSE TO COMFORT HIM [BUT HE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED]</small>. If he had known that the dead would live &#x003C; again &#x003E;, would he have refused to be comforted and said (ibid., cont.): <small>NO I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING UNTO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>? Our Rabbi said to him: You are the biggest fool in the world. &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because our father Jacob knew through the Holy Spirit that Joseph was alive. For that reason he did not accept consolation over him. After all, one does not accept consolation over one who is alive.<sup><xref rid="fn868">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 37:35): <small>BUT HE REFUSED TO BE COMFORTED</small>. It is simply that our father Jacob said: See, the tribal covenant has been broken&#x0021; How I have toiled to raise up twelve tribes. Now I see that, since Joseph has gone, behold the very covenant has ceased. All the works of the Holy One correspond to twelve tribes: twelve constellations, twelve months, twelve hours in the day, twelve hours in the night, twelve stones which Aaron wore &#x003C; on his breastplate &#x003E;. But now Joseph has gone&#x0021; Behold, the tribal covenant has been broken. But did Jacob not know how to take a wife and sire a son so that there would be twelve tribes? &#x003C; He did not do so &#x003E; simply because he had kept a vow to Laban, as stated (in Gen. 31:50): <small>IF YOU MISTREAT MY DAUGHTERS OR TAKE WIVES BESIDES MY DAUGHTERS</small>, even after their death &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; What did Laban do? He brought him outside. He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>THOUGH NO ONE IS WITH US, SEE, GOD IS A WITNESS</small>&#x2026;. Because of that vow, he was unable to take a wife. When his sons saw that he was complaining so and that he would not accept consolation, they went to Judah and said to him: You have made all this great misfortune for us&#x0021; He said to them: I said to you (in Gen. 37:26): <small>WHAT PROFIT &#x003C; IS THERE IF WE KILL OUR BROTHER AND CONCEAL HIS BLOOD &#x003E;</small>? Now are you saying: What have you done? They said to him: But did we not hearken to you &#x003C; when &#x003E; you said (Gen. 37:27): <small>COME, AND LET US SELL HIM TO THE ISHMAELITES</small>? So we hearkened to you. If you had said: Come, and let us return him to his father, should we not have hearkened to you? In that hour, therefore, they arose and expelled him. How is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Gen. 38:1): <small>JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.</p>
<title>9.9 Genesis 38:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.] This text is related (to Mal. 2:11): <small>JUDAH HAS BEEN FAITHLESS, AND AN ABOMINATION HAS BEEN DONE IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn869">18</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>JUDAH HAS BEEN FAITHLESS</small>? Judah had been deceitful. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as you say (in Mal. 2:14): <small>&#x003C; FOR THE LORD IS A WITNESS BETWEEN YOU (Judah) AND THE WIFE OF YOUR YOUTH &#x003E;, WITH WHOM YOU HAVE BEEN FAITHLESS</small>. Thus it says: Judah was deceitful. Over what was he deceitful? (Mal. 2:11, cont.:) <small>FOR JUDAH HAS PROFANED THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD</small>. See (ibid., cont.): <small>HE HAS MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A FOREIGN GOD</small>. Now it says elsewhere (in Ps. 114:2): <small>JUDAH WAS HIS SANCTUARY</small>, while it says here (in Mal. 2:11): <small>FOR JUDAH HAS PROFANED &#x003C; THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. See (ibid., cont.): <small>HE HAS MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A FOREIGN GOD</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 38:2:) <small>AND JUDAH SAW THERE THE DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN CANAANITE WHOSE NAME WAS SHUA</small>. When? When he had separated from his brothers, as stated (in vs. 1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.</p>
<title>9.10 Genesis 38:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY &#x003C; FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE</small> &#x003E;.] This text is related (to Micah 1:15): <small>I WILL YET BRING TO YOU ONE WHO SHALL DISPOSSESS YOU, &#x003C; O INHABITANT OF MARESHAH; TO ADULLAM SHALL COME THE GLORY OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn870">19</xref></sup> R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differed. The one said: The tribal patriarchs married their sisters, since it is stated (in Gen. 37:35): <small>THEN ALL HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS</small><sup><xref rid="fn871">20</xref></sup> <small>AROSE TO COMFORT HIM</small>. And how many daughters were there? They were simply their &#x003C; brothers&#x2019; twelve &#x003E; twin sisters. &#x003C; A given brother&#x2019;s mother &#x003E; bore twins at his &#x003C; birth &#x003E;, and he would marry her. Moreover, it says so about Benjamin (in Gen. 35:17): <small>BECAUSE THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn872">21</xref></sup> &#x201C;Because this is a son for you&#x201D; is not stated, but <small>BECAUSE THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU</small>, since his mother had &#x003C; already &#x003E; given birth to &#x003C; his &#x003E; twin sister. Ergo (in Gen. 37:35): <small>THEN ALL HIS SONS AND DAUGHTERS AROSE</small>&#x2026;. Hence you learn that they married their sisters. But R. Nehemiah maintains: His daughters were his daughters-in-law. Since one&#x2019;s son-in-law is like his son, and his daughter-in-law, like a daughter, one does not refrain from calling his daughter-in-law his daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn873">22</xref></sup> Our masters have said: Judah, who was the eldest in his father&#x2019;s house, married a Canaanite. Thus it is written (in Gen. 38:2): <small>AND JUDAH SAW THERE &#x003C; THE DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN CANAANITE &#x003E;</small>. And the prophet proclaims (in Micah 1:15): <small>TO ADULLAM SHALL COME THE (HOLY ONE) [GLORY] OF ISRAEL</small>. Ergo (according to Gen. 38:1-2): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY &#x003C; FROM HIS BROTHERS &#x003E; AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE &#x003C; WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH. AND JUDAH SAW THERE THE DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN CANAANITE WHOSE NAME WAS SHUA. SO HE TOOK HER AND WENT IN UNTO HER &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>9.11 Genesis 38:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS</small>. &#x003C; The matter &#x003E; is comparable to a king of flesh and blood when he sits down to judge someone. The judge says to him: Say whether you have killed or not killed. If he says to him: I killed, the judge kills him; but if he does not confess, he does not kill him. However, the Holy One is not like this. Over the one who confesses the Holy One has mercy, as stated (in Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &#x003C; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &#x003E; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. R. Simeon ben Halafta says: The Holy One said to Jerusalem: For what reason have I brought all these judgments upon you? Because you said: I have not sinned, as stated (in Jer. 2:35): <small>BEHOLD, I AM BRINGING YOU TO JUDGMENT FOR SAYING: I HAVE NOT SINNED</small>. However (according to Prov. 28:13): <small>BUT WHOEVER CONFESSES AND FORSAKES &#x003C; HIS TRANSGRESSIONS &#x003E; SHALL OBTAIN MERCY</small>. Ergo (in Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &#x003C; YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS &#x003E;</small>. R. Jose ben Qetsartah said: Flesh and blood makes a path on the mountain or in the valley. Could one possibly make &#x003C; a path &#x003E; in the waters? It is written of the Holy One, however, (in Ps. 77:20 [19]): <small>YOUR WAY WAS IN THE SEA, [AND YOUR PATH IN THE GREAT WATERS]</small>. He makes his way wherever he wants.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT YOUR THOUGHTS</small>. When a king of flesh and blood is provoked with &#x003C; some &#x003E; humans, he expels them from the country. Could he possibly make a way in the sea to bring them down &#x003C; into it &#x003E; and drown them in its midst? [The Holy One, however, is not like that. Rather, when he was angry with the Egyptians, he did make a way in the sea, bring them down &#x003C; into it &#x003E;, and drown them in its midst.] Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 43:16): <small>&#x003C; THUS SAYS THE LORD &#x003E;, WHO SETS HIS WAY IN THE SEA AND A PATH IN THE MIGHTY WATERS</small>. And what one is greater than all of them? The one who (according to Exod. 15:1, 21) brings forth rider and horse, army and warrior. Ergo (in Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &#x003C; YOUR THOUGHTS, AND YOUR WAYS ARE NOT MY WAYS &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 55:8): <small>FOR MY THOUGHTS ARE NOT &#x003C; YOUR THOUGHTS &#x003E;</small>. In the case of Joseph, his brothers sold him to the Midianites, and the Midianites sold him unto the Egyptians. Before Joseph went away, Judah went away to prepare for the final redeemer, i.e., the Messianic King,<sup><xref rid="fn874">23</xref></sup> [for out of him would the Messianic King come forth]. &#x201C;That Judah went&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. R. Johanan said: The one going away depends upon the other. The going away of Judah depends upon the going away of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn875">24</xref></sup> (Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN AWAY TO EGYPT</small> &#x003C; corresponds to &#x003E; (Gen. 38:1) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. Similarly you say on the matter (in Dan. 5:30): <small>IN THAT VERY NIGHT WAS BELSHAZZAR THE CHALDEAN KING SLAIN</small>. What is written next (in Dan. 6:1 [5:31])? <small>AND DARIUS THE MEDE RECEIVED THE KINGDOM</small>. The one destroyer depends upon the other, the destroyer of a house upon the destroyer of a house, the cessation of a kingdom upon the cessation of a kingdom.</p>
<title>9.12 Genesis 38:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY (literally: WENT DOWN)</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WENT DOWN</small>? That they brought him down from his greatness. Why? Because they had appointed him king over themselves. When they had sold Joseph, they came to their father to comfort him, [but] he did [not] wish to be comforted. They said: Now the old man was upset with us. What did they do. They arose and banished him (i.e., Judah), as stated (in Gen. 38:1) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT DOWN</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>. As soon as they had sold Joseph (in Gen. 37:28), what is written (in vs. 29)? <small>WHEN REUBEN RETURNED UNTO THE PIT</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; when he did not find him, <small>HE RENT HIS CLOTHES</small>. In addition they all arose and dispersed, and Judah also dispersed with them. [Ergo] (in Gen. 38:1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.</p>
<title>9.13 Genesis 38:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>[(Gen. 38:1:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 37:14)? <small>PLEASE GO AND SEE [ABOUT YOUR BROTHERS&#x2019; WELFARE AND ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THE FLOCK]</small>. Would the flock know what <small>WELFARE</small> was when he told him &#x003C; to see about &#x003E; <small>THE WELFARE OF THE FLOCK</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn876">25</xref></sup> R. Ayyevu said: A person must pray for whoever is beneficial to him.<sup><xref rid="fn877">26</xref></sup> Because Jacob was benefiting from his flock by consuming the milk and wearing the shorn wool, for that reason he had to ask about their welfare. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 37:14): <small>YOUR BROTHERS&#x2019; WELFARE AND THE WELFARE OF THE FLOCK</small>. (Ibid., cont,:) <small>AND BRING BACK WORD TO ME</small>. They said (in vs. 33): <small>JOSEPH HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn878">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 37:14, cont.:) <small>SO HE SENT HIM AWAY FROM THE HEBRON VALLEY</small>. Is there a valley in Hebron? And is not all of it highland, as stated (in Numb. 13:22): <small>THEN THEY WENT UP INTO THE NEGEB AND CAME TO HEBRON</small>? And so it says (in vs. 17): <small>GO UP THERE INTO THE NEGEB, AND GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY</small>. But here it says: <small>FROM THE HEBRON VALLEY (&#x2018;<italic>MQ</italic>)</small>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn879">28</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: &#x003C; The following events issue &#x003E; out of a profound (rt.: &#x2018;<italic>MQ</italic>) (well) [counsel] which the Holy One has placed between him<sup><xref rid="fn880">29</xref></sup> and himself &#x003C; in the covenant with Abraham between the &#x003C; sacrificial &#x003E; pieces (of Gen. 15:10ff.).</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:15:) <small>THEN A MAN FOUND HIM</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; an angel.<sup><xref rid="fn881">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HERE HE WAS WANDERING &#x003C; IN A FIELD &#x003E;</small>. The angel said to him: Do you not know that you are going astray? He said to him (in vss. 16-17): <small>I AM SEEKING MY BROTHERS&#x2026;. THEN THE MAN SAID: THEY HAVE MOVED ON FROM HERE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FROM HERE</small>? When they see you they become cruel.<sup><xref rid="fn882">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 37:17, cont.:) <small>FOR I HEARD THEM SAYING: LET US GO TO DOTHAN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO DOTHAN (DTYNH)</small>? Our masters have said that the angel was watching out for the Law of the Lord (<italic>DT YH</italic>).</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:17-18:) <small>SO JOSEPH WENT AFTER HIS BROTHERS&#x2026;. NOW THEY SAW HIM FROM AFAR</small>, while he was a mile<sup><xref rid="fn883">32</xref></sup> away.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:19:) <small>SO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER</small>. Who were they? Simon and Levi.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:19-20:) <small>HERE COMES THIS DREAMER. SO COME NOW, AND LET US KILL HIM&#x2026;. &#x003C; AND WE SHALL SEE WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIS DREAMS &#x003E;</small>. R. Isaac said: This Scripture cries out for exposition. Who said (in vs. 20): <small>AND WE SHALL SEE &#x003C; WHAT WILL BECOME OF HIS DREAMS &#x003E;</small>? Actually they had said (at the beginning of the verse): <small>COME, AND LET US KILL HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn884">33</xref></sup> So the Holy Spirit says: Let us observe them. They said (ibid.): <small>COME, AND LET US KILL HIM</small>; and he said (in vs. 7): <small>NOW LOOK, YOUR SHEAVES GATHERED AROUND</small>. Now let us see whose &#x003C; sheaf &#x003E; stands up, yours or mine.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:22:) <small>REUBEN ALSO SAID UNTO THEM: DO NOT SHED BLOOD</small>. Why? &#x003C; It is &#x003E; as the Holy Spirit says (ibid.): <small>IN ORDER TO SAVE HIM FROM THEIR HAND &#x003C; AND RESTORE HIM UNTO HIS FATHER &#x003E;</small>. If Reuben had known that the Holy One would write this verse about him, he would have placed him on his shoulders and brought him unto his father&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn885">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 37:24:) <small>THEN THEY TOOK HIM AND CAST HIM INTO THE PIT, BUT THE PIT WAS EMPTY WITH NO WATER IN IT</small>. There was no water in it; yet there were snakes and scorpions in it.<sup><xref rid="fn886">35</xref></sup> What did Simeon do? When they had put him within the pit, Simeon commanded them to throw great stones upon him in order to kill him; but, when &#x003C; Simeon &#x003E; fell into Joseph&#x2019;s hand, Joseph tossed fattened &#x003C; fowl &#x003E; upon him.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:28:) <small>WHEN MIDIANITE &#x003C; TRADERS &#x003E; PASSED BY, &#x003C; THEY PULLED AND RAISED JOSEPH FROM THE PIT, THEN SOLD JOSEPH FOR TWENTY PIECES OF SILVER TO THE ISHMAELITES &#x003E;</small>. And they (the Midianites in vs. 36) <small>SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT TO POTIPHAR</small>&#x2026;. Three bills of sale<sup><xref rid="fn887">36</xref></sup> were made over him.<sup><xref rid="fn888">37</xref></sup> When he was sold, they all began to cry: Woe (<italic>Way</italic>). Thus it is stated (in Gen. 38:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS (<italic>wayehi</italic>) AT THAT TIME</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY (rt.: <italic>YRD</italic>)</small>. For what sin did he go away?<sup><xref rid="fn889">38</xref></sup> R. Hiyya bar Abba &#x003C; said &#x003E; in the name of R. Johanan: Everyone who begins with a good deed and does not finish it causes himself to bury his wife and children and causes a lowering of status (rt.: <italic>YRD</italic>) for himself. Who was this? This was Judah, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 38:1): <small>THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY</small>.</p>
<p>[(Gen. 38:1, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; THAT JUDAH WENT AWAY FROM HIS BROTHERS AND TURNED ASIDE TO A CERTAIN ADULLAMITE &#x003E; WHOSE NAME WAS HIRAH</small>.] R. Judah bar Simon said: That Hirah from the days of Judah is Hiram from the days of Solomon;<sup><xref rid="fn890">39</xref></sup> and throughout his days he loved this tribe, for so it says (in Gen. 38:12): <small>HIS FRIEND HIRAH THE ADULLAMITE</small>. And it says elsewhere (in I Kings 5:15 [1]): <small>&#x003C; THEN HIRAM KING OF TYRE SENT HIS SERVANTS UNTO SOLOMON &#x003E; &#x2026; FOR HIRAM HAD ALWAYS BEEN A FRIEND TO DAVID</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (continuing in Gen. 38:2): <small>AND JUDAH SAW THERE &#x003C; THE DAUGHTER OF A CERTAIN CANAANITE &#x003E;</small>. There is the one who committed fornication and profited; there is also the one who committed fornication and lost. &#x003C; There is the one who killed and profited; there is also the one who killed and lost. There is the one who stole and profited; there is also the one who stole and lost. There is the one who stole and lost, i.e., Achan (of Joshua 7). There is the one who stole and profited, i.e., Rachel, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 31:19): <small>SO RACHEL STOLE</small>. There is the one who killed and lost (in Numb. 35:16): <small>THE MURDERER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. There is the one who killed and profited, i.e., Phinehas (of Numb. 25:7-13) &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn891">40</xref></sup> There is the one who committed fornication and lost. This is Zimri (of Numb. 25:6-14). There is the one who committed fornication and profited. This is Judah, since from him arose Perez and Hezron, who were going to sire &#x003C; the line of &#x003E; David (according to Ruth 4:18-21) and the Messianic King, who is going to redeem Israel. Look at how many episodes the Holy One brings about before he raises up the Messianic King from Judah&#x0021; That is the one about whom it is written (in Is. 11:2): <small>AND THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD SHALL REST UPON HIM</small>.</p>
<title>9.14 Genesis 39:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT, &#x003C; POTIPHAR, A EUNUCH OF PHARAOH AND CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, BOUGHT HIM &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 37:28): <small>FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. Why does the Holy One love justice? Because he is called the Lord of Justice where it is stated (in Is. 30:18): <small>FOR THE LORD IS A GOD OF JUSTICE</small>. It also says (in Deut. 32:41): <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:28): <small>&#x003C; FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE &#x003E; AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. Do his saints need protection? R. Jeremiah said: See what is written (in I Sam. 2:9): <small>HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS</small>. Do they need protection? It is simply as a popular<sup><xref rid="fn892">41</xref></sup> adage says: They fence in what is fenced in, and they break through what is broken through. Ergo (in Ps. 37:28): <small>AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 37:28): <small>FOR THE LORD LOVES JUSTICE &#x003C; AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS &#x003E;. [THEY ARE PROTECTED FOREVER]</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Joseph. And how did he protect him? [See] what is written (in Gen. 37:28): <small>WHEN MIDIANITE TRADERS PASSED BY, &#x003C; THEY PULLED AND RAISED JOSEPH FROM THE PIT, THEN SOLD JOSEPH FOR TWENTY PIECES OF SILVER TO THE ISHMAELITES &#x003E;</small>. And with what were they laden?<sup><xref rid="fn893">42</xref></sup> Now is it not the custom for camels to bear only &#x003C; foul-smelling &#x003E; &#x2018;<italic>itran</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn894">43</xref></sup> Yet it is written here (in Gen. 37:25): <small>&#x003C; WITH THEIR CAMELS BEARING &#x003E; SPICE, BALSAM, AND LABDANUM</small>&#x0021; It is simply that the Holy One said: Should this righteous man be set in the midst of a bad odor? Instead, I will order a good odor for him. Ergo (in Ps. 37:28) <small>AND DOES NOT ABANDON HIS SAINTS</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE SEED OF THE WICKED ARE CUT OFF</small>. This refers to Potiphar, who did not take him for work but for something else.<sup><xref rid="fn895">44</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He castrated him. Ergo (in Ps. 37:28): <small>BUT THE SEED OF THE WICKED ARE CUT OFF</small>. Now <small>CUT OFF</small> only denotes castration. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 22:24): <small>&#x003C; ANYTHING WITH ITS TESTICLES &#x003E; CRUSHED, SMASHED, TORN OUT, OR CUT OFF &#x003C; YOU SHALL NOT OFFER TO THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. And where is it shown that he was not a eunuch &#x003C; already &#x003E;, but that the Holy One had castrated him? Where it is stated (in Gen. 39:1): &#x003C; <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT &#x003E;, POTIPHAR, A EUNUCH OF PHARAOH</small>.</p>
<title>9.15 Genesis 39:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 10:7): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar, the one who destroyed the temple. When he did not enter it because he was afraid, what did Michael do? He came down, seized his horse, and brought him into the Holy of Holies. So the Holy Spirit says (ibid.): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>, &#x003C; and &#x003E; this refers to Nebuchadnezzar. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND PRINCES WALKING LIKE SLAVES UPON THE GROUND</small>. This refers to Michael, as stated (in Dan. 10:21): <small>&#x003C; AND NO ONE IS MAKING EFFORTS ALONG WITH ME AGAINST THESE &#x003E; (the princes of Persia and Greece) EXCEPT YOUR PRINCE, MICHAEL</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 10:7): <small>I HAVE SEEN SLAVES ON HORSEBACK</small>. &#x003C; The text &#x003E; speaks about Midianites (in Gen. 37:36): <small>THE MIDIANITES SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT</small>. R. Abbin bar Hama the Levite said: The children of a female slave were selling, and the children of a male slave were buying.<sup><xref rid="fn896">45</xref></sup> Between the former and the latter Joseph was sold.</p>
<p>(Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. The tribe was brought down to Egypt. To what is the matter compared? To a cow.<sup><xref rid="fn897">46</xref></sup> When they wanted to bring her to the <italic>makellon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn898">47</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., the slaughterhouse&#x007D;, she did not want to go in. What did they do? They took her offspring &#x007B;to the slaughterhouse&#x007D; and brought it to the <italic>makellon</italic>. When her offspring began to low, its mother unwillingly entered after it. So &#x003C; it was with &#x003E; our father Jacob and his children. They were the cow, as stated (in Hos. 4:16): <small>FOR &#x003C; ISRAEL HAS BALKED &#x003E; LIKE A BALKY COW</small>. Now Joseph went down to Egypt first in order to fulfill a decree which had been decreed about the patriarch, as stated (in Gen. 15:13): <small>WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM</small>. When Jacob was afraid to go down, what did the Holy One do? He brought Joseph down to Egypt, and drew his father unwillingly. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.</p>
<title>9.16 Genesis 39:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN &#x003C; TO EGYPT, POTIPHAR &#x2026; BOUGHT HIM &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN</small>? That he moved the Egyptians from place to place. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as you say (in Gen. 47:21): <small>HE REMOVED THE PEOPLE BY CITIES &#x003C; FROM ONE END OF EGYPT&#x2019;S BORDER TO THE OTHER &#x003E;</small>. Thus he was taking them up from here and putting them there so that they would not taunt the Israelites by calling them exiles &#x003C; and &#x003E; children of exiles.<sup><xref rid="fn899">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 39:1, cont.:) <small>POTIPHAR &#x2026; BOUGHT HIM</small>. Why was he named Potiphar (rt.: <italic>PTPR</italic>). Because he fattened (rt.: <italic>PTM</italic>) bulls (rt.: <italic>PR</italic>) for idol worship.<sup><xref rid="fn900">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why was he named Potiphar? Because he entered Pharaoh&#x2019;s house and made his house potinos<sup><xref rid="fn901">50</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., wealthy&#x007D;. Thus he made the Pharaoh&#x2019;s house shine.</p>
<p>(Gen. 39:1, cont.:) &#x003C; <small>POTIPHAR, A EUNUCH OF PHARAOH AND &#x003E; CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, &#x003C; BOUGHT HIM &#x003E;</small>; nevertheless (according to vs. 2): <small>THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH, &#x003C; AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN &#x003E;</small>. R. Abbahu said: Do I only have &#x003C; evidence that the Lord was with him &#x003E; in prosperity? Where is it shown &#x003C; that the Lord was with him &#x003E;, even in trouble? See, he wrote (in vs. 20): <small>SO JOSEPH&#x2019;S MASTER TOOK HIM AND PUT HIM IN PRISON</small>. Nevertheless (according to vs. 21): <small>THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>. R. Abbahu said: You have someone who loves his friend in prosperity. When trouble came to him, he acted as though he did not know him. But the Holy One is not like that. Rather (according to Gen. 39:20-21): <small>WHILE HE WAS THERE IN PRISON, THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>. &#x003C; Both &#x003E; in trouble and in prosperity, he was with him.</p>
<p>(Gen. 39:2, cont.:) <small>AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN</small>. He used to gird up his loins; and, when his master would say to him: Pour me a glass of water, he would pour it. &#x003C; Then he would say &#x003E; : Give me cold &#x003C; water &#x003E;, and he would give it to him out of the same vessel. When his master would say to him: Give me wine, he would give it to him. &#x003C; Then he would say &#x003E;: Give it to me tripled (i.e., mixed with two parts of water).<sup><xref rid="fn902">51</xref></sup> He would give it to him, and it would become sweet by itself.<sup><xref rid="fn903">52</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (in Gen. 39:2, cont.): <small>AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 39:3:) <small>WHEN HIS MASTER SAW THAT THE LORD WAS WITH HIM</small>&#x2026;. He saw that his works were different. And why all this? (Gen. 39:2:) <small>THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>.</p>
<title>9.17 Genesis 39:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 38:13-14)? <small>AND IT WAS TOLD TO TAMAR, SAYING: &#x003C; HERE IS YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW COMING &#x003E;&#x2026;. SO SHE PUT HER WIDOW&#x2019;S CLOTHES OFF [FROM HER] AND COVERED HERSELF WITH A VEIL. &#x003C; THEN, HAVING WRAPPED HERSELF, SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM &#x003E;</small>. Two women covered themselves with a veil and bore twins. These are Rebekah and Tamar.<sup><xref rid="fn904">53</xref></sup> Of Rebekah it is written (in Gen. 24:65): <small>SO SHE TOOK THE VEIL AND COVERED HERSELF</small>. Then she bore twins, Esau and Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:24): <small>BEHOLD, THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB</small>. As for Tamar, she covered herself with a veil and (according to Gen. 38:27-30) bore twins, Perez and Zerah.</p>
<p>(Gen. 38:14:) <small>SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> (a name which means &#x201C;eyes&#x201D;). R. Joshua ben Levi said: It was at the entrance to which all eyes would be raised in expectation of the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn905">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:14:) <small>SHE SAT DOWN AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> (&#x201C;eyes&#x201D;), &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; at the entrance on which the Holy One looks. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 4:10): <small>&#x003C; THESE ARE &#x003E; THE EYES (a form of <italic>&#x2018;enayim</italic>) &#x007B;OF THE LORD ROAMING&#x007D; [OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM] AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 38:14): <small>AT THE ENTRANCE TO ENAIM</small> (&#x201C;eyes&#x201D;). When one goes out on the road, his eyes look here and there.</p>
<p>(Gen. 38:15:) <small>WHEN JUDAH SAW HER, HE THOUGHT HER TO BE A HARLOT BECAUSE SHE HAD COVERED HER FACE</small>. However, R. Johanan said: <small>SHE COVERED HER FACE</small> as long as she was in her father-in-law&#x2019;s house.<sup><xref rid="fn906">55</xref></sup> From here our masters have said: A man must be acquainted with his daughter-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn907">56</xref></sup> Judah said: This is a harlot. What concern do I have about her? He went on. When he had gone on, she raised her eyes to the Holy One. She said to him: Sovereign of the World, am I to go away empty from the body of this righteous man? Immediately the Holy One sent Michael and brought him back. Where is it shown? Where it is written here (in vs. 16): <small>SO HE TURNED ASIDE UNTO HER</small>. And it is written (in Numb. 22:23): <small>THEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD&#x2026;. SO THE SHE-ASS TURNED ASIDE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn908">57</xref></sup> (Gen. 38:16, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HER: HEY THERE, PLEASE &#x003C; LET ME COME UNTO YOU &#x003E;</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW THAT SHE WAS HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW</small>. (Vs. 17:) <small>AND HE SAID: I WILL SEND YOU A GOAT KID</small>. He said to her (in vs. 18): <small>WHAT PLEDGE SHALL I GIVE YOU? AND SHE SAID: YOUR SEAL&#x2026;. THEN HE CAME UNTO HER, AND SHE CONCEIVED &#x003C; FOR HIM &#x003E;</small>. Scripture lacks nothing; so what is the meaning of <small>SHE CONCEIVED FOR HIM</small>? It simply means that she gave birth to kings like him. (Vs. 24:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS ABOUT THREE MONTHS LATER</small>&#x2026;. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: After three months it is discernible whether a woman is pregnant or not.<sup><xref rid="fn909">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 38:24, cont.:) <small>THAT IT WAS TOLD TO JUDAH, SAYING: YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TAMAR HAS PROSTITUTED HERSELF; AND SHE IS ALSO PREGNANT FOR LEWDNESS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR LEWDNESS</small>? That she would enter a bathhouse and say to her women friends: Go away from me because I am bearing kings. But Isaac, Jacob, and Judah were sitting there in judgment. They said (ibid., cont.): <small>BRING HER OUT AND LET HER BE BURNED</small>. R. Johanan said: In property cases one begins with the eldest, but in capital cases one begins with the youngest and finishes with the eldest.<sup><xref rid="fn910">59</xref></sup> And why does one say: <small>WITH THE YOUNGEST</small>? Because one ascribes corruption to the youngest. Why did he say (in Gen. 34:24): <small>LET HER BE BURNED</small>, and not say: &#x201C;Let her be killed&#x201D;? Ephraim the Disputant said in the name of R. Me&#x2019;ir: She was Shem&#x2019;s daughter, and Shem was a priest. For this reason he said: <small>BRING HER OUT, AND LET HER BE BURNED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn911">60</xref></sup> Now they were dragging her and bringing her out against her will, as stated (in Gen. 38:25): <small>AS SHE WAS BEING BROUGHT OUT</small>. Now while she was being brought out, she sought &#x003C; the tokens of &#x003E; the pledge but did not find them. In that hour she raised her eyes to the heavens. Immediately the Holy One sent her others.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: When she came out, the Holy One made her eyes light up and she found them after she had lost them because there is no finding except of what is <small>LOST</small>. Thus it is written (in Lev. 5:22): <small>OR HAS FOUND WHAT IS LOST</small>. Immediately she sent &#x003C; her tokens of the pledge &#x003E; to Judah, (according to Gen. 38:25) <small>THE ONE TO WHOM THESE BELONG</small>. She said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE</small> your Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn912">61</xref></sup> Immediately (in vs. 26): <small>JUDAH GAVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT</small>. In that hour a heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) came forth and said to him: You are to say: [She is pregnant from me; lest] she be burned. And afterwards he confessed: The affair stemmed from me. The Holy One said to Him: Judah, for me you have saved three lives from the fire and one (i.e., Joseph) from the pit. By your life, I will save &#x003C; four lives &#x003E; for you just as you have saved &#x003C; them &#x003E; for me. Who are they? Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the fiery furnace (in Dan. 3:20-27) and Daniel from the lions&#x2019; pit (in Dan. 6:16-23). What is written about them (in Dan. 1:6)? <small>NOW AMONG THOSE FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH WERE DANIEL, HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH</small>. &#x201C;From Hezekiah&#x2019;s children&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn913">62</xref></sup> is not written here, but <small>FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH</small>. For what reason? For the reason that he had saved Tamar and her children &#x003C; from the fire &#x003E; and Joseph from the pit. When Reuben heard that Judah had confessed, he immediately arose also and said: I also have violated my father&#x2019;s beds (in Gen. 35:22). Eliphaz said to Job (in Job 15:17-18): <small>I WILL INFORM YOU; HEARKEN TO ME. NOW THIS HAVE I SEEN, AND I WILL DECLARE THAT WHICH SAGES HAVE TOLD</small>. These &#x003C; sages &#x003E; are Reuben and Judah. Therefore (in vs. 19): <small>TO THEM ALONE WAS THE LAND GIVEN</small>. When? (Ibid.:) <small>AND NO STRANGER PASSED AMONG THEM</small>. When Moses came to bless them, what did he say (in Deut. 33:6-7)? <small>MAY REUBEN LIVE AND NOT DIE&#x2026;. AND THIS IS FOR JUDAH</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>9.18 Genesis 39:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This text is related (to Hos. 11:4): <small>WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN, WITH BANDS OF LOVE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn914">63</xref></sup> Israel would have deservedly gone down to Egypt in chains and <italic>collaria</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn915">64</xref></sup> just as they went down to Babylon, had not Joseph gone first. All that happened to Joseph happened to Zion.<sup><xref rid="fn916">65</xref></sup> That which is written of Joseph is written of Zion. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): <small>BEAUTIFULLY BUILT WITH A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE</small>; and it is written of Zion (in Lam. 2:15): <small>A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY</small>. For this reason Jacob was afraid to go down to Egypt: Because it had been decreed over Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN IN A LAND &#x003C; NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM &#x003E;</small>. So he dwelt in the land of Canaan. They came and said to him: Joseph was sold when he resembled a bull. It is so stated (of Joseph in Deut. 33:17): <small>LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY</small>. And here he is ensconced in Egypt (Gen. 45:26)&#x0021; When Jacob heard this, he said: See, I am going down to Egypt even though I am paying Abraham&#x2019;s bill (of indebtedness). Immediately (it says in Gen. 45:28): <small>THEN ISRAEL SAID: ENOUGH, MY SON JOSEPH IS ALIVE. &#x003C; I WILL GO AND SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE &#x003E;</small>. Immediately all the tribes went down with him. Who caused them to go down to Egypt? Joseph. (Hos. 11:4:) <small>WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN</small>. This <small>&#x003C; HUMAN &#x003E;</small> is Joseph. (Gen. 39:1:) <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.</p>
<title>9.19 Genesis 39:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>. Love is what Jacob had for Rachel, as stated (in Gen. 29:18): <small>AND JACOB LOVED RACHEL</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.): <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL</small>. Thus Rachel was jealous of her sister. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; the love of Jonathan and David. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 18:1): <small>JONATHAN&#x2019;S SOUL WAS BOUND TO THE SOUL OF DAVID, AND JONATHAN LOVED HIM AS HIS OWN SOUL</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.:) <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL (<italic>Sh&#x2019;</italic><italic>WL</italic>)</small>. Thus Saul (<italic>Sh&#x2019;WL</italic>) was jealous of David. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 8:6): <small>FOR LOVE IS AS STRONG AS DEATH</small>. Love is what Jacob had for Joseph, as stated (in Gen. 37:3): <small>NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH</small>. (Cant. 8:6, cont.:) <small>JEALOUSY IS AS SEVERE AS SHEOL</small>. Thus his (Joseph&#x2019;s) brothers were jealous of him. So what is <small>LOVE</small> doing beside <small>JEALOUSY</small> (in the same verse)? And what caused Joseph to come into the hands of jealousy? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because of the love with which his father loved him to excess.</p>
<title>9.20 Genesis 39:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. There were three natures within him. &#x003C; He was &#x003E; a Torah scholar, a prophet, and one who nourished his brothers. &#x003C; He was &#x003E; a Torah scholar, for it is so written (in Gen. 37:3): <small>BECAUSE HE WAS THE CHILD OF HIS OLD AGE (<italic>ZEN</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn917">66</xref></sup> It is also written (in Deut. 32:7): <small>ASK YOUR FATHER, AND HE WILL INFORM YOU; [</small><small>YOUR ELDERS (rt.: <italic>ZQN</italic>), AND THEY WILL TELL YOU]</small>. And where is it shown that he was prophet? Where it is stated (in Gen. 37:2): <small>SINCE HE WAS A YOUTH WITH THE CHILDREN OF BILHAH</small>&#x2026;. It is also written (in Exod. 33:11): <small>HIS ATTENDANT, JOSHUA BIN NUN, A YOUTH</small>. Again it is written (in I Sam. 2:21): <small>AND THE YOUTH SAMUEL GREW UP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn918">67</xref></sup> And where is it shown that he fed his brothers? Where it is stated (in Gen. 50:21): <small>SO NOW, FEAR NOT; I WILL NOURISH YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>9.21 Genesis 39:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>&#x2026;. What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 38:29)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, AS HE DREW BACK HIS HAND &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; [SO HIS NAME WAS CALLED PEREZ]</small>. Here is kingship (according to Ruth 4:18): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF PEREZ</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn919">68</xref></sup> (Gen. 38:30:) <small>THEN AFTERWARDS HIS BROTHER CAME OUT</small>. Here is a priest. Then afterwards (in Gen. 39:1): <small>WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT</small>, the Holy One simply brought them the good news that, wherever they went, they would have the services of a king and a priest. How so? In Egypt &#x003C; they had &#x003E; a king and a priest, as stated (in Exod. 7:8): <small>NOW THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON</small>&#x2026;. Also in their Exodus &#x003C; they had a king and a priest &#x003E; (according to Ps. 77:21 [20]): <small>YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK BY THE HAND OF MOSES AND AARON</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 10 Genesis, Parashah X: <italic>Miqqets</italic></title>
<title>10.1 Genesis 41:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 41:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS THAT PHARAOH DREAMED</small>. This text is related (to Job 28:3): <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS, AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn920">1</xref></sup> There is an end to everything: to the mountains, the hills, the wind, and the waters, even to empty words, even to the darkness. Where is it shown for mountains? Where it is stated (in Is. 40:12): <small>WHO WEIGHS MOUNTAINS WITH A BALANCE AND HILLS WITH SCALES</small>. Where is it shown for the wind? Where it is stated (in Job 28:25): <small>TO FIX A WEIGHT FOR THE WIND</small>. And where is it shown for the waters? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HE HAS FIXED THE WATERS BY MEASURE</small>. Where is it shown for darkness? (Job 28:3:) <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS</small>. Every single thing, when it comes to a person, even afflictions, has an end. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. So the Holy One sits and searches out whether afflictions are required for &#x003C; a person &#x003E; or not, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. Resh Laqish said: Who has been the cause of this person having afflictions &#x007B;and deep darkness&#x007D; come upon him? [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>A STONE OF DARKNESS AND SHADOWY DEATH</small>.] <small>A STONE</small>: This is the evil drive (<italic>yetser hara</italic>) because it is comparable to the stone of which it is stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn921">2</xref></sup> Ergo (in Job 28:3): <small>A STONE OF DARKNESS AND SHADOWY DEATH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 28:3): <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS</small>. All the afflictions which come upon humankind have an end to them, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Joseph when he was bound in the prison. He had been there ten years, and he was to get out in eleven. Ergo (in Job 28:3): <small>HE PUTS AN END TO THE DARKNESS</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SEARCHES OUT EVERY LIMIT</small>? That, when his time arrived to get out, the Holy One sat down, searched out, and saw that he was required to be in the prison two more years because he had trusted in the chief of the cupbearers in that he said to him two times (in Gen. 40:14): <small>BUT KEEP ME IN YOUR REMEMBRANCE (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) &#x2026; AND MENTION (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) ME UNTO PHARAOH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn922">3</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: You trusted in him with two rememberings (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>). By your life, do two more years &#x003C; in prison &#x003E; . Thus it is stated (in Gen. 41:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS</small>.</p>
<title>10.2 Genesis 41:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 41:1:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 14:23): <small>IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT</small>. Our masters have said: Even in the case of cold water, when they make it hot, it becomes a benefit to the body. <small>IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn923">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 14:23): <small>IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about labors over Torah. Anyone who troubles himself more than his colleague over the Torah shall have benefit and gain. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT TALK FROM THE LIPS &#x003C; LEADS &#x003E; ONLY TO A LOSS</small>. Anything restraining one&#x2019;s lips so that he does not labor in the Torah <small>&#x003C; LEADS &#x003E; ONLY TO A LOSS</small>. Once upon a time there was a certain student who was outstanding, and his name was R. Eleazar ben Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn924">5</xref></sup> He was regularly at his studies. Look at how regular in his studies he was. &#x003C; But &#x003E; while he was sweating in the bathhouse, he would stand at his chamber pot and skip his studies. Because he did not grasp &#x003C; them &#x003E; with his lips, he became sick and forgot his studies. What caused &#x003C; this &#x003E; for him? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because he did not grasp &#x003C; his studies &#x003E; with his lips. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 14:23): <small>BUT TALK FROM THE LIPS &#x003C; LEADS &#x003E; ONLY TO A LOSS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 14:23): <small>IN ALL TOIL THERE IS PROFIT</small>. This was Joseph, who suffered in prison and had gain.<sup><xref rid="fn925">6</xref></sup> <small>NOW</small> (according to Gen. 42:6) <small>JOSEPH WAS THE GOVERNOR</small>. (Prov. 14:23:) <small>BUT TALK FROM THE LIPS &#x003C; LEADS &#x003E; ONLY TO A LOSS</small>. Because he had spoken &#x003C; merely &#x003E; with his lips and said &#x003C; to a cupbearer rather than to God &#x003E; (in Gen. 40:14): <small>BUT KEEP ME IN YOUR REMEMBRANCE</small>, the Holy One said to him: By your life, inasmuch as you spoke improper words with your lips; by your life, you are doing two years more in the prison. Thus it is stated (in Genesis 41:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS</small>.</p>
<title>10.3 Genesis 41:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 40:23): <small>YET THE CHIEF CUPBEARER DID NOT REMEMBER JOSEPH</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: <small>YET &#x003C; THE CHIEF CUPBEARER &#x003E; DID NOT REMEMBER</small>. He had been remembered, and he was married.<sup><xref rid="fn926">7</xref></sup> But (ibid.) <small>HE FORGOT HIM</small>. He had said outside: I will go and tell Pharaoh about him. Immediately: <small>HE FORGOT HIM</small>. Until the proper time had arrived for him to leave, the Holy One brought false charges against him in order to slander him. Thus it is stated (in Genesis 41:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THE END OF TWO FULL YEARS</small>.</p>
<p>[(Genesis 41:1, cont.:) <small>THAT PHARAOH DREAMED</small>.] R. Hiyya bar Abba said: <small>&#x003C; THAT PHARAOH &#x003E; DREAMED</small>. Does a dead dog dream? &#x003C; In this case, he was granted prophetic dreams &#x003E; merely a short while for the sake of the righteous one.</p>
<p>(Genesis 41:1, cont.:) <small>AND HERE HE WAS STANDING OVER THE NILE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn927">8</xref></sup> The wicked ones establish themselves over their gods,<sup><xref rid="fn928">9</xref></sup> but the righteous are secure over their Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn929">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 41:2:) <small>AND HERE WERE &#x003C; SEVEN COWS COMING UP &#x003E; FROM THE NILE &#x2026; AND THEY GRAZED AMONG THE <italic>AHU</italic></small>. <sup><xref rid="fn930">11</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small><italic>AHU</italic></small>? Simply that, when the good years come, the people become brothers (<italic>ahin</italic>) to each other. But, when bad years come, the people become aliens (<italic>aherim</italic>) to their colleagues. For this reason it says (in Gen. 41:3): <small>&#x003C; THEN HERE WERE &#x003E; SEVEN ALIEN (<italic>aherot</italic>) COWS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn931">12</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <italic>aherot?</italic> That the one group saw the other and turned away their faces from them.</p>
<title>10.4 Genesis 41:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 41:8:) <small>&#x003C; AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING &#x003E; THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED (rt.: <italic>P&#x2018;M</italic>)</small>, in that it was beating against him like a gong (rt.: <italic>P&#x2018;M</italic>). Another interpretation (of Gen. 41:8): <small>THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED</small>. It is written of Nebuchadnezzar (in Dan. 2:1): <small>HIS SPIRIT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED</small>; and it is written of Pharaoh (in Gen. 41:8): <small>THAT HIS SPIRIT WAS TROUBLED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn932">13</xref></sup> Why? Pharaoh knew the dream but did not know its interpretation; therefore, he was confused by one confusion. But Nebuchadnezzar knew neither the dream nor its interpretation; therefore, &#x003C; he was confused &#x003E; by two confusions. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:1): <small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR DREAMED DREAMS</small>. R. Hiyya said: He dreamed one dream. Then why does it say: <small>DREAMS</small> (in the plural)? Because he had forgotten the dream. R. Jannay says: He dreamed two dreams, one of an image (in Dan. 2:31-35) and one of a tree (in Dan. 4:7-14).</p>
<p>(Dan. 2:1:) <small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR DREAMED DREAMS. ALSO HIS SPIRIT WAS DEEPLY TROUBLED</small>, and his sleep was confused. Why? Because the dream was of himself in that it showed him his kingdom. For that reason (ibid.): <small>AND HE SUFFERED SLEEPLESSNESS</small>.</p>
<p>(Dan. 2:2:) <small>SO THE KING SAID TO SUMMON THE DIVINERS, THE ENCHANTERS, AND THE SORCERERS</small>. What were the diviners (<italic>HRTWMYM</italic>)? R. Simon said: (<italic>HRTMYM</italic>) is written &#x003C; here &#x003E; (defectively without the <italic>W</italic>). These are the ones who consult the bones (<italic>TYMY</italic>) of the dead. <sup><xref rid="fn933">14</xref></sup> <small>THE ENCHANTERS</small>. What are the enchanters (&#x2019;<italic>ShPYM</italic>)? These are the ones who push fortune. So this word is nothing but a word of duress. Thus it is stated (in Amos 8:4): <small>HEAR THIS, YOU WHO OPPRESS (<italic>Sh&#x2019;PYM</italic>) THE NEEDY</small>. (Dan. 2:2:) <small>AND THE SORCERERS</small> are actually sorcerers.</p>
<p>(Dan. 2:2, cont.:) <small>TO TELL THE KING HIS DREAMS. SO THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING</small>. They all came lest one of them have an advantage. He began to speak with them, as stated (in Dan. 2:3-4): <small>AND THE KING SAID: I HAVE DREAMED A DREAM, AND MY SPIRIT IS DEEPLY TROUBLED TO KNOW THE DREAM. THEN THE CHALDEANS SPOKE TO THE KING IN ARAMAIC: O KING, LIVE FOR EVER&#x0021; TELL YOUR SERVANTS THE DREAM, AND</small> &#x007B;<small>ITS INTERPRETATION WILL BE DECLARED</small>&#x007D; <small>[WE WILL DECLARE ITS INTERPRETATION]</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn934">15</xref></sup> Nebuchadnezzar said to them: I know the dream. If I tell it to you, you may tell me words of falsehood when you say: This is its interpretation. Instead, you tell the dream, and &#x003C; then &#x003E; I will know that you are telling me its &#x003C; true &#x003E; interpretation. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:6-7): <small>&#x007B;THEREFORE, TELL ME THE DREAM AND I WILL KNOW THAT YOU SHALL DECLARE ITS INTERPRETATION.&#x007D; [BUT IF YOU DECLARE THE DREAM AND ITS INTERPRETATION], &#x003C; THEN YOU SHALL RECEIVE GIFTS, PRESENTS, AND GREAT HONOR &#x003E;&#x2026;. THEY ANSWERED HIM A SECOND TIME AND SAID &#x007B;TO THE KING&#x007D;: LET THE KING TELL THE DREAM TO HIS SERVANTS, AND WE WILL DECLARE &#x007B;ITS&#x007D; [THE] INTERPRETATION</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to them: Just as I tell you to tell me, and you tell me to tell [you]; so you think that you will converse with me until noon and go away. (Dan. 2:9:) <small>THAT, IF YOU DO NOT MAKE THE DREAM KNOWN TO ME, THERE IS BUT ONE VERDICT FOR YOU</small>. I am putting forth one <italic>keleusis</italic><sup><xref rid="fn935">16</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., your decree&#x007D; concerning you, that you shall be killed. (Dan. 2:9, cont.:) <small>FOR YOU HAVE DECIDED TO TELL ME SOMETHING FALSE AND CORRUPT</small>. You have come in to speak deceitful words before me <small>UNTIL</small> (according to Dan. 2:9, cont.) <small>CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE</small>. (Dan. 2:10-11:) <small>THE CHALDEANS ANSWERED THE KING AND SAID: THERE IS NOT A PERSON ON THE EARTH WHO CAN DECLARE THE KING&#x2019;S MATTER BECAUSE NO GREAT AND POWERFUL KING HAS ASKED A THING LIKE THIS OF ANY DIVINER, ENCHANTER, OR CHALDEAN. ALSO THE THING THAT THE KING IS ASKING IS DIFFICULT, AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL DECLARE IT BEFORE THE KING, EXCEPT THE GODS, WHOSE DWELLING IS NOT WITH HUMAN FLESH</small>. While the Sanctuary was standing, when someone wanted an oracle, he would ask through Urim and Thummim. While the eternal God dwelt with human flesh, when someone wanted an oracle, he would speak to him. &#x003C; The king said &#x003E; : Go and ask him. They said: His &#x003C; dwelling &#x003E; (according to vs. 11, end) <small>IS NOT WITH HUMAN FLESH</small>. (Vs. 11, beginning:) <small>ALSO THE THING THAT THE KING IS ASKING IS DIFFICULT (rt.: <italic>YQR</italic>)</small>. Prophecy is necessary, but nothing is so difficult (rt.: <italic>YQR</italic>) as prophecy, even as you say (in I Sam. 3:1): <small>AND THE WORD OF THE LORD WAS RARE (<italic>YQR</italic>)</small>&#x2026;. (Vs. 11, cont.:) <small>AND THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL DECLARE IT BEFORE THE KING. ELSE (&#x2019;<italic>HRN</italic>)</small> is &#x003C; actually &#x003E; Aaron (&#x2019;<italic>HRN</italic>). They said to him: If you had had one of the children of the children of Aaron, he would have wrapped himself in Urim and Thummim and told you &#x003C; the dream &#x003E;. (Dan. 2:12:) <small>WHEREUPON THE KING BECAME ANGRY AND VERY FURIOUS</small>. He was filled with wrath over them. He said to them: And so the Sanctuary was beautiful; yet you gave me counsel to destroy it. Immediately (we read in vs. 12, cont.): <small>AND HE SAID TO DESTROY ALL THE SAGES OF BABYLON</small>. A command<sup><xref rid="fn936">17</xref></sup> went out to this effect, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>THEN THE DECREE WENT OUT THAT THE SAGES WERE TO BE KILLED. ALSO DANIEL AND HIS FRIENDS WERE ABOUT (rt.: <italic>B</italic>&#x2018;&#x2019;) TO BE KILLED</small>. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: &#x003C; The text really means &#x003E;: It was required (rt.: <italic>B</italic>&#x2018;&#x2019;) for Daniel and his friends to be killed. Daniel began saying to Arioch (in vs. 15): <small>WHY IS THE DECREE FROM THE KING SO URGENT? THEN ARIOCH INFORMED DANIEL OF THE MATTER</small>. Daniel said to him: I will reveal the matter to him. <small>THEN</small> (in Dan. 2:25) <small>ARIOCH HASTILY BROUGHT DANIEL IN BEFORE THE KING</small>. Nebuchadnezzar said to him (in vs. 26): <small>ARE YOU ABLE TO MAKE KNOWN TO ME THE DREAM WHICH I SAW AND ITS INTERPRETATION</small>? Daniel answered him immediately and explained to him. But his son Belshazzar said to Daniel, (on a later occasion) when he came before him to explain to him what the hand had written (in Dan. 5:5)&#x2014;At that time he said to him (in Dan. 5:13): <small>ARE YOU DANIEL, THE ONE WHO COMES FROM THE CHILDREN OF THE CAPTIVITY OF JUDAH &#x003C; WHOM MY FATHER THE KING BROUGHT FROM JUDAH &#x003E;</small>? R. Jose therefore explains that Nebuchadnezzar also had said this to him: <small>ARE YOU DANIEL</small>? Did he not recognize him when he said to him: <small>ARE YOU DANIEL</small>? It is simply that he said to him: Do you have power to tell me this thing? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: When? he said to him: Not &#x003C; after &#x003E; thirty days nor &#x003C; after &#x003E; twenty days. Just wait one night for me. (Dan. 2:17:) <small>THEN DANIEL WENT TO HIS HOUSE AND MADE THE MATTER KNOWN TO HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH</small>, so that they would pray with him, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>IN ORDER TO SEEK MERCY FROM BEFORE THE GOD &#x003C; OF HEAVEN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Vs. 19:) <small>THEN THE MYSTERY WAS REVEALED TO DANIEL IN A NIGHT VISION. THEN DANIEL BLESSED THE GOD OF HEAVEN</small>. In this world prophecy belongs to one in a thousand, but in the world to come prophecy will belong to everyone. It is so stated (in Joel 3:1 [2:28]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS AFTERWARD THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH SO THAT YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn937">18</xref></sup></p>
<title>10.5 Genesis 42:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 42:1:) <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>. This verse is related (to Prov. 20:12): <small>&#x007B;A SEEING EYE AND A HEARING EAR&#x007D; [A HEARING EAR AND A SEEING EYE], THE LORD HAS MADE THEM BOTH</small>. What did Solomon see to &#x003C; make him &#x003E; say this? Did the Holy One not make the whole body? &#x003C; We might infer that he did not do so &#x003E; because &#x003C; Solomon &#x003E; spoke &#x003C; only &#x003E; about the ear and the eye. Rather, all of one&#x2019;s members are going to render account except the ear and the eye. Why? It is simply that the eye sees involuntarily, and the ear hears involuntarily. In the case of the hands, however, if one is unwilling, one does not steal. So also with the feet. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 20:12): <small>A SEEING EYE AND A HEARING EAR</small>&#x2026;. Come and see. All that time when Joseph had been sold, Jacob and his children did not know that Joseph was alive. But, when the proper time arrived, the Holy One gave authorization to the eyes and the ears. It is so stated (in Gen. 42:1-2): <small>THEN JACOB <italic>SAW</italic> THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT&#x2026;. NOW I <italic>HEAR</italic> THAT THERE IS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>10.6 Genesis 42:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 42:1:) <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>.] This text is related (to Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE &#x003C; AND SEALS UP THE STARS &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn938">19</xref></sup> &#x007B;It simply tells about Jacob and his children, since they were likened to them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>.&#x007D; Look at all Job&#x2019;s wisdom&#x0021; Now who does not know that, if the Holy One tells the sun or the stars not to shine, they do not shine, as stated (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small> &#x2026; ? It simply tells about Jacob and his children, [since they were likened to them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>]. (Job 9:7:) <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>. For the twenty-two years that Joseph stayed away from his brothers in Egypt, the Holy Spirit was hidden from Jacob and his children. He was no farther from them than a journey of four or five days; but they did not know that he was in Egypt. Now Jacob and his children had previously been great prophets. Do you want to understand? When Joseph had told them his dream, what did he say (in Gen. 37:10)? <small>ARE WE TO COME, I AND YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR BROTHERS, AND BOW DOWN &#x003C; TO THE GROUND FOR YOU &#x003E;</small> ? Then, when he had been sold, they did not know where he was. Ergo (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>. Why so? So that the prophets would not be boastful. The Holy One therefore made his power known to them to show them that they were nothing. And so you find with the greatest of the prophets (i.e., Moses). Because he had said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &#x003C; YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn939">20</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Are you able to interpret a difficult case? By your life, I am showing you&#x0021; So, when the affair of the daughters of Zelophehad arrived, he began to have difficulties with it. When he did not know what to say, he brought their cause before the <small>LORD</small>, as stated (in Numb. 27:5): <small>THEN MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to him: Was it not you who said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &#x003C; YOU ARE TO BRING UNTO ME &#x003E;</small> &#x2026; ? See, you do not know what the women know. (Numb. 27:7:) <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>. These women have judged better than you. And so also in the case of Samuel, when he was measured against Moses and Aaron. Because he had said (in I Sam. 9:19): <small>I AM THE SEER</small>, the Holy One said to him: You have said: <small>I AM THE SEER</small>&#x0021; By your life, tomorrow I am showing you whether you are a seer. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 16:1): <small>FILL YOUR HORN WITH OIL AND GO; &#x007B;COME&#x007D; [I AM SENDING YOU] UNTO JESSE THE BETHLEHEMITE BECAUSE I HAVE CHOSEN A KING FOR MYSELF AMONG HIS SONS</small>. When he had gone, what is written (in I Sam. 16:6)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN HE HAD COME, THAT HE SAW ELIAB AND SAID: SURELY THE LORD&#x2019;S ANOINTED IS STANDING BEFORE HIM</small>. The Holy One said to him: Are you the one who said (in I Sam. 9:19): <small>I AM THE SEER</small>? (I Sam. 16:7:) <small>DO NOT LOOK UPON HIS APPEARANCE</small>&#x2026;. And so also in the case of Jacob [and his children], they were prophets and sages, and nothing was hidden from them. When Joseph was sold, they did not know about him until the Holy One [wanted] &#x003C; them to know &#x003E;. Ergo (in Job 9:7): <small>THE ONE WHO TELLS THE SUN NOT TO SHINE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>10.7 Genesis 42:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>&#x2026;. R. Joshua said: &#x003C; He was &#x003E; a grand old man sitting in his house and seeing what there was in Egypt. The Scripture says (in Eccl. 7:19): <small>&#x007B;AND&#x007D; WISDOM WILL STRENGTHEN A SAGE MORE THAN TEN RULERS</small>&#x2026;. This refers to Jacob, who was sitting and seeing what there was in Egypt, while his ten sons were coming in [and out] without knowing &#x003C; about it &#x003E;.</p>
<title>10.8 Genesis 42:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN (<italic>ShBR</italic>)</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 146:5): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOSE HELP IS THE GOD OF JACOB, WHOSE HOPE (<italic>SBR</italic>) IS IN THE LORD HIS GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn940">21</xref></sup> The Holy One showed him that Joseph was alive.</p>
<p>(Gen. 42:1, cont.:) <small>THEN JACOB SAID TO HIS CHILDREN: WHY ARE YOU MAKING YOURSELVES CONSPICUOUS</small>? Jacob said to them: Will you please hide yourselves, for there is nothing more harmful than the evil eye?<sup><xref rid="fn941">22</xref></sup> And so you find in the case of the former tables (of the Torah), because they had been given in grandeur (before all eyes), they had been shattered. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small>. But when the second tables were given, no one saw them but Moses, since it is stated (in Exod. 34:3): <small>BUT LET NO ONE COME UP WITH YOU</small>&#x2026;. So also Jerusalem would not have been destroyed except for the evil eye. Thus it is stated (in Lam. 2:15-16): <small>IS THIS THE CITY WHICH THEY CALLED A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY, A JOY TO THE WHOLE EARTH? &#x003C; ALL YOUR ENEMIES JEER OVER YOU; THEY HISS AND GNASH THEIR TEETH; THEY SAY: WE HAVE DESTROYED HER&#x0021; INDEED, THIS IS THE DAY WE HAD HOPED FOR. WE HAVE FOUND IT; WE HAVE SEEN IT &#x003E;</small>. It also says (in Lam. 3:51): <small>MY EYE DOES EVIL TO MY SOUL BECAUSE OF ALL THE DAUGHTERS OF MY CITY</small>. Jacob therefore said: Do not look at yourselves. It is so stated (in Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAID TO HIS CHILDREN: WHY ARE YOU MAKING YOURSELVES CONSPICUOUS</small>? Rather walk privately (rt.: <italic>TsN</italic>&#x2018;), as stated (in Micah 6:8): <small>HE HAS TOLD YOU, O HUMAN, WHAT IS GOOD&#x2026;. AND TO WALK HUMBLY (rt.: <italic>TsN</italic>&#x2019;) WITH YOUR GOD</small>.</p>
<title>10.9 Genesis 42:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE, THE ELDERS WHO UNDERSTAND JUDGMENT</small>. Not everyone who is engaged in the Torah becomes wise, but (according to Job 32:8) <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. Who stated this verse? Elihu stated it. When? In the hour that Job&#x2019;s friends were rebuking him and he was answering them. When Job had dismissed them, Elihu saw that they were unable to answer him, as stated (in Job 32:5): <small>BUT WHEN ELIHU SAW THAT THERE WAS NO ANSWER</small>&#x2026;. At that time he said to them (in vs. 9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>, nor does everyone who is engaged in the Torah become wise; but (according to Job 32:8) <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. &#x003C; There is no wisdom &#x003E; unless the Holy One has put a spirit within him for him to be habitual in his study, as stated (in Job 32:8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. A matron<sup><xref rid="fn942">23</xref></sup> queried R. Jose ben Halafta.<sup><xref rid="fn943">24</xref></sup> She said to him: Is it not true that all the glory of the Holy One consists in his giving wisdom to the wise? It is so stated (in Dan. 2:20-21): <small>&#x003C; LET THE NAME OF THE LORD BE BLESSED FOR EVER AND EVER, FOR WISDOM AND MIGHT ARE HIS &#x003E;&#x2026;. HE GIVES WISDOM TO THE WISE</small>. Should it not rather have said: &#x201C;He gives wisdom to the foolish&#x201D;? He said to her: Do you have jewels?<sup><xref rid="fn944">25</xref></sup> She said to him: Yes. He said to her: If someone comes to borrow your jewels, would you lend them to him? She said to him: If he were someone <italic>hikanos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn945">26</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., someone wise&#x007D;, I would lend him my jewels. He said to her. You would only lend your jewels to someone <italic>hikanos</italic>; should the Holy One give wisdom to the foolish? &#x003C; Daniel &#x003E; therefore said (in Dan. 2:21): <small>HE GIVES WISDOM TO THE WISE</small>. Elihu said: &#x003C; The Holy One &#x003E; does not give to everyone who asks. Ergo (in Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>. [But (in vs. 8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON.</small></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 32:9): <small>IT IS NOT THE MANY WHO ARE WISE</small>.] &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Jacob. Jacob said to his children: It is not because you are many that you are wise, since you are ten and I am &#x003C; only &#x003E; one. Now I say to you: Go down to Egypt, but you do not want to go down. I have a vision in the Holy Spirit that there is grain there. Thus it is stated (in Job 32:8): <small>SURELY IT IS THE SPIRIT IN A PERSON</small>. I have seen that Joseph is there. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 42:1): <small>THEN JACOB SAW THAT THERE WAS GRAIN IN EGYPT</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 42:2:) <small>GO DOWN THERE</small>. There is a going down for them. Go down and subdue the land before your children. &#x007B;(Ibid., cont.:) <small>GO DOWN THERE AND BUY FOR US FROM THERE</small>&#x007D; [(Gen. 44:25:) <small>RETURN AND BUY US</small>] <small>A LITTLE FOOD</small>. &#x003C; Go down and subdue the land &#x003E; before those about whom it is written (in Deut. 7:7:) <small>INDEED YOU ARE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES</small>.</p>
<title>10.10 Genesis 42:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 42:3:) <small>SO JOSEPH&#x2019;S TEN BROTHERS WENT DOWN &#x003C; TO BUY GRAIN IN EGYPT &#x003E;</small>. Jacob said to them: Will you please not &#x003C; all &#x003E; enter by one gate<sup><xref rid="fn946">27</xref></sup> because of the evil eye?<sup><xref rid="fn947">28</xref></sup> And so they did. When they entered, they did not all enter as a unit, but each and every one all by himself. What did Joseph do? He posted guards over the entrance gates of Egypt. He said: Let each and every one who enters have his name and the name of his father written under your supervision. Then you are to bring their names to me. So, when the children of Jacob entered, each and every one all by himself, he (a guard) said: What is your name? So he told him: Reuben ben Jacob. And so it was with each and every one of them. &#x003C; A guard &#x003E; would write down his name and the name of his father. Then they brought &#x003C; the names &#x003E; to Joseph. Joseph immediately recognized them, as stated (in Gen. 42:8): <small>SO JOSEPH RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHERS</small>. He began to recall the dreams, as stated (in Gen. 42:9): <small>NOW JOSEPH REMEMBERED THE DREAMS THAT HE HAD DREAMED ABOUT THEM</small>. (Vs. 7:) <small>BUT HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM, AND HE SPOKE HARSHLY WITH THEM</small>. He began to treat them harshly, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE SAID TO THEM: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM</small>? When they said: From the land of Canaan, he said to Simeon and Levi: Are you accustomed to pillaging people just as you did at Shechem (in Gen. 34:25-26)? Ergo (in Gen. 42:7): <small>AND HE SPOKE HARSHLY WITH THEM</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 42:8:) <small>SO JOSEPH RECOGNIZED HIS BROTHERS</small>, when they fell into his hands. (Gen. 42:8, cont.:) <small>BUT THEY DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn948">29</xref></sup> when he had fallen into their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn949">30</xref></sup> David said (in Ps. 80:2 [1]): <small>GIVE EAR, O SHEPHERD OF ISRAEL, WHO LEADS JOSEPH LIKE A FLOCK</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn950">31</xref></sup> Thus has R. Tanhuma expounded (on Gen. 42:2): <small>GO DOWN THERE (<italic>RDW</italic>)</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E; that he saw that they would go down and be enslaved in Egypt for two hundred and ten (i.e., the numerical value of <italic>RDW</italic>) years.<sup><xref rid="fn951">32</xref></sup> Another interpretation of <small>GO DOWN</small>. &#x003C; These words are &#x003E; to teach you that anyone who buys produce from the marketplace has a going down (in status).<sup><xref rid="fn952">33</xref></sup> (Gen. 42:3:) <small>SO JOSEPH&#x2019;S TEN BROTHERS WENT DOWN</small>. &#x201C;The children of Israel&#x201D; is not written here but <small>JOSEPH&#x2019;S &#x003C; TEN &#x003E; BROTHERS</small>. &#x003C; It is so written &#x003E; because at the beginning they had not treated him with brotherhood, in that they had sold him. Then they had finally repented and said: When shall we go down to Egypt and return Joseph to our father? So, when their father told them to go down to Egypt, they all went with one mind to return him. It is therefore written (in Gen. 42:3): <small>SO JOSEPH&#x2019;S &#x003C; TEN &#x003E; BROTHERS WENT DOWN</small>. And why ten? Because it was up to them to end the divine punishment and annul the decree (of Gen. 15:13). You therefore find in the case of Sodom that Abraham went down from fifty &#x003C; righteous &#x003E; to ten.<sup><xref rid="fn953">34</xref></sup> When he did not find ten, Abraham the Righteous was silent. Moreover, because there were not ten &#x003C; righteous &#x003E; in the generation of the flood, they were not saved. Indeed, there were none there except Noah, his three sons, and their wives, i.e., eight.</p>
<title>10.11 Genesis 43:14ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND</small><sup><xref rid="fn954">35</xref></sup> <small>MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many <italic>Tefillot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn955">36</xref></sup> is one obligated to pray in a day?<sup><xref rid="fn956">37</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: One does not pray more than the three <italic>Tefillot</italic> which the ancestors of the world instituted.<sup><xref rid="fn957">38</xref></sup> Abraham instituted the morning <italic>Tefillah</italic>, as stated (in Gen. 19:27): <small>NOW ABRAHAM WENT EARLY IN THE MORNING UNTO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD STOOD (&#x2018;<italic>MD</italic>) BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Isaac instituted the <italic>Tefillah</italic> of the <italic>minhah</italic> (the <italic>Tefillah</italic> in the afternoon), as stated (in Gen. 24:63): <small>NOW ISAAC WENT OUT TO BOW DOWN (rt.: <italic>SWH</italic>) IN THE FIELD TOWARD EVENING</small>. Jacob instituted the evening <italic>Tefillah</italic>, as stated (in Gen. 28:11): <small>WHEN HE CAME (rt.: <italic>PG</italic>&#x2018;)<sup><xref rid="fn958">39</xref></sup> TO A CERTAIN PLACE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn959">40</xref></sup> Now it is also written about Daniel (in Dan. 6:11): <small>AND THREE TIMES A DAY [HE KNELT ON HIS KNEES]</small>. But &#x003C; the text &#x003E; did not explain at what hour. David came and explained (in Ps. 55:18 [17]): <small>EVENING, MORNING, AND NOON &#x003C; I COMPLAIN AND MOAN; AND HE HEARS MY VOICE &#x003E;</small>. Therefore, one is not authorized to pray more than three <italic>Tefillot</italic> in a day.<sup><xref rid="fn960">41</xref></sup> But R. Johanan said: And would that one might go on praying all day long&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn961">42</xref></sup> Antoninus asked Our Holy Rabbi: Is it permitted to pray at every hour? He said to him: It is forbidden. He said to him: Why? He said to him: Lest you treat the Most High with frivolity. He did not accept &#x003C; this answer &#x003E; from him. What did he do? He went to him early in the morning. He said to him: Greetings, Lord.<sup><xref rid="fn962">43</xref></sup> An hour later he came in to him. He said to him: &#x007B;&#x2019;<italic>MNH RTWQ</italic>&#x007D; [Imperator]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn963">44</xref></sup> An hour later he &#x003C; again &#x003E; said to him: <italic>Shalom</italic> to you, O King. He said to him: Why are you being disrespectful to the monarchy? He said to him: Let your ears hear what you are putting forth from your mouth. If you, who are flesh and blood, say this in the case of someone who asks after you every hour, how much the more so in the case of one who is disrespectful to the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. Thus one should not bother him all the time.</p>
<p>R. Jose ben Halafta says: There are times for the <italic>Tefillah</italic>, as stated (in Ps. 69:14 [13]): <small>BUT AS FOR ME, LET MY <italic>TEFILLAH</italic> COME TO YOU LORD AT AN ACCEPTABLE TIME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn964">45</xref></sup> When is an acceptable time? When the community prays. One must therefore arise early for the <italic>Tefillah</italic> since you have nothing greater than the <italic>Tefillah</italic>. So look at Moses. It was decreed against him that he not enter the land and that &#x003C; he was &#x003E; not to see it. But, because he was frequent in prayer (<italic>tefillah</italic>), (according Deut. 34:1): <small>THE LORD SHOWED HIM THE WHOLE LAND</small>&#x2026;. And thus did Hezekiah pray and annul the decree &#x003C; of death against himself &#x003E; (in I Kings 20:1-11). So also Jacob, when he sent his sons to Egypt, prayed over them (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.</p>
<title>10.12 Genesis 43:14ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>ShDY</italic>) GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.] What was the reason for Jacob to bless them with &#x003C; the formula &#x003E; <small>GOD <italic>ShDY</italic></small>?<sup><xref rid="fn965">46</xref></sup> To teach you that a lot of afflictions had come upon him. While he was in his mother&#x2019;s womb, Esau had contended with him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED TOGETHER WITHIN HER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn966">47</xref></sup> And so it says (in Amos 1:11): <small>BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD AND DESTROYED HIS WOMB</small>. &#x201C;His womb&#x201D; is &#x003C; what is &#x003E; written.<sup><xref rid="fn967">48</xref></sup> Because of Esau he fled to Laban. See how many troubles there were&#x0021; (Gen. 31:40:) <small>THUS I WAS: BY DAY SCORCHING HEAT CONSUMED ME</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; Look at &#x003E; how, when he left, &#x003C; Laban &#x003E; pursued after him to kill him, [as stated (in Gen. 31:23)]: <small>AND PURSUED AFTER HIM FOR A JOURNEY OF &#x007B;THREE&#x007D; [SEVEN] DAYS</small>. He escaped from him; Esau came with the intention of killing him. On account of him he lost all that gift<sup><xref rid="fn968">49</xref></sup> (according to Gen. 32:15 [14]): <small>TWO HUNDRED SHE-GOATS</small>&#x2026;. He went away from Esau; the trouble about Dinah came (in Gen. 34). Then after that, the trouble with Rachel &#x003C; dying &#x003E; (in Gen. 35:19). Then, after these troubles, he was intending to rest a bit, until there came the trouble about Joseph (in Gen. 37); and after that, the trouble with his father, Isaac, who died (in Gen. 35:29) ten years after the sale of Joseph. So the Scripture has cried out (in Job 3:26): <small>I WAS NOT TRANQUIL, NOT QUIET, HAD NO REST; AND TROUBLE CAME</small>. After that there came upon him the trouble with Simeon (in Gen. 42:24); and after that, the trouble with Benjamin (in Gen. 42:36; 43:3-15). He therefore prayed (in Genesis 43:14) <small>AND MAY GOD <italic>ShDY</italic></small>. Now he says: The one who said: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>), to the heavens and to the earth should say: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>), to my afflictions. For, when the Holy One created the heavens and the earth, they continued expanding until the Holy One said to them: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn969">50</xref></sup> It is therefore written (in Gen. 43:14): <small>GOD WHO IS ENOUGH (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>.</p>
<title>10.13 Genesis 43:14ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Gen. 43:29:) <small>THEN HE (Joseph) RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>. He was happy that he was like his mother, for it is so written: <small>THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>. Immediately (in Gen. 44:1): <small>THEN HE COMMANDED THE ONE WHO WAS OVER HIS HOUSE, SAYING: FILL THE MEN&#x2019;S SACKS WITH FOOD</small>&#x2026;. He said to Manasseh<sup><xref rid="fn970">51</xref></sup> (in Gen. 44:1-3): <small>FILL THE SACKS &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; AND &#x003C; YOU SHALL PUT &#x003E; MY GOBLET, THE GOBLET OF SILVER, &#x003C; IN THE MOUTH OF THE SACK OF THE YOUNGEST &#x003E;&#x2026;. AT MORNING LIGHT THE MEN WERE SENT OFF</small>. Why did he not send them away at night? Joseph said: If I send them away at night, there is no creature who could cope with them because they are like wild beasts. (In Gen. 49:9:) <small>JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>, (in Deut. 33:22): <small>DAN IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>, (in Gen. 49:17): <small>DAN SHALL BE A SERPENT</small>, (in Gen. 49:21): <small>NAPHTALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE</small>, (and in Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:4:) <small>THEY HAD LEFT THE CITY AND HAD NOT GONE FAR</small>. Joseph said: If they go far, there is no creature able to return them.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>ARISE, GO AFTER THE MEN</small>; for as long as the fear of a &#x007B;knee&#x007D; [city]<sup><xref rid="fn971">52</xref></sup> is over them.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND, WHEN YOU OVERTAKE THEM</small>. See, he is confounding them with words, now harshly and now gently.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:5, 13:) <small>IS NOT THIS THE ONE FROM WHICH MY LORD DRINKS &#x2026; ? SO THEY RENT THEIR CLOTHES</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to them: You caused your father&#x2019;s clothes to be rent for nothing (in Gen. 37:34); so you are rending &#x003C; your clothes &#x003E; for nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn972">53</xref></sup> (Gen. 44:5, cont.:) <small>THEN EACH ONE LOADED HIS ASS</small>. Not one of them was required for his ass.<sup><xref rid="fn973">54</xref></sup> So they arose and, striking Benjamin on his shoulder, said to him: Oh you thief, you son of a thief, you have shamed me&#x0021; You are your mother&#x2019;s son. Thus did she &#x007B;your mother&#x007D; shame our father (according to Gen. 31:19): <small>AND RACHEL STOLE THE HOUSEHOLD GODS &#x003C; OF HER FATHER &#x003E;</small>. By virtue of these blows with which they smote him on his shoulders, he was worthy of having the Divine Presence rest on his shoulders. It is so stated (of Benjamin in Deut. 33:12): <small>AND HE (the Lord) DWELLS BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:14:) <small>WHEN JUDAH AND HIS BROTHERS CAME TO JOSEPH&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO JOSEPH&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>? Did not he not leave &#x003C; his house &#x003E; daily to hold court at the seat of judgment?<sup><xref rid="fn974">55</xref></sup> It is simply that on this day he did not leave &#x003C; home &#x003E; so as not to shame his brothers before the Egyptians.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY FELL TO THE GROUND BEFORE HIM</small> to fulfill that which was stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:15:) <small>THEN JOSEPH SAID TO THEM: WHAT IS THIS DEED THAT YOU HAVE DONE</small>? Joseph said to them: I am telling you for what reason this lad stole it. &#x003C; He did so &#x003E; to divine with it and to know where his brother was.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:16:) <small>BUT JUDAH SAID: WHAT SHALL WE SAY TO MY LORD</small>? What shall we say about the former money? And what shall we speak about the second money? How shall we justify ourselves over the goblet?</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>GOD HAS FOUND OUT THE CRIME OF YOUR SERVANTS</small>. Do not read: &#x201C;He has found out&#x201D; but: &#x201C;He has caused &#x003C; others &#x003E; to find out.&#x201D; Two &#x003C; of us &#x003E; brothers never enter a banquet hall together because of the &#x003C; evil &#x003E; eye. Now all of us find ourselves in a single garden bed through a single offense which took place at our hands. He said to them: This brother of yours was not with you at that time. They said to him: Everything found with the thief is seized with him. He said to them: But, if in the case of your former brother, who neither stole nor caused you grief, you said (in Gen. 37:33 // 44:28): <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>; how much the more &#x003C; are these words applicable &#x003E; in the case of this one who has stolen and caused you grief&#x0021; Go, say to his father: <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>. Now are not &#x003C; these &#x003E; words an argument a fortiori? And, if an unfortunate incident which came about through righteous ones (like Joseph) has been sustaining the whole world,<sup><xref rid="fn975">56</xref></sup> how much the more so in the case of merit which the Holy One brings about through them&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn976">57</xref></sup></p>
<title>10.14 Genesis 43:14ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>. Let our master instruct us: Where have they ordained that one says a blessing over the food? Where it is stated (in Deut. 8:10): <small>THEN YOU SHALL EAT, BE FULL, AND BLESS</small>. So much for after &#x003C; the meal &#x003E;. Where &#x003C; is it ordained for &#x003E; before the meal? R. Hiyya taught in the name of R. Aqiva:<sup><xref rid="fn977">58</xref></sup> (according to Lev. 19:24:) <small>&#x003C; ALL ITS FRUIT SHALL BE &#x003E; SET ASIDE FOR PRAISES TO THE LORD</small>. &#x003C; These words &#x003E; teach that one needs a blessing before &#x003C; a meal &#x003E; and after it (since <small>PRAISES</small> is plural). The Holy One said: Just as I need to bring down rain, cause winds to blow, and bring down dews; so you need to bless me and be strictly observant in praying to me.<sup><xref rid="fn978">59</xref></sup> Do not see yourself in the time of prosperity despising prayer.<sup><xref rid="fn979">60</xref></sup> Then, when trouble arrives, you would stand up and pray&#x0021; No, my child, do not do this; but, before trouble comes, you should pray ahead of time, as stated (in Job 36:19): <small>WILL YOUR CRY FOR HELP BE MAKE READY WHEN THERE IS NO TROUBLE, AND ALL YOUR POWERFUL FORCES</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn980">61</xref></sup> You know that in the case of our father Jacob, when Benjamin was with him and he did not know what was going to happen to him, he began to pray ahead of time. It is so stated (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN THAT HE MAY RELEASE TO YOU YOUR OTHER BROTHER AND BENJAMIN</small>. And so the proverb says (in Ecclesiasticus 38:1): <small>HONOR THE PHYSICIAN BEFORE YOU HAVE NEED OF HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn981">62</xref></sup> What is the meaning of (Job 36:19): <small>ALONG WITH ALL YOUR POWERFUL FORCES</small>? That &#x003C; those who pray ahead of time &#x003E; in this way have made <small>POWERFUL FORCES</small>.</p>

Ishmael] said: One should pray in anticipation of the departure of the soul, for there is nothing harder than the departure of the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn983">64</xref></sup> How does it pass away? R. Johanan said: It is like the <italic>pittore</italic> which passes out through the opening of a <italic>weshet</italic> &#x007B;i.e., the rope when one is drawing it through a &#x003C; hawse &#x003E; hole in a ship to tie it up with it&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn984">65</xref></sup> So is the soul when it leaves (<italic>yots&#x2019;ah</italic>) a person. Thus a person must not trust in himself until the day of his death; and so have our masters taught (in <italic>Avot</italic> 2:4): <small>DO NOT TRUST [IN YOURSELF] UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn985">66</xref></sup> Once upon a time there was a certain man, a sectarian (<italic>min</italic>) whose master would teach him and say: <small>DO NOT TRUST IN YOURSELF UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>. But he took issue with the words of his master. The Holy One said: This one has come to take issue with the Torah. What did he do to him? He tempted him. Now he went out on the Day of Atonement into a certain garden and saw a certain young woman, who was beautifully and tastefully adorned. There she stood before him, and he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. He talked with her. She said to him: I am someone&#x2019;s wife. He said to her: That&#x2019;s all right. She said to him: I am the wife of a priest. He said to her: That&#x2019;s all right. She said to him: I am menstruating. He said to her: That&#x2019;s all right. And he did not move until he had had sexual intercourse with her. He went home and sat <italic>olophyzon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn986">67</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., distressed&#x007D;, thinking about what had come over him. Then his masters came up to visit him, and month after month they found him like someone who was sick, saying: What have I done? Yet he was not sick. What did the Holy One do? He said: How long will he grieve? The Holy One nodded to the same female demon (<italic>shedah</italic>). So she came and stood before him. She said to him: How long will you grieve? I am that woman with whom you had sexual intercourse. I am a spirit. &#x003C; It happened &#x003E; simply because you differed with the words of the sages who have said (in <italic>Avot</italic> 2:4): <small>DO NOT TRUST IN YOURSELF UNTIL THE DAY OF YOUR DEATH</small>. David also has agreed, saying: One must pray concerning the departure of his soul. He therefore said (in Ps. 32:6): <small>&#x003C; THEREFORE LET EVERY SAINT PRAY UNTO YOU &#x003E; IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small> (i.e., in anticipation of the time of departure).</p>
<p>[Another interpretation: <small>IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small>.] &#x003C; It means &#x003E; that someone had to be hoping for something until he knew his end. Who was this? This was Jacob. Although he said (in Gen. 37:33 // 44:28): <small>HE HAS BEEN TORN TO BITS</small>, he was waiting for the Holy One. In the end he informed him that Joseph was alive. And not only that, but he &#x003C; himself &#x003E; brought him the good news that he was alive. (Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn987">68</xref></sup></p>
<title>10.16 Genesis 43:14ff., Part VI</title>
<p>[(Gen. 43:14:) <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 94:12): <small>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU CHASTISE, O LORD</small>. How is the man blessed? R. Joshua said: If chastisements come upon you, you shall &#x003C; still &#x003E; be able to labor in the Torah. These are chastisements of love. But, if you are not able to labor in the Torah, they are chastisements of punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn988">69</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>BLESSED IS THE MAN WHOM YOU CHASTISE, O LORD; HIM YOU INSTRUCT FROM YOUR TORAH</small>. R. Bisna said: There is no one in the world who does not come into the hands of chastisements. Here is a person who feels pain in his eyes &#x003C; and &#x003E; cannot sleep. &#x003C; Or he feels pain &#x003E; in his teeth and cannot sleep. Instead he is awake the whole night. But someone &#x003C; else &#x003E; is awake the whole night to labor in the Torah. The one is awake, and the other is awake. Ergo: Blessed is a person when his chastisements are in the Torah.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn989">70</xref></sup> R. Alexandri said: Blessed is the man upon whom chastisements come.<sup><xref rid="fn990">71</xref></sup> Then the Holy One says to them: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>) for you, because (<italic>Sh</italic>) there is an end to them. Who was this man? This was Jacob when he said to his children: <small>GOD <italic>ShDY</italic></small>. May God say to my chastisements: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>) for you. Ergo: <small>GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>. R. Aha said: These heavens were created from a curtain material, and the earth was created from snow.<sup><xref rid="fn991">72</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Is. 40:22): <small>WHO HAS STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN</small>. And the earth &#x003C; comes &#x003E; from snow, as stated (in Job 37:6): <small>FOR TO THE SNOW HE SAYS: BECOME EARTH</small>. When the Holy One told them to be created, they continued to expand. R. Aha said: If the Holy One had not told them: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>), they would have continued to expand until they were raised along with the dead. Jacob said: The one who said to the heavens and earth: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>) for you, should say to my afflictions: Enough (<italic>DY</italic>) for you. (Gen. 43:14:) <small>GOD WHO IS ENOUGH (<italic>ShDY</italic>)</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. What is the meaning of this word (<small>ALMIGHTY</small>)? That <small>GOD ALMIGHTY</small> is strong (<italic>qasheh</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn992">73</xref></sup> and, if you do his will, behold, he becomes fulfilled for you. Why? Because he is strong (<italic>qasheh</italic>) in his mercy. Therefore (ibid.): <small>&#x003C; AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY &#x003E; GRANT YOU MERCY</small>.</p>
<title>10.17 Genesis 43:14ff., Part VII</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Gen. 42:3)? <small>SO JOSEPH&#x2019;S TEN BROTHERS WENT DOWN</small>. When they went down to Egypt, Joseph cunningly issued three <italic>prostagmata</italic><sup><xref rid="fn993">74</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., writs&#x007D;:</p>
<ol>
<li>That no slave should enter Egypt to buy grain,</li>
<li>That no one person should walk behind two donkeys, and</li>
<li>That no one should enter until he had written down his name, his father&#x2019;s name, and his grandfather&#x2019;s name.<sup><xref rid="fn994">75</xref></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>What did Joseph do? He commanded them to bring to him the names of the people which were written down on each and every day. They came in on the first day and brought him the names of those who had entered &#x003C; the country &#x003E;, and so they informed him on each and every day. When Joseph&#x2019;s brothers came down, they all did not enter through one gate.<sup><xref rid="fn995">76</xref></sup> The gatekeeper said to &#x003C; one of the brothers &#x003E;: What is your name? He told him: Reuben ben Jacob ben Isaac. So it was also with Simeon, and so with all of them. They brought &#x003C; the names &#x003E; that had been written down to Joseph. When he read them, he knew that his brothers were there. He sent for his son, Manasseh. He said: See where they are going. Manasseh went and saw them going about in the marketplace. They went from this marketplace to that marketplace, from this alley to that alley. &#x003C; Then Joseph &#x003E; sent after them, and they came to him. When he saw them, he certainly recognized them, <small>BUT</small> (according to Gen. 42:7) <small>HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUT HE BECAME A STRANGER UNTO THEM</small>. R. Johanan said: He became a foreigner to them. (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM</small>? He said to them (in vs. 9): <small>YOU ARE SPIES</small>. They said to him (in vs. 10, 13): <small>NO, MY LORD, BUT YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME TO BUY FOOD &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. WE, YOUR SERVANTS ARE TWELVE BROTHERS</small>. R. Johanan &#x003C; drew on an Aramaic metaphor and &#x003E; said: &#x003C; The matter &#x003E; is comparable to a raven who brought fire into its nest &#x007B;i.e., a raven who brought fire into its nest&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn996">77</xref></sup> He said to them: Are you brothers? They told him: Yes. Then why did you not all enter by one gate? Because our father ordered us &#x003C; not to do &#x003E; so because of the &#x003C; evil &#x003E; eye. He said to them (in vs. 16): <small>BY PHARAOH&#x2019;S LIFE YOU ARE SURELY SPIES</small>. When &#x003C; Joseph &#x003E; swore falsely, he swore by Pharaoh&#x2019;s head.<sup><xref rid="fn997">78</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a woman who stole a lamb from the flock and fled. When the shepherd ran after her, she went home and covered it with a garment. The shepherd said to her: Have you seen a lamb? She said to him: May I eat of the flesh of this one lying on the bed, if I know anything &#x003C; about it &#x003E; &#x0021; So &#x003C; it was with &#x003E; Joseph. When he wanted to swear falsely, he swore by Pharaoh&#x2019;s life. (Gen. 42:10:) <small>THEY SAID UNTO HIM: NO, MY LORD, BUT YOUR SERVANTS HAVE COME TO BUY FOOD</small>. He said to them: You know that you are spies. Why have you gone and made the rounds of the whole country? They said to him: We had a brother, but we sold him as a slave. And from the hour that we sold him our father has sat around mourning over him. So we have come down &#x003C; here &#x003E; with money in our hands, saying: Wherever we find him, we will redeem him. He said to them: Can a person who sells something go back on it? They said to him: For this reason we came down with double &#x003C; the money &#x003E; on hand to redeem him. He said to them: What if &#x003C; his owner &#x003E; does not want to sell him? They said to him: Even though we are burned &#x003C; alive &#x003E; on his account, we will not move until we have redeemed him. He said to them (in Gen. 42:14): <small>IT IS AS I SAID UNTO YOU: YOU ARE SPIES</small>. What did he do (according to vs. 24)? <small>THEN HE TOOK SIMEON FROM THEM &#x003C; AND BOUND HIM BEFORE THEIR EYES &#x003E;</small>. He (Joseph) said &#x003C; to himself &#x003E;: He bound me and cast me into the pit; I also am binding him. What did they do? They loaded up, went to their father, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 29) <small>RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM</small>. He said to them (in Gen. 43:2): <small>GO AND BUY US A LITTLE FOOD</small>. Judah said to him (in vs. 3): <small>THE MAN SOLEMNLY WARNED US, SAYING: YOU SHALL NOT SEE MY FACE &#x003C; UNLESS YOUR BROTHER IS WITH YOU &#x003E;</small>. He said to them: I will not send Benjamin even though I am killed. They said to him: It is better for you to lose one life and not seventy. What did he do? He gave them Benjamin and began to pray for them (in Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY GRANT YOU MERCY BEFORE THE MAN</small>, seeing that (according to Gen. 42:30): <small>THE MAN &#x003C; THE LORD OF THE LAND &#x003E; SPOKE &#x003C; &#x2026;HARSHLY &#x003E;</small>. He therefore said (in Gen. 43:14): <small>BEFORE THE MAN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn998">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 43:14): <small>AND MAY GOD ALMIGHTY</small>. &#x003C; These words &#x003E; speak about Israel and about their captivity. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>GRANT YOU MERCY</small>. (Ps. 106:46:) <small>AND HE DID GRANT THEM MERCY BEFORE ALL THEIR CAPTORS</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>THAT HE MAY RELEASE (<italic>ShLH</italic>) TO YOU</small>. (Mal. 3:23 [4:5]:) <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING (<italic>ShLH</italic>) YOU &#x003C; THE PROPHET ELIJAH BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 43:14, cont.:) <small>YOUR BROTHERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn999">80</xref></sup> &#x003C; These are the brothers &#x003E; who are beyond the Sambatyon River.<sup><xref rid="fn1000">81</xref></sup></p>

<title>11.1 Genesis 44:18ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 44:18:) <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Eccl. 9:14-15): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT; &#x003C; AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT, BESIEGED IT, AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT &#x003E;. NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A [POOR WISE] PERSON &#x007B;WHO WAS POOR AND WISE&#x007D;, &#x003C; WHO MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM; BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT POOR PERSON &#x003E;</small>. What does it mean?<sup><xref rid="fn1001">1</xref></sup> This verse is stated about all generations. <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY</small>, i.e., the body; <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>, i.e., the two hundred and forty-eight members [which are in a person]; <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT</small>, i.e., the evil drive, which is bigger than the good drive, &#x003C; i.e., older &#x003E; by thirteen years and one day. Now the evil drive says: Let us eat, drink, and fulfill all our desires; but the good drive says: Let us not eat and drink, but be occupied with Torah. Then we heed the evil drive. Why? Because it is bigger than all of them. (Eccl. 9:14, cont.:) <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>, i.e., sins and transgressions. (Eccl. 9:15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A PERSON WHO WAS POOR AND WISE</small>, i.e., the good drive; <small>WHO MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn1002">2</xref></sup> <small>BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT POOR PERSON</small>, for no one heeds the good drive, because it is insignificant. So, whoever heeds the good drive is blessed, as stated (in Ps. 41:2 [1]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO PAYS HEED TO A POOR PERSON</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1003">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:14-15): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY</small>, i.e., the world;<sup><xref rid="fn1004">4</xref></sup> <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>, i.e., the generation of the flood; <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT</small>, i.e., the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One; <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>, as stated (in Gen. 6:13): <small>BEHOLD, I AM DESTROYING THEM WITH THE EARTH</small>. (Eccl. 9:14-15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A PERSON WHO WAS POOR AND WISE</small>, i.e., Noah; <small>WHO MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>. (Gen. 7:1:) <small>COME YOU AND ALL YOUR HOUSE INTO THE ARK</small>. (Eccl. 9:15, cont.:) <small>BUT NO ONE THOUGHT (<italic>ZKR</italic>) ABOUT THAT POOR PERSON</small>. The Holy One said: No one remembered (<italic>ZKR</italic>) him, but I am remembering (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) him, as stated (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) NOAH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:14): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY</small>, i.e., the desert; <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>, i.e., the generation of the desert; <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT</small>, i.e., the Holy One; <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>. When? When Israel made the calf. What is written (in Deut. 9:14)? <small>LET ME ALONE, AND I WILL DESTROY THEM</small>. (Eccl. 9:15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A PERSON WHO WAS POOR AND WISE</small>, i.e., Moses the Righteous, as stated (in Prov. 21:22): <small>A WISE ONE WENT UP TO A CITY OF WARRIORS</small>. (Eccl. 9:15, cont.:) <small>WHO DELIVERED</small><sup><xref rid="fn1005">5</xref></sup> <small>THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:11): <small>&#x003C; BUT MOSES IMPLORED THE LORD HIS GOD AND SAID &#x003E;: WHY DOES YOUR WRATH BURN AGAINST YOUR PEOPLE</small>? (Eccl. 9:15, cont.:) <small>BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT (<italic>ZKR</italic>) THAT POOR PERSON</small>. The Holy One said: If no one has remembered (<italic>ZKR</italic>) him, I am remembering (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) him, as stated (in Is. 63:11): <small>THEN HE REMEMBERED (rt.: <italic>ZKR</italic>) THE DAYS OF OLD: &#x003C; THOSE OF &#x003E; MOSES, &#x007B;HIS SERVANT&#x007D; [&#x003C; THOSE OF &#x003E; HIS PEOPLE]</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:14-15): <small>THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY</small>, i.e., Egypt;<sup><xref rid="fn1006">6</xref></sup> <small>WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT</small>, i.e., Joseph&#x2019;s brothers; <small>AND A GREAT KING CAME OVER IT</small>, i.e., Joseph; <small>AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT</small>. (Thus in Gen. 42:9:) <small>SO HE SAID TO THEM: YOU ARE SPIES</small>. (Eccl. 9:15:) <small>NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A PERSON WHO WAS POOR AND WISE</small>, i.e., Judah; <small>WHO DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM</small>. (Gen. 44:18:) <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>11.2 Genesis 44:18ff., Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 20:5): <small>THE COUNSEL IN ONE&#x2019;S HEART IS DEEP WATER, BUT ONE WITH UNDERSTANDING SHALL DRAW IT OUT. THE COUNSEL IN ONE&#x2019;S HEART IS DEEP WATER</small>: This refers to Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">7</xref></sup> However wise Joseph was, Judah came and vanquished him, as stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH PRESSED AGAINST HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1008">8</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a cistern which was so deep that no one was able to go down in it. There came one who was astute &#x003C; enough &#x003E; to bring a long rope. So he reached his water and drew &#x003C; some &#x003E; out of it. Thus Joseph was deep, but Judah came and drew out of him.</p>
<title>11.3 Genesis 44:18ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. This text is related (to Job 41:8 [16]): <small>ONE IS SO NEAR TO THE OTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM</small>. This refers to Judah and Joseph, for in whatever Joseph prided himself, Judah came and vanquished, as stated (in Gen. 45:1): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF</small>. To what were they comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn1009">9</xref></sup> To a bull that went out; and, when all the beasts fled from him, he kicked (rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;T</italic>) at one and gored at another. Then came the lion, but he did not stand up to him. Rather, when the lion appeared and sought out the bull, he was not to be found. So Joseph is likened to the bull, as stated (in Deut. 33:17): <small>LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY</small>. The tribes also have been likened to beasts, and Joseph was priding himself as being over them and despising (rt.: <italic>B&#x2018;T</italic>) them. (According to Gen. 42:7) <small>HE BECAME A STRANGER TO THEM</small>. Then goring at a particular one, (according to Gen. 42:24) <small>HE TOOK SIMON FROM THEM</small>. He acted so only until the lion came, &#x003C; for &#x003E; (according to Gen. 49:24) <small>JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>. He sought him out as the bull, but he was not to be found. Rather (according to Gen. 45:1): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF</small>. Why? (Prov. 30:30:) <small>THE LION IS THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THE BEASTS, AND RETREATS BEFORE NONE</small>, even because it is written of him (in Gen. 47:12): <small>AND &#x003C; JOSEPH &#x003E; SUSTAINED &#x003C; HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">10</xref></sup> Also in the world to come a fighting Messiah is going to arise from Joseph, but a Messiah who is to arise from Judah will be stronger than he, as stated (in Zech. 10:6): <small>I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH, &#x003C; BUT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH I WILL SAVE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>11.4 Genesis 44:18ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 6:1-3): <small>MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR&#x2026;. YOU ARE ENSNARED IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH&#x2026;. DO THIS, THEN, MY SON, AND SAVE YOURSELF, &#x003C; FOR YOU HAVE COME INTO THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR. GO HUMBLE YOURSELF, AND URGE YOUR NEIGHBOR &#x003E;</small>. Joseph said to &#x003C; Judah &#x003E;: Why are you multiplying words? I see that people older than you are standing here without speaking. And is not Reuben older than you? Is not Simeon also older than you? Yet none of them are speaking. But in your case, why are you multiplying words? &#x003C; Judah &#x003E; said to him: Of all these people, not one of them is anxious about &#x003C; Benjamin &#x003E; except me alone because I stood surety &#x003C; for him &#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): <small>I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM</small>. Now I said this to my father, that, if I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I am sinning before you in two worlds, in this world and in the world to come, as stated (in Gen. 44:32): <small>I AM GUILTY BEFORE MY FATHER FOREVER</small>. I therefore give my life for him. Why? (Prov. 6:1, 3:) <small>MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR &#x2026; &#x003C; SAVE YOURSELF, FOR YOU HAVE COME UNDER THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>11.5 Genesis 44:18ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM AND SAID: PRAY (<italic>bi</italic>), MY LORD, PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK</small>. He said to him: You are bringing injustice (<italic>biyah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1011">11</xref></sup> upon us.<sup><xref rid="fn1012">12</xref></sup> Why? Because you said to us (in Gen. 42:18): <small>DO THIS AND LIVE; FOR I FEAR GOD</small>. You are not fearful of the Holy One. Rather you are like Pharaoh, as stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>FOR YOU ARE LIKE PHARAOH</small>. Ergo: You are bringing injustice upon us. He said to him: You are judging neither by the royal law nor by divine law. Under divine law one who is found stealing pays twofold, as stated (in Exod. 22:6 [7]): <small>IF THE THIEF IS FOUND HE SHALL PAY DOUBLE</small>. If he does not have the wherewithal to pay, he shall be sold for his theft. Under royal law one takes everything he has. If you are seizing us under royal law, take for yourself whatever we have on hand; but, if under divine law, if we cannot pay his price, here we are for you as slaves. (Gen. 44:18:) <small>PRAY (<italic>bi</italic>), MY LORD</small>, you are bringing injustice (<italic>biyah</italic>) upon us.</p>
<title>11.6 Genesis 44:18ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY (<italic>bi</italic>), MY LORD</small>. By universal custom one who buys a slave and finds him to be a thief returns him. But, in the case of this person (Benjamin) who was found to be a thief, you want to acquire him as a slave&#x0021; You are suspected of evil things. If you want him to serve you, I know how to serve better than he. If you want him for war, I know how to fight better than he. (Gen. 44:33:) <small>PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD</small>. (Gen. 44:18:) <small>PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK SOMETHING</small>. R. Jeremiah ben Shema&#x2018;yah has said: He told him: If I make my voice heard, a plague will come over Egypt. <small>PLEASE LET &#x003C; YOUR SERVANT &#x003E; SPEAK. PLEASE (<italic>N</italic>&#x2019;)</small> denotes nothing but Egypt. Thus it is stated (in Nahum 3:8): <small>WERE YOU (Nineveh) ANY BETTER THAN NO-AMON (<italic>N&#x2019;-&#x2019;MWN</italic>)</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1013">13</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C; WHICH SITS BY THE NILE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:18, cont.:) <small>IN THE EARS OF MY LORD</small>. He said to him: Let my words enter your ears. Two of us younger ones entered a great city and destroyed it, as stated (in Gen. 34:25): <small>THAT TWO OF JACOB&#x2019;S SONS &#x003C; EACH TOOK HIS SWORD &#x2026; AND KILLED EVERY MALE &#x003E;</small>. Now we are all here. If we want, we shall not leave a soul here.</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:18, cont.:) <small>FOR YOU ARE LIKE PHARAOH</small>. He said to him: Just as Pharaoh is the greatest here, and you are second to him; so Daddy is the greatest in the land of Canaan, and I am second to him. He said: I swear: If I should draw my sword from its scabbard, I am beginning with you, and I am winding up with Pharaoh. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 27:17): <small>IRON SHARPENS IRON</small>. It is fitting for the both of them to stand facing each other; it is fitting for a king to boast facing a king. Judah is a king, about whom it is written (in I Chron. 5:2): <small>JUDAH PREVAILED AMONG HIS BROTHERS</small>. Joseph is a king, about whom it is written (in Gen. 41:43): <small>HE LET HIM RIDE IN THE CHARIOT OF HIS DEPUTY</small>. Therefore, both of them were goring each other. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY (<italic>bi</italic>)</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1014">14</xref></sup> <small>MY LORD</small>.</p>
<title>11.7 Genesis 44:18ff., Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh&#x0021; Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): <small>NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD</small>. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &#x003C; it was that &#x003E; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">15</xref></sup> I did not touch it. Now &#x003C; I swear &#x003E; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): <small>ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph)</small>; nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): <small>THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC</small>; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): <small>AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT</small>; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &#x003C; By none of these do I swear &#x003E; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &#x003C; each one &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">16</xref></sup> He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): <small>BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD</small>. He said to him: Why Bela (<italic>BL</italic>&#x2018;)? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: <italic>BL</italic>&#x2018;) from me. Becher (<italic>BKR</italic>)? Because he was my mother&#x2019;s first-born (rt.: <italic>BKR</italic>). Ashbel (&#x2019;<italic>ShBL</italic>)? Because my brother was captured (<italic>NShBH</italic>). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (<italic>ger</italic>) with &#x003C; merely &#x003E; the privileges of a transient.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">17</xref></sup> Naaman (<italic>N&#x2018;M</italic>)? Because his words were pleasing (<italic>N&#x2018;M</italic>). Ehi (&#x2019;<italic>HY</italic>)? Because he was my brother (&#x2019;<italic>HY</italic>) from &#x003C; the same &#x003E; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means &#x201C;head&#x201D;)? Because he was older than I. Muppim (<italic>MPYM</italic>)? Because he learned Torah from our father&#x2019;s mouth (<italic>MPY</italic>) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: <italic>HPP</italic>)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: <italic>HPP</italic>) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (<italic>huppah</italic>) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: <italic>HPP</italic>): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: <italic>YHP</italic>). And Ard (&#x2019;<italic>RD</italic>)? Because he brought (rt.: <italic>YRD</italic>) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): <small>NO, I WILL GO DOWN (&#x2019;<italic>RD</italic>) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>. Will you please not bring down (&#x2019;<italic>RD</italic>) Daddy to Sheol through grief&#x0021; And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): <small>FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &#x003C; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &#x003E;</small>? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): <small>JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF&#x2026;. AND HE WEPT ALOUD&#x2026;. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH</small>. When he said to them: <small>I AM &#x007B;YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH&#x007D;</small> &#x2026; (in vs. 3, cont.): <small>HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM</small>. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah:<sup><xref rid="fn1018">18</xref></sup> Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &#x003C; his &#x003E; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): <small>FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &#x003C; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &#x003E;</small> &#x2026; &#x0021;</p>
<title>11.8 Genesis 44:18ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>. He drew near to fight with him. Now this language is nothing but the language of warfare. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 10:13): <small>SO JOAB AND &#x007B;ALL&#x007D; THE PEOPLE &#x003C; WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR TO THE BATTLE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">19</xref></sup> Our masters have said: When Judah was filled with wrath, his hairs<sup><xref rid="fn1020">20</xref></sup> would stand up and break through his garments. There are also those who say that he would take iron beans, put them in his mouth, and crunch them in it when his wrath would arise. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 44:18): <small>THEN &#x003C; JUDAH &#x003E; DREW NEAR &#x007B;AND SAID: PRAY (<italic>bi</italic>), MY LORD</small>, you are bringing injustice (<italic>biyah</italic>) upon us.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">21</xref></sup> Yesterday you told us: You shall bring your younger brother unto me; so we have brought him. Now you have taken him. Is this not injustice?&#x007D;</p>
<p>(Gen. 44:18:) <small>AND &#x003C; JUDAH &#x003E; SAID: PRAY, MY LORD&#x2026;. FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD</small>. When did Judah discharge his surety? In the days of Goliath. At that time, when Israel was in trouble, what is written (in I Sam. 17:16)? <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING</small>. &#x003C; He was &#x003E; cursing and reviling. Saul began sending out a herald &#x003C; to proclaim &#x003E; (as implied in I Sam. 17:25): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM THAT THE KING SHALL ENRICH HIM &#x003C; WITH GREAT RICHES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Now you find that anyone who curses is liable for death, as stated (in Lev. 24:16): <small>AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small> &#x2026; but that wicked man had been cursing (according to I Sam. 17:16): <small>FOR FORTY DAYS</small>. Moses said (in Deut. 7:10): <small>AND &#x003C; GOD &#x003E; INSTANTLY REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM WITH DESTRUCTION</small>. In the case of someone wicked who performs a righteous act, the Holy One renders it unfit &#x003C; by giving him his reward &#x003E; during his life in this world in order to destroy him in the world to come; but for the righteous, he sets aside their righteous acts for the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1022">22</xref></sup> What &#x003C; righteous act &#x003E; did this wicked man (i.e., Goliath) do for him to curse for forty days? R. Isaac and R. Levi differ.<sup><xref rid="fn1023">23</xref></sup> R. Levi said: Because his mother, Orpah (&#x2018;<italic>RPH</italic>), walked four miles<sup><xref rid="fn1024">24</xref></sup> with her mother-in-law (cf. Ruth 1:7, 14), [the Holy One repaid her for it]. So from her the Holy One raised four heroes. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 21:22): <small>THESE FOUR WERE BORN TO THE GIANT (<italic>HRPH</italic>) OF GATH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1025">25</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: She walked forty paces<sup><xref rid="fn1026">26</xref></sup> with her; therefore, the Holy One granted her her reward and gave her Goliath.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">27</xref></sup> So he was cursing before the Holy One forty days, as stated (in I Sam. 17:16): <small>AND HE (the Philistine) TOOK HIS STAND FOR FORTY DAYS</small>. Jesse said to his son David: Now is the time to make good on the surety of your ancestor who became surety for Benjamin under the hand of his father, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): <small>I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM</small>. Now go and discharge him from his surety. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 17:18): <small>SEE ALSO TO THE WELFARE OF YOUR BROTHERS, AND TAKE THEIR TOKEN</small>. Now <small>THEIR TOKEN (&#x2018;<italic>RBH</italic>)</small> is nothing but a surety (<italic>&#x2018;RBWT</italic>). What did David do? He went and made good on the surety by killing Goliath. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as you have risked your life for Saul, since he is from the tribe of Benjamin, even as your ancestor Judah did for Benjamin &#x003C; himself &#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 44:33): <small>AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD</small> &#x2026; so I am placing the Sanctuary &#x003C; both &#x003E; within your territory and within the territory of Benjamin. And where is it shown that the Sanctuary is &#x003C; both &#x003E; within the inheritance of Benjamin and within the inheritance of Judah? Where one text (Gen. 49:27) says: <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF; IN THE MORNING HE CONSUMES PREY</small>, i.e., the dawn <italic>tamid</italic> (sacrifice), <small>AND IN THE EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL</small>, i.e., the twilight <italic>tamid</italic>; while another text (Ps. 48:3 [2]) says: <small>BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &#x003C; EVEN MOUNT ZION &#x003E;</small>. By your life, moreover, when all the tribes are going into exile, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are not going into exile along with them. Why? Because these two tribes believed in me and sanctified my name in the sea with Moses. R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Levi: When the sea was split open for Israel, there was mire in it. Now the tribe of Reuben said to the tribe of Simeon: From mud you have come and to mud you are going. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 12:1): <small>EPHRAIM SURROUNDS ME WITH DECEIT, THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH FALSE-HOOD</small>&#x2026;. What did the tribes of Judah and Benjamin do? They sanctified the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 68:28 [27]): <small>LITTLE BENJAMIN IS THERE RULING OVER THEM, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH IN THEIR GLORY</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): <small>PRAY, MY LORD</small>. (Vs. 19:) <small>MY LORD ASKED</small>. It is also stated (in vs. 20): <small>UNTO MY LORD</small>. (Vs. 33:) <small>AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN &#x003C; AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">28</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Behold, you have now let go of your former power, and spoken supplications. By your life, in spite of what I said (in Hos. 12:3 [2]): <small>THE LORD HAS A LAWSUIT WITH JUDAH</small>, I will instead be gracious and have compassion on you. It is so stated (in Is. 57:16): <small>FOR I WILL NOT CARRY ON A LAWSUIT FOREVER</small>. And the <small>EVER (in FOREVER)</small> is nothing but a reference to Judah, since it is stated (in Joel 4:20 [3:20]): <small>BUT JUDAH SHALL BE INHABITED FOREVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">29</xref></sup></p>
<title>11.9 Genesis 46:28ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 46:28:) <small>NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH</small>. This text is related (to Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1030">30</xref></sup> Come and see how whatever the Holy One has smitten in this world is healed in the world to come. The blind are healed, as stated (in Is. 35:5): <small>THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED</small>. The lame also are healed, as stated (in vs. 6): <small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART</small>. And the dumb shall be healed, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SHALL SHOUT FOR JOY</small>. Everyone shall be healed, but just as one goes (to the grave), so he comes &#x003C; back &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">31</xref></sup> If he goes blind, he comes &#x003C; back &#x003E; blind. If he goes deaf, he comes deaf. If he goes lame, he comes lame. If he goes dumb, he comes dumb. Just as one goes clothed, so one comes clothed. Thus it is written (in Job 38:14): <small>IT IS CHANGED LIKE CLAY UNDER A SEAL; THEY STAND FORTH AS &#x003C; IN &#x003E; A GARMENT</small>. From whom do you learn this? From Samuel. When Saul raised him, what did he say to the woman (of Endor)? He said to her: What do you see, <small>AND</small> (according to I Sam. 28:14) <small>SHE SAID: IT IS AN OLD MAN RISING, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>; for he had been so clothed, as stated (in I Sam. 2:19): <small>HIS MOTHER WOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROBE FOR HIM</small>. So why is it that, just as one goes (to the grave), so one comes &#x003C; back &#x003E; ? So that the wicked of the world will not say: After they died, would the Holy One have healed them and later brought them &#x003C; back &#x003E;? It would seem that these are not the same ones (who died), but others. The Holy One said: If so, let them rise just as they went (to the grave), and afterwards I will heal them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 43:10): <small>&#x003C; SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT &#x003E; &#x2026; BEFORE ME NO GOD WAS FORMED</small>. Then later the beasts are healed, as stated (in Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER</small>&#x2026;. And why? Because it (the serpent)<sup><xref rid="fn1032">32</xref></sup> has brought everything to dust.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER, &#x003C; AND THE LION LIKE THE OX SHALL EAT STRAW &#x003E;</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>THE WOLF</small>: This is Benjamin, as stated (in Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. (Is. 65:25, cont.:) <small>AND THE LAMB</small>: This represents the tribes, as stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED FLOCK</small>&#x2026;. (Is. 65:25, cont.:) <small>SHALL FEED TOGETHER</small>: When? When Benjamin went down with them, and Jacob said (in Gen. 42:38): <small>LET NOT MY SON GO DOWN WITH YOU</small>. When the hour arrived for him to go down with them, they placed him in their midst and watched over him. And so Joseph (in Gen. 43:29): <small>LIFTED HIS EYES AND SAW HIS BROTHER BENJAMIN, THE SON OF HIS MOTHER</small>&#x2026;. (Is. 65:25, cont.:) <small>THE LION</small>: This is Judah, as stated (in Gen. 49:9): <small>JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>. (Is. 65:25, cont.:) <small>LIKE THE OX</small>: This is Joseph, since it is stated (in Deut. 33:17): <small>LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY</small>. (Is. 65:25, cont.:) <small>SHALL EAT STRAW</small>, when they have been found eating together, as stated (in Gen. 43:33): <small>AND THEY SAT DOWN BEFORE HIM FROM THE FIRST-BORN ACCORDING TO HIS BIRTHRIGHT</small>. Therefore (in Gen. 46:28): <small>NOW HE (Jacob) HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM</small>.</p>
<title>11.10 Genesis 46:28ff., Part II</title>
<p>[Gen. 46:28:) <small>NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH</small>.] The text is related (to Is. 11:13): <small>THEN EPHRAIM&#x2019;S JEALOUSY SHALL DEPART</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">33</xref></sup> &#x003C; He was sent &#x003E; because our father Jacob thought that Judah had killed Joseph because he had brought him the tunic, about which it is stated (in Gen. 37:33): <small>HE RECOGNIZED IT AND SAID: MY SON&#x2019;S TUNIC&#x0021; AN EVIL BEAST HAS EATEN HIM</small>. Now <small>AN EVIL BEAST</small> is nothing but a lion.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">34</xref></sup> So Jacob said to him: You have torn him to pieces, and you are going to tear his brother to pieces. You would not have torn him to pieces except out of jealousy. Immediately (there follows in Gen. 37:34): <small>THEN JACOB RENT HIS GARMENTS</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:35:) <small>NO, I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>. What is the meaning of <small>MOURNING TO &#x2026; SHEOL</small>? Perhaps I shall die the death of the wicked in this world and in the world to come. Why? Because the Holy One had promised to give me twelve tribes, and here one of them is dead. Perhaps I was not worthy of them, and I am to die in both worlds.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">35</xref></sup> For this reason he said (in vs. 35): <small>NO, I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL</small>. Do you want to know what he said when he saw that he was alive? (Gen. 46:30:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SAID UNTO JOSEPH: NOW LET ME DIE</small>. What was the reason for him to say: <small>NOW LET ME DIE</small>? He simply said: When they came and told me Joseph was dead, I said: I was to die in both worlds. Now that I have seen that you are alive, I am receiving the good news that I am only dying one time. <small>NOW LET ME DIE</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 37:35, cont.:) <small>SO HIS FATHER WEPT FOR HIM</small>. What is written next (in vs. 36)? <small>BUT THE MIDIANITES SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT</small>. The Holy One said to Judah: You have no children; therefore you do not know what the pain of children is. Now you have deceived your father and told him: Your son is dead. By your life, when you take a wife you shall bury your sons in order that you may know the pain of children. What is written next (in Gen. 38:1-10): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME THAT &#x003C; JUDAH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (The verses continue with the story of Judah&#x2019;s marriage to Shua, the birth of three sons, and the death of two of them.) It is also written (in Gen. 46:12): <small>&#x003C; AND THE SONS OF JUDAH: ER, ONAN, SHELAH, PEREZ, AND ZERAH &#x003E;; BUT ER AND ONAN HAD DIED &#x003C; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN &#x003E;</small>. Now all those years that Joseph had been away from his father, Jacob&#x2019;s mind had been against Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn1036">36</xref></sup> From where do you learn that? From Benjamin, about whom Judah said to Joseph (in Gen. 44:32): <small>FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD</small>. Then, as soon as he had set his mind on Benjamin and Joseph had made himself known, Judah was found to be innocent, as stated (in Is. 11:13): <small>THEN EPHRAIM&#x2019;S JEALOUSY SHALL DEPART, &#x003C; AND THOSE WHO HARASS JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Therefore (in Gen. 46:28): <small>NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH</small>.</p>
<title>11.11 Genesis 46:28ff., Part III</title>
<p>[Gen. 46:28:) <small>NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH</small>.] The text is related (to Mal. 3:1): <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING MY MESSENGER TO CLEAR A WAY BEFORE ME</small>&#x2026;. Come and see. Everything which happened to Joseph happened to Zion.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">37</xref></sup> It is written about Joseph (in Gen. 37:3): <small>NOW ISRAEL LOVED JOSEPH</small>; and it is written about Zion (in Ps. 87:2): <small>THE LORD LOVES ALL THE GATES OF ZION</small>.

It is written about Joseph (in Gen. 37:24): <small>AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT</small>; and it is written about Zion (in Lam. 3:53): <small>AND THEY HAVE DESTROYED MY LIFE IN THE PIT</small>.

It is written about Joseph (in Gen. 37:25): <small>THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT BREAD</small>; and it is written about Zion (in Lam. 5:6): <small>&#x003C; WE HAVE HELD OUT A HAND TO EGYPT &#x003E;, TO ASSYRIA TO BE FILLED WITH BREAD</small>.

<title>11.12 Genesis 46:28ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 46:28:) <small>NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH TO TEACH BEFORE HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1039">39</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>&#x003C; TO TEACH BEFORE HIM &#x003E;</small>? R. Nehemiah said: To establish an academy for him where he would teach Torah so that the tribes might study Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">40</xref></sup> You know that this is so; &#x003C; for &#x003E;, when Joseph had left him, Jacob knew at what chapter he had left him because he had taught him. When Joseph&#x2019;s brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): <small>JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; HIS HEART GREW FAINT</small>, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): <small>FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM</small>. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign<sup><xref rid="fn1041">41</xref></sup> &#x003C; indicating &#x003E; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer (&#x2018;<italic>GLH</italic>, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons (&#x2018;<italic>GLH</italic> in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): <small>SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS</small>. &#x003C; This verse is &#x003E; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): <small>AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS</small>. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &#x003C; His &#x003E; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): <small>EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Jonathan ben Eleazar Ish haBirah: Our father Abraham even knew the eruvim of cooked foods.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">42</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE (&#x2018;<italic>QB</italic> &#x2018;<italic>ShR</italic>) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE, &#x003C; AND KEPT MY CHARGE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): &#x2018;<italic>QB</italic> (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &#x003C; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): <small>AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN&#x2019;S PROSPERITY</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 12 Genesis, Parashah XII: <italic>Wayehi</italic></title>
<title>12.1 Genesis 47:28ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 47:28:) <small>AND JACOB LIVED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003C; SEVENTEEN YEARS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Why is this parashah more closed<sup><xref rid="fn1043">1</xref></sup> than all &#x003C; other &#x003E; parashiyyot?<sup><xref rid="fn1044">2</xref></sup> Because, as soon as Jacob died, the servitude of Israel began. But another reason is that he desired to reveal the end of days, but it was closed off from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1045">3</xref></sup> And another reason is that he closed off all the troubles in the world from him.</p>
<title>12.2 Genesis 47:28ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Gen. 47:29:) <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to I Chron. 29:15): <small>FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS; &#x007B;FOR&#x007D; OUR DAYS UPON EARTH ARE [LIKE] A SHADOW, AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">4</xref></sup> And &#x003C; they are &#x003E; not like the shadow of a wall or like the shadow of a tree. Rather they are like the shadow of a bird, as stated (in Ps. 144:4): <small>&#x007B;OUR&#x007D; [HIS] DAYS ARE LIKE A PASSING SHADOW</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">5</xref></sup> (I Chron. 29:15, end:) <small>AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>: There is no one who does not expect to die. All know that they are going to die. Abraham said (in Gen. 15:2): <small>FOR I AM GOING</small> (i.e., dying) <small>CHILDLESS</small>. Isaac said (in Gen. 27:4): <small>BEFORE I DIE</small>. Jacob said (in Gen. 47:30): <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS</small>. When? When he was on the point of death (according to Gen. 47:29): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.</p>
<title>12.3 Genesis 47:28ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Genesis 47:29:) <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.] This text is related (to Eccl. 8:8): <small>NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND TO CONTAIN THE WIND, NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: In regard to the trumpets which Moses made in the desert (according to Numb. 10:1-10) when he was at the point of death, the Holy One hid them lest he blow on them (the trumpets) for them (the Israelites) to come to him. &#x003C; This act was &#x003E; to fulfill what is stated (in Eccl. 8:8): <small>&#x003C; NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND TO CONTAIN THE WIND &#x003E;, NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>And when Zimri committed that act (of whoredom), what is written (in Numb. 25:8): <small>THEN HE (Phinehas) WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE CHAMBER &#x003C; AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM &#x003E;</small>. But how did Phinehas come to speak before Moses? In order to fulfill what is stated (in Eccl. 8:8) <small>NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">7</xref></sup> [Now &#x201C;death&#x201D; is nothing] but a word of humiliation. The saving act was given to Phinehas, and he humiliated Moses.</p>
<p>And also in the case of David, it is written of him (in I Kings 1:1): <small>NOW KING DAVID WAS OLD</small>. Then, when he was about to die, what is written (in I Kings 2:1)? <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>. &#x201C;King David&#x201D; is not written here but <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID &#x003C; TO DIE &#x003E; DREW NEAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1050">8</xref></sup> And also in the case of Jacob, when he was at the point of death, he began humiliating himself with Joseph and said (in Gen. 47:29): <small>PLEASE, IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES</small>. When? When he was approaching death (according to the beginning of the verse): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.</p>
<title>12.4 Genesis 47:28ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 47:29). What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>? Resh Laqish said: The Holy One said to him (Jacob): By your life, you are being hidden (from the world), but you are not dying.<sup><xref rid="fn1051">9</xref></sup> (Gen. 47:29:) <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1052">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 47:29). What is the meaning of <small>DREW NEAR</small>? The day (of your death) cries out against you for saying that it should stand still. &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is like someone who says: So-and-so has drawn near &#x003C; to fight &#x003E; against his friend. Ergo (in Gen. 47:29): <small>DREW NEAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our masters have said: Everyone about whom a drawing near was stated never attained the age of his ancestors. It is written (in I Kings 2:1): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR;</small> so he did not attain the age of his ancestors Boaz, Obed, and Jesse. Our masters have said: They lived more than four hundred years &#x003C; in all &#x003E; ; David only lived seventy years. He did not reach the age of his ancestors; therefore, a drawing near was written about him. Amram was alive a hundred and thirty &#x007B;-three&#x007D; [-seven] years, but Moses (his son) only lived to a hundred and twenty. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD, THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>. And in the case of Jacob, a drawing near is written about him because he did not attain the age of his ancestors. Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years; Isaac, a hundred and eighty; but Jacob, a hundred and forty-seven. Therefore, a drawing near is written about him (in Gen. 47:29): <small>THEN, WHEN THE DAYS FOR ISRAEL TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>.</p>
<title>12.5 Genesis 47:28ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>HE SUMMONED HIS SON JOSEPH</small>. Why did he not call Reuben and Judah?<sup><xref rid="fn1054">12</xref></sup> Reuben was the first-born, and Judah was a king; yet he left them alone and called Joseph. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; simply because the power to act was in his hand. Therefore: <small>HE SUMMONED HIS SON JOSEPH</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>AND SAID [TO HIM]: PLEASE, IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES, &#x003C; PLEASE PUT YOUR HAND UNDER MY THIGH &#x003E; AND ACT TOWARD ME WITH FIDELITY AND TRUTH</small>. But is there a false fidelity for him to say <small>WITH FIDELITY AND TRUTH</small>? Why &#x003C; then did he speak &#x003E; so? A common<sup><xref rid="fn1055">13</xref></sup> &#x003C; Aramaic &#x003E; proverb says: When your friend&#x2019;s son dies, suffer &#x003C; with him &#x003E;; when your friend dies, cut loose &#x003C; from sorrow &#x003E;. &#x003C; Jacob &#x003E; said to him: If you act towards me with fidelity after my death, that is true fidelity.</p>
<p>(Gen. 47:29, cont.:) <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>. Why? Because the end of Egypt is to be smitten with lice, and they would be swarming under my body.<sup><xref rid="fn1056">14</xref></sup> Therefore: <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>.</p>
<p>Another reason why Jacob did not want to be buried in Egypt was lest they produce idolatry through him; for, just as punishment is exacted from the worshipers of idolatry, so is punishment exacted from the idolatry itself, as stated (in Exod. 12:12): <small>AND ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS; I AM THE LORD</small>. And so you find with Daniel when he interpreted the dream for Nebuchadnezzar. What is written (in Dan. 2:46)? <small>THEN NEBUCHADNEZZAR FELL ON HIS FACE, PAID HOMAGE TO DANIEL, AND SAID TO OFFER HIM GRAIN AND INCENSE</small>. But Daniel did not want it. He said: Just as punishment is exacted from the worshipers of idolatry, so is punishment exacted from it (the idolatry). And so you find in the case of Hiram, when he made himself a god, what is written of him (in Ezek. 28:2)? <small>BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS PROUD, YOU HAVE SAID: I AM A GOD</small>. The Holy One said to him (in vs. 3): <small>SEE, YOU ARE WISER THAN DANIEL</small>. When Nebuchadnezzar wanted to sacrifice to him, he did not want it; but you have made yourself a god. What is your end (according to Ezek. 28:17)? <small>I HAVE CAST YOU &#x007B;UNTO&#x007D; [UPON] THE GROUND</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:29, cont.): Jacob said: So that the Egyptians would not be redeemed through me, since they are likened to the ass. It is so stated (in Ezek. 23:20): <small>WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>. And I have been likened to the flock, where it is stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED FLOCK</small>. It is also written (in Exod. 34:20): <small>BUT THE FIRSTLING OF AN ASS YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB</small>. Lest they be redeemed through me, for that reason (according to Gen. 47:29), <small>PLEASE DO NOT BURY ME IN EGYPT</small>.</p>
<title>12.6 Genesis 47:28ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Gen. 47:30:) <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS</small>&#x2026;. Why do all the ancestors search for and cherish burial in the land of Israel?<sup><xref rid="fn1057">15</xref></sup> R. Hananiah said: R. Joshua ben Levi said: There is a reason for this (in Ps. 116:9): <small>I WILL WALK BEFORE THE LORD IN THE LANDS OF THE LIVING</small>. Our masters have said two things in the name of R. Helbo: Why did the ancestors cherish the land of Israel for burial? Because the dead in the land of Israel shall be the first to revive in the days of the Messiah and enjoy the messianic years.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">16</xref></sup> R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: The one who dies outside of the land and is buried there has two deaths. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Jer. 20:6): <small>YOU ALSO, PASHUR, AND ALL WHO DWELL IN YOUR HOUSE SHALL GO INTO CAPTIVITY. SO YOU SHALL COME TO BABYLON, WHERE YOU SHALL DIE AND WHERE YOU SHALL BE BURIED, YOU ALONG WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO WHOM YOU PROPHESIED FALSELY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1059">17</xref></sup> R. Simon said: If so, are the righteous who are buried outside the land at a disadvantage? So what does the Holy One do? He &#x007B;goes back to&#x007D; [bores through] the land before them and makes them like skin bottles<sup><xref rid="fn1060">18</xref></sup> so that they come rolling &#x003C; on through &#x003E; until they arrive in the land of Israel. Then, when they arrive in the land of Israel, he puts the spirit of life in them; and they arise. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 37:12): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL OPEN YOUR GRAVES &#x2026; &#x003C; O MY PEOPLE, AND BRING YOU UNTO THE LAND OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. Then afterwards (in vs. 14): <small>AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU SHALL LIVE</small>. Resh Laqish said: Scripture clearly states that, when they arrive in the land of Israel, the Holy One puts breath in them, as stated (in Is. 42:5): <small>WHO GIVES BREATH TO THE PEOPLE UPON IT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1061">19</xref></sup> <small>AND SPIRIT TO THOSE WHO WALK THEREON</small>.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when R. Qatsra and R. Eleazar were walking by the gates<sup><xref rid="fn1062">20</xref></sup> outside of Tiberias, they saw a coffin of a dead person which had come from abroad to be buried in the land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">21</xref></sup> R. Qatsra said to R. Eleazar: What is the use when his soul departed outside of the land? I cite over him (Jer. 2:7): <small>YOU MADE MY HERITAGE AN ABOMINATION</small>, in your life; <small>THEN YOU CAME AND DEFILED MY LAND</small>, in your death.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">22</xref></sup> He said to him: Since he is buried in the land of Israel, the Holy One forgives (rt.: <italic>KPR</italic>) him, as stated (in Deut. 32:43): <small>AND HIS LAND ATONES FOR (<italic>KPR</italic>) HIS PEOPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>When R. Johanan was departing from the world, he said to his students: Please bury me only in dyed shrouds, neither in white shrouds [nor in black shrouds].<sup><xref rid="fn1066">24</xref></sup> If I rise among the righteous, I shall not be ashamed; and among the wicked I shall not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>When R. Judah was passing from the world, he said to the one who was standing over him: Tell them to call my disciples to me. He said to them: Bury me in white shrouds because I shall not be ashamed of my deeds when greeting my maker.</p>
<p>When Our Holy Rabbi was departing from the world, he commanded three things.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">25</xref></sup> He told them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not move my widow out of my house,</li>
<li>Do not mourn me in the cities which are in the land of Israel, and</li>
<li>Do not permit a stranger to touch my bier; but let whoever adhered to (rt.: <italic>TPL</italic>) me during my life attend to (rt.: <italic>TPL</italic>) me at my death.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">26</xref></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Now he dwelt in Sepphoris seventeen years.<sup><xref rid="fn1069">27</xref></sup> For thirteen years he suffered toothache; but for all those thirteen years no animal died in the land of Israel, and no pregnant woman miscarried in the land of Israel. Then, at the end of thirteen years Our Holy Rabbi became angry with R. Hiyya the Great. Elijah, of blessed memory, came to Our Holy Rabbi in the likeness of R. Hiyya. Then he put his hand on his tooth, and immediately it was healed. The next day R. Hiyya came to him. He said to him: Rabbi, how is that tooth of yours doing? He said to him: From the time that you put your hand upon it yesterday, it was healed. R. Hiyya said: Woe to you animals in the land of Israel; [woe to you pregnant women in the land of Israel]. Even so, he said to him: I did not put my hand on your tooth. Immediately Our Rabbi knew that it had been Elijah. From that hour R. Hiyya began to treat him with respect.<sup><xref rid="fn1070">28</xref></sup></p>
<title>12.7 Genesis 47:28ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Gen. 47:30:) <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS</small>. Jacob said to Joseph: If you do for me as I tell you, well and good; but, if not, my soul shall depart from me. He said to him: I am doing so for you&#x0021; He said to him (in vs. 31): <small>SWEAR &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;&#x0021; AND HE SWORE TO HIM</small>. When he had departed, what is written (in Gen. 50:12)? <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM [JUST] AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>. The Holy One said: In this world death does not allow one to rejoice, but in the world to come (according to Is. 25:8): <small>HE WILL SWALLOW UP DEATH FOREVER</small>&#x2026;. When death departs, what is written (Is. 65:19)? <small>I WILL ALSO SHOUT FOR JOY IN JERUSALEM AND REJOICE IN MY PEOPLE. THEN NEVER AGAIN SHALL BE HEARD THERE THE SOUND OF WEEPING AND THE SOUND OF CRYING OUT</small>.</p>
<title>12.8 Genesis 49:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 49:1:) <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>. Should it not rather have said: &#x201C;So Esau called his sons&#x201C;?<sup><xref rid="fn1071">29</xref></sup> Why? Because he was older. The Scripture says (in Is. 38:18): <small>FOR SHEOL SHALL NOT GIVE YOU THANKS; DEATH SHALL NOT PRAISE YOU</small>. Who gives thanks? One who lives and bows down to the living God. It is so stated (in vs. 19): <small>THE LIVING, &#x003C; ONLY &#x003E; THE LIVING SHALL GIVE YOU THANKS, EVEN AS I DO TODAY</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1072">30</xref></sup> And so Esau the Wicked did not die upon his bed and made no <italic>diatheke</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1073">31</xref></sup> (i.e., will). Then who did make a <italic>diatheke</italic>? Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 49, which begins): <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>.</p>
<title>12.9 Genesis 49:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Gen. 49:1:) <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>.] This text is related (to Job 12:20): <small>HE DEPRIVES THE TRUSTWORTHY OF SPEECH AND TAKES AWAY THE REASON OF ELDERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">32</xref></sup> This refers to Isaac and Jacob, in that both of them wanted to reveal a <italic>mysterion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1075">33</xref></sup> of the Holy One (i.e., his secret). Isaac called for Esau. He wanted to reveal the end to him, but the Holy One concealed it from him, as stated (in Gen. 27:1): <small>HE CALLED FOR HIS ELDER SON, ESAU; &#x003C; AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: MY SON; AND HE SAID: HERE AM I &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1076">34</xref></sup> Jacob also wanted to reveal the end to his sons,<sup><xref rid="fn1077">35</xref></sup> as stated (in Gen. 49:1): <small>&#x003C; THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS AND SAID &#x003E;: GATHER TOGETHER AND LET ME TELL YOU &#x003C; WHAT SHALL HAPPEN TO YOU IN THE LATTER DAYS &#x003E;</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a slave whom the king trusted with everything that he had.<sup><xref rid="fn1078">36</xref></sup> When that slave came to die, he called for his sons in order to make them free and tell them where their manumission document<sup><xref rid="fn1079">37</xref></sup> was. The king stood over him. When he saw him standing &#x003C; there &#x003E;, he discarded the thing which he had wanted to reveal to them. He began saying to them: Will you slaves of the king please honor him in the same way that I have honored him all my life? Similarly (according Gen. 49:1), Jacob called for his sons to inform them when the end would be. Immediately the Holy One was revealed over him. He said to him: You called for your sons but did not call for me. &#x003C; It is so stated &#x003E; (in Is. 43:22): <small>BUT YOU HAVE NOT CALLED ME, O JACOB</small>. When he saw the Holy One revealed over him, he immediately began saying to them: Will you please honor the Holy One just as my ancestors have honored him. It is so stated (in Gen. 48:15): <small>THE GOD BEFORE WHOM MY ANCESTORS &#x003C; ABRAHAM AND ISAAC &#x003E; WALKED</small>&#x2026;. They said to him (the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> of Deut. 6:4): <small>HEAR, O ISRAEL, THE LORD IS OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">38</xref></sup> Immediately (according to Gen. 47:31): <small>ISRAEL BOWED DOWN UPON THE HEAD OF THE BED</small>. He began to say in a whisper: <italic>Blessed be the name of his glorious kingdom forever and ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1081">39</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in Prov. 35:2): <small>IT IS THE GLORY OF GOD TO CONCEAL A MATTER</small>.</p>
<title>12.10 Genesis 49:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:1): <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 57:3 [2]): <small>I SHALL CALL TO GOD MOST HIGH, TO THE GOD WHO BRINGS THINGS TO COMPLETION FOR MY BENEFIT</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: An earthly court has decreed three things when the Holy One has concurred with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">40</xref></sup> They are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>One was in the days of Ezra. When they came back from Babylon, the Holy One wanted to absolve them of the tithes. What did they do? They arose and decreed on their own that they would tithe, as stated (in Neh. 10:38 [37]): <small>&#x003C; AND THAT WE SHOULD BRING TO THE PRIESTS, UNTO THE STOREROOMS IN THE HOUSE OF OUR GOD &#x003E;, THE FIRST OF OUR DOUGH, THE GRAIN OFFERINGS, THE FRUIT OF &#x003C; EVERY TREE, WINE AND OIL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. What did they do? They wrote it in a book and placed it in the Temple. The next day they entered and found it sealed because the Holy One had concurred with them. Thus it is stated (in Neh. 10:1 [9:38]): <small>BECAUSE OF ALL THIS, WE ARE MAKING A FIRM COVENANT &#x007B;SEALING IT OVER&#x007D; AND [PUTTING IT IN WRITING, AND UPON] THE SEALED COPY</small>&#x2026;.</li>
<li>And one was in the days of Mordecai and Esther, as stated (in Esth. 9:27): <small>&#x003C; THE JEWS &#x003E; INSTITUTED AND TOOK &#x003C; UPON THEMSELVES, THEIR DESCENDANTS, AND UPON ALL WHO WOULD JOIN THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT FAIL TO KEEP THESE TWO DAYS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. They instituted above what they had accepted below.</li>
<li>And one was in the days of Joshua, when Israel entered the land. Joshua said to them (in Josh. 6:17): <small>&#x007B;THE&#x007D; [THAT] CITY &#x003C; AND EVERYTHING IN IT &#x003E; ARE TO BE PROSCRIBED &#x003C; FOR THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. Now you do not find that the Holy One had told him this thing. Rather he did it on his own. And where is it shown that the Holy One concurred with him? Where it is stated (in Josh. 7:11): <small>ISRAEL HAS SINNED</small> (by breaking the proscription).</li>
</ol>
<p>Ergo (in Ps. 57: [2]): <small>I SHALL CALL TO GOD MOST HIGH, TO THE GOD WHO BRINGS THINGS TO COMPLETION FOR MY BENEFIT</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: <small>I SHALL CALL TO GOD MOST HIGH</small>. &#x003C; This &#x003E; speaks about Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">41</xref></sup> When his sons came for him to bless them, he began to distribute <italic>prokopai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1084">42</xref></sup> (i.e., gifts) to them. And where is it shown that the Holy One concurred with him? You find that in the case of all the blessings with which our father Jacob blessed the tribes, Moses blessed them with the same &#x003C; blessings &#x003E; because the Holy One concurred with him in the case of each and every blessing. Ergo (in Gen. 49:1): <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1085">43</xref></sup></p>
<title>12.11 Genesis 49:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Gen. 49:1:) <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS AND SAID: GATHER TOGETHER</small>.] R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest and R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: What is the meaning of <small>GATHER TOGETHER (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;SP</italic>)</small>? Be purified, even as you say (in Numb. 12:14 with reference to Miriam&#x2019;s uncleanness from leprosy): <small>LET HER BE SHUT UP SEVEN DAYS OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP, AND THEN LET HER BE BROUGHT IN (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;SP</italic>)</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:1): <small>GATHER TOGETHER (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;PR</italic>)</small>. Become individual study groups (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;PR</italic>). What did they do? When they entered, he began reproaching<sup><xref rid="fn1087">45</xref></sup> them.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Gen. 49:3:) <small>REUBEN, YOU ARE MY FIRST-BORN</small>. One said &#x003C; it was &#x003E; to his discredit, and another said &#x003C; it was &#x003E; to his credit. To his discredit: He said to him: <small>REUBEN, YOU ARE MY FIRST-BORN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1089">47</xref></sup> You are a first-born, and I am a firstborn.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">48</xref></sup> R.

<p>(Gen. 49:3, cont.:) <small>MY MIGHT AND THE FIRST FRUIT OF MY STRENGTH, EXCELLING IN ELEVATION</small>, in that the high priesthood had been designated for you, and there is no <small>ELEVATION</small> but the high priesthood.

<p>(Gen. 49:3, cont.:) <small>AND EXCELLING IN POWER</small>, in that the kingship had been designated for you, and there is no power but kingship. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 2:10): <small>AND HE SHALL GIVE POWER TO HIS KING</small>. And another said &#x003C; it (i.e., Gen. 49:3) was &#x003E; to his credit. <small>REUBEN, YOU ARE MY FIRST-BORN</small>. You are suitable for the birthright, even though you desecrated it. He had been filled with jealousy for his mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1094">52</xref></sup> Why? All the days that Rachel lived, Jacob&#x2019;s bed was with her. When she died, Jacob took his bed and put it with Bilhah. What did Reuben do? He became jealous for his mother. He pretended to be asleep on that bed so that Jacob would put his bed with Leah.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">53</xref></sup> It therefore is praising<sup><xref rid="fn1096">54</xref></sup> him (in Gen. 49:3): <small>REUBEN, YOU ARE MY FIRST-BORN, MY MIGHT AND THE FIRST FRUIT OF MY STRENGTH</small>. You were the first drop (of semen) that came out of me.</p>
<title>12.12 Genesis 49:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 49:4:) <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER, YOU SHALL NO LONGER EXCEL</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AS WATER?</small> R. Jeremiah and R. Nathan differ. One said &#x003C; it was &#x003E; to his discredit, and the other said &#x003C; it was &#x003E; to his credit. What does it mean &#x003C; when interpreted &#x003E; to his discredit? <small>AS WATER</small>. You have left yourself nothing. Instead &#x003C; you became &#x003E; <small>AS WATER</small>. How so? When one empties a cask of honey, he leaves a little in it. When one pours with water in it, he leaves nothing in it. So you have left yourself nothing of merit; instead &#x003C; you are as &#x003E; <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>. But the other said &#x003C; it was &#x003E; to his credit. What is the meaning of <small>AS WATER</small>? Anyone who empties honey or oil leaves a little. You did not leave yourself sin, but were <small>AS WATER</small>. Just as the water cleanses, so also have you been cleansed.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:4): <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>. The word <small>(UNSTABLE)</small> is an acronym.<sup><xref rid="fn1097">55</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: What is the meaning of <small>UNSTABLE (<italic>PHZ</italic>)</small>? O wretched one (<italic>pahit</italic>), you have sinned (<italic>hatit</italic>); You have committed adultery (<italic>zanit</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1098">56</xref></sup> You have wasted your strength.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:4): <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>.] Our masters have taught (in <italic>Ter</italic>. 8:4): <small>THREE LIQUIDS BECOME FORBIDDEN THROUGH BEING UNCOVERED: WATER, WINE, AND MILK</small>. If wine is found uncovered, then one is sorry about it when he pours it out; but in the case of water, if it is found uncovered, one is not sorry for it if he pours it out. So you have done with all the crowns which belonged to me. You have thrown them away <small>AS WATER</small>. &#x003C; You are as &#x003E; <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>. When Simeon and Levi came in to Jacob, he reproached<sup><xref rid="fn1099">57</xref></sup> them. He said (in Gen. 49:5): <small>SIMEON AND LEVI ARE BROTHERS, WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE ARE THEIR <italic>MEKHEROT</italic></small><sup><xref rid="fn1100">58</xref></sup> What are <small><italic>MEKHEROT</italic>? WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE</small>.</p>
<p>(Gen. 49:6:) <small>LET NOT MY SOUL COME INTO THEIR COUNCIL, AND LET NOT MY GLORY BE JOINED WITH THEIR ASSEMBLY</small>. When these two tribes (of Simeon and Levi) are assembled, let not my name be mentioned there. When Zimri arises and sins, <small>LET NOT MY GLORY BE JOINED</small> &#x003C; with them &#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn1101">59</xref></sup> [since it is stated (in Numb. 25:14): <small>ZIMRI BEN SALU, PRINCE OF A CLAN BELONGING TO THE SIMEONITES</small>.

<p>(Gen. 49:6:) <small>FOR IN THEIR ANGER THEY KILLED A MAN</small>, when they killed Shechem ben Hamor. He said to them: You have afflicted me. Immediately (in vs. 7): <small>CURSED BE THEIR ANGER SO FIERCE</small>. These tribes were unable to dwell together. Rather (ibid., cont.): <small>I WILL DIVIDE THEM IN JACOB AND SCATTER THEM IN ISRAEL</small>. Judah came in and &#x003C; Jacob &#x003E; praised him (in vs. 8): <small>YOU, O JUDAH, YOUR BROTHERS SHALL PRAISE (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>)</small>. In your case, your mother gave praise (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) through your name (Judah, rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>). When she bore you, she said (in Gen. 29:35): <small>THIS TIME I WILL PRAISE (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) THE LORD; &#x003C; THEREFORE SHE CALLED HIS NAME JUDAH (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) &#x003E;</small>. And what did she see to praise in Judah? It is simply that she had given birth to Reuben and foreseen Dathan and Abiram (in Numb. 16:1); so she had not given praise over him (i.e., Reuben). She had given birth to Simeon and foreseen Zimri; so she had not given praise over him. She had given birth to Levi and foreseen Korah; so she had not given praise over him. When she gave birth to Judah, she immediately gave praise (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) over him because he made a confession (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) in the Tamar incident, as stated (in Gen. 38:26): <small>THEN JUDAH GAVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND SAID: SHE IS MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN I</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">61</xref></sup> His father said to him: Your mother has given praise (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) over you, and you have made a confession (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>). Therefore your brothers shall praise (rt.: <italic>YDH</italic>) you.<sup><xref rid="fn1104">62</xref></sup> When Isaac blessed Jacob, he had said to him (in Gen. 27:29): <small>AND MAY YOUR MOTHER&#x2019;S CHILDREN BOW DOWN TO YOU</small>, since he had only one wife. But, since Jacob had four wives, he said (in Gen. 49:8): <small>YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S CHILDREN &#x003C; SHALL BOW DOWN TO YOU &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1105">63</xref></sup> Why shall your brothers praise you? Because all Israel shall be called by your name, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; Jews.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">64</xref></sup> And not only that, but out of you is coming the Messiah, who is saving Israel, as stated (in Is. 11:10): <small>BUT A SHOOT SHALL COME FORTH FROM THE STEM OF JESSE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">65</xref></sup></p>
<title>12.13 Genesis 49:27ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Gen. 49:27:) <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. This text is related (to Amos 3:7): <small>SURELY THE LORD GOD DOES NOTHING WITHOUT HAVING REVEALED IT UNTO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1108">66</xref></sup> In the beginning the counsel of the <small>LORD</small> was for those who feared him, as stated (in Ps. 25:14): <small>THE COUNSEL OF THE LORD IS FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>. Later he gave it to the upright, as stated (in Prov. 3:32): <small>BUT HIS COUNSEL IS WITH THE UPRIGHT</small>. &#x003C; Still &#x003E; later he gave it to the prophets, as stated (in Amos 3:7) <small>SURELY THE LORD GOD DOES NOTHING WITHOUT HAVING REVEALED IT UNTO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>.</p>
<p>Everything that the righteous do they do through the Holy Spirit. When Jacob blessed Judah, he blessed him with &#x003C; the qualities of &#x003E; a lion, as stated (in Gen. 49:9): <small>JUDAH IS A LION&#x2019;S WHELP</small>. &#x003C; Thus he paired him off &#x003E; <sup><xref rid="fn1109">67</xref></sup> against the kingdom of Babylon, of which it is written (in Dan. 7:4): <small>THE FIRST WAS LIKE A LION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1110">68</xref></sup> So Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (descendants of Judah) attacked it (i.e., Babylon). As for Joseph, he paired him off against this &#x003C; present &#x003E; wicked kingdom of Rome. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: There is a tradition handed down that Esau will only fall at the hands of Rachel&#x2019;s children. [Thus it is stated (in Jer. 49:20): <small>SURELY THE YOUNGEST OF THE FLOCK SHALL DRAG THEM</small><sup><xref rid="fn1111">69</xref></sup> <small>AWAY</small>.] And Moses paired off the tribe of Levi against the kingdom of Greece, since the children of the Hasmoneans stem from Levi. Also Levi is the third tribe, and this kingdom of Greece is the third &#x003C; kingdom &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1112">70</xref></sup> Moreover, Levi (<italic>LWY</italic>) has three letters, and Greece (<italic>YWN</italic>) has three letters. The former sacrifices bulls, and the latter writes on the horn of an ox. They have no portion in the God of Israel. The former are many, and the latter are few. Moses saw them and blessed them, as stated (in Deut. 33:11 with reference to Levi): <small>BLESS, O LORD, HIS VALOR&#x2026; &#x003C; SMITE THE LOINS OF THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST HIM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And Jacob paired Benjamin off against the kingdom of Media. Thus it is written about the kingdom of Media (in Dan. 7:5): <small>THEN HERE WAS ANOTHER BEAST, A SECOND ONE, LIKE A BEAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1113">71</xref></sup> So here is an analogy with it (Media) over against the tribe of Benjamin to which it is likened, as stated (in Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. Just as the wolf seizes &#x003C; its prey &#x003E;, so did the tribe of Benjamin seize &#x003C; something &#x003E;, as stated (in Jud. 21:21): <small>WHEN YOU SEE &#x007B;THE DAUGHTERS OF SHILOH&#x007D; [AND BEHOLD, IF THE DAUGHTERS OF SHILOH COME OUT]&#x2026; &#x003C; THEN YOU SHALL COME OUT OF THE VINEYARDS &#x003E;, SEIZE FOR YOURSELVES &#x003C; EACH ONE HIS OWN WIFE FROM THE DAUGHTERS OF SHILOH, AND GO TO THE LAND OF BENJAMIN &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>12.14 Genesis 49:27ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks of its judge, Ehud.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">72</xref></sup> What is written (in Jud. 3:16)? <small>SO EHUD MADE HIMSELF A SWORD, AND IT HAD TWO EDGES</small>, i.e., he was busy with Torah, which (in Ps. 149:6) is called <small>A TWO-EDGED SWORD. AND</small> (according to Jud. 3:16) <small>IT HAD TWO EDGES</small> (literally: <small>TWO MOUTHS</small>) because it consumes in two worlds, in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Jud. 3:16): <small>SO EHUD MADE HIMSELF A SWORD</small> and put it <small>ON HIS RIGHT THIGH</small>. Coming in to Eglon, he said to him: <small>I HAVE A WORD FROM GOD FOR YOU &#x007B;THE KING&#x007D;; SO HE AROSE FROM HIS SEAT</small>. The Holy One said: You have imparted glory to me and risen from your seat for the sake of my glory. By your life, I will raise up a daughter from you from whom a son shall arise, and I will seat him upon my throne. This woman was Ruth the Moabite, from whom arose Solomon, of whom it is written (in I Chron. 29:23): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD</small>. What is written (in Jud. 3:21)? <small>THEN EHUD PUT OUT HIS LEFT HAND AND TOOK THE SWORD FROM HIS RIGHT THIGH</small>. (Cf. Gen. 49:27, cont.:) <small>IN THE MORNING HE DEVOURS THE PREY</small>. (Jud. 3:21, cont.:) <small>AND HE THRUST IT INTO HIS BELLY</small>. (Cf. Gen. 49:27, cont.:) <small>AND AT EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL</small>.</p>
<title>12.15 Genesis 49:27ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about the land.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">73</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IN THE MORNING HE DEVOURS THE PREY</small>. This is Jericho, in that it produces its fruit early. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND AT EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL</small>. This is Bethel, in that it is late with its fruit late.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Saul. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IN THE MORNING HE DEVOURS THE PREY</small>. (Cf.

<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Queen Esther. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IN THE MORNING HE DEVOURS THE PREY</small>. (Cf. Esth. 7:1:) <small>SO THE KING AND HAMAN CAME TO FEAST &#x003C; WITH QUEEN ESTHER &#x003E;</small>.

<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:27): <small>BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about sacrifice.

<title>12.16 Genesis 49:27ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Gen. 49:28:) <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, TWELVE IN NUMBER</small>. These are the tribes, but &#x003C; it is written &#x003E; elsewhere about Ishmael (in Gen. 17:20): <small>HE SHALL SIRE TWELVE PRINCES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">76</xref></sup> As for the tribes, that has a basis in the structure of the world. The day has twelve hours, the night has twelve hours, the year has twelve months, &#x003C; and there are &#x003E; twelve planets. R. Johanan said: Were there &#x003C; really &#x003E; twelve tribes? Now do not Ephraim and Manasseh make fourteen? It is simply that, when Levi was numbered with them, Ephraim and Manasseh were not numbered with them. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in the list of Numb. 1:10, which omits Levi): <small>FROM THE CHILDREN OF JOSEPH: FROM EPHRAIM, ELISHAMA BEN AMMIHUD; FROM MANASSEH, GAMALIEL BEN PEDAHZUR</small>. Ergo (in Gen. 49:28): <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, TWELVE IN NUMBER</small>, no less and no more. Even Rebekah saw &#x007B;them&#x007D; [these twelve], as stated (in Gen. 25:23):<sup><xref rid="fn1119">77</xref></sup> <small>AND THE LORD SAID TO HER: TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR WOMB</small>. Here are two. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND TWO PEOPLES &#x003C; SHALL ISSUE &#x003E; FROM YOUR BOWELS</small>. Here are four. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ONE PEOPLE SHALL BE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER</small>. Here are six. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE ELDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER</small>. Here are eight. (Vs. 24:) <small>AND BEHOLD, THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB</small>. Here are ten. (Vs. 22:) <small>AND THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED WITHIN HER</small>. Here are twelve.</p>
<title>12.17 Genesis 49:27ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Gen. 49:28, cont.:) <small>AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM WHEN HE BLESSED THEM. EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING IS HOW HE BLESSED THEM</small>. &#x201C;Him&#x201D; is not written here but <small>HE BLESSED THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">78</xref></sup> Why so? Because (in Gen. 49:8-22) he gave Judah the strength of a lion, Joseph the strength of an ox,<sup><xref rid="fn1121">79</xref></sup> Naphtali the lightness of a deer, and Dan the bite of a serpent. You might say that one is greater than another; &#x003C; so &#x003E; their commonality is &#x003C; mentioned &#x003E; at the end. <small>EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING &#x2026; HE BLESSED THEM</small>. Thus he distributed the land to them. He gave Judah the land which produces barley and Benjamin land which produces wheat. Even so, they had a commonality with each other in that they each would eat what belonged to the other. Ergo (in Gen. 49:28): <small>AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM</small>. &#x201C;Unto them&#x201D; is not written here but <small>TO THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">80</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>AND THIS</small> &#x003C; is how &#x003E; someone like me is going to bless you, and at the place where I have stopped he is beginning. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1123">81</xref></sup> When Moses arose, he opened (the blessing in Deut. 33:1) with <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING &#x003C; WITH WHICH MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD, BLESSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEFORE HE DIED &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; He began &#x003E; from where Jacob had stopped. Ergo (in Gen. 49:28 also): <small>AND THIS</small>. He said these blessings for them. When did they come to pass for you? From the time that you received the Torah, about which it is written (in Deut. 4:44): <small>AND THIS IS THE TORAH</small>. Note the <small>AND THIS</small>. And also, with whatever &#x003C; expression &#x003E; Jacob had closed his blessing, Moses opened for them. Moses said (in Ps. 119:100): <small>I HAVE GAINED UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ELDERS</small>. When Isaac blessed Jacob, he said (in Gen. 28:3): <small>MAY GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU</small>. With what did he finally close his blessing? With a calling (according to Gen. 28:1): <small>SO ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM</small>. So, in the case of Jacob, where his father had stopped, from there he had begun (according to Gen. 49:1): <small>THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS</small>. Then, Jacob stopped (in Gen. 49:28) with <small>THIS</small>; so Moses also, when he arose to bless the tribes, began with <small>AND THIS</small> (in Deut. 33:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>. And with what did Moses close? With <small>BLESSED ARE YOU</small>, as stated (in Deut. 33:29): <small>BLESSED ARE YOU, O ISRAEL&#x0021; WHO IS LIKE YOU</small>? See &#x003C; how &#x003E; David opened (Ps. 1:1)&#x0021; With <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 119:100): <small>I HAVE GAINED UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ELDERS</small>.</p>
<title>12.18 Genesis 49:27ff., Part VI</title>
<p>&#x007B;Another interpretation (of Gen. 49:28): <small>AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM</small>.&#x007D; [(Gen. 50:12:) <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM JUST AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>.] What did they do? They embalmed him and brought him up &#x003C; to the land of Israel &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">82</xref></sup> What is written (in Gen. 50:10)? <small>WHEN THEY CAME TO THE THORNBUSH THRESHING FLOOR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">83</xref></sup> Is there a threshing floor for thorns, as it says: <small>TO THE THORNBUSH THRESHING FLOOR</small>? It is simply that these were Canaanites who had taken their crowns and surrounded Jacob&#x2019;s coffin, as a threshing floor when one surrounds it with thorns. R. Eliezer says: When they saw the coffin of our father Jacob, they undid the girdles on their waists and &#x003C; so &#x003E; showed honor to our father Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">84</xref></sup> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: They undid their finger joints; and our masters say: They pointed the finger at Jacob&#x2019;s coffin and said (in Gen. 50:11): <small>THIS IS A SOLEMN MOURNING FOR THE EGYPTIANS</small>. For this reason the Holy One gave them a threshing floor.<sup><xref rid="fn1127">85</xref></sup> (Gen. 50:10:) <small>AND HE CARRIED OUT SEVEN DAYS OF MOURNING FOR HIS FATHER</small>. From here we learn that the time for mourning is seven days. They also give evidence for it from here (in Lev. 8:33): <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT FROM THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. And why do they carry out seven days of mourning rites? &#x003C; It &#x003E; corresponds to the seven days of feasting (on a joyous occasion). The Holy One said to them: In this world you have exhibited sorrow in the company of this righteous man and observed a seven-day mourning for him. In the world to come I am turning this mourning into feasting, as stated (in Jer. 31:13): <small>FOR I WILL TURN THEIR MOURNING INTO JOY, COMFORT THEM, AND CHEER THEM IN THEIR GRIEF</small>. Then, just as I comfort them, so I will give comfort to Zion, as stated (in Is. 51:3): <small>TRULY THE LORD HAS COMFORTED ZION; HE HAS COMFORTED ALL ITS RUINS. HE HAS ALSO MADE ITS DESERT LIKE EDEN AND ITS DRY PLAIN LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD. JOY AND REJOICING SHALL BE FOUND IN IT, THANKSGIVING AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC</small>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1053">11. &#x201C;Draw near&#x201D; can be used in the sense of &#x201C;attack&#x201D; in Hebrew. The midrash here is picturing a person&#x2019;s last day crying out against any attempt to extend life by trying to keep the day from ending.</ftnote>

Buber cites Samuel Jaffe ben Isaac Ashkenazi, <italic>Yefeh To&#x2019;ar</italic>, a commentary on the Midrash Rabbah, Part I on Genesis (Venice, 1597&#x2014;1606), who cites Rashi, on Gen. 24:7, and explains that &#x201C;to them&#x201D; (<italic>lahem</italic>) used with the verb &#x201C;speak&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>DBR</italic>), as opposed to its use with the verb &#x201C;say&#x201D; (rt.: <italic>&#x2019;MR</italic>), means that one is speaking &#x201C;concerning them&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;with them,&#x201D; which is what &#x201C;unto them&#x201D; (<italic>alehem</italic>) would have implied.

<ftnote id="fn1123">81. Apart from the words <small>AND THIS</small> (in the sense of <small>ALSO THIS</small>), there is another hint there that the verse has a wider meaning in that Jacob is simply alluded to as <small>THEIR FATHER</small> instead of by name.
