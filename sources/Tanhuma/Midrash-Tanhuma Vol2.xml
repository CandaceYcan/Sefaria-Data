<p>This volume follows essentially the same format as volume I on Genesis. Here again there were various students who provided helpful suggestions in the translation. These included Eugene McAfee, Pamela C. Robertson, Caroline J. Libresco, and Michael E. Pregill.</p>
<p>In particular I wish to express my most heartfelt gratitude to my mother, who provided the initial proofreading for the first volume and for most of this volume. She tried to finish while she was dying in the hospital, and managed to complete all but the last half of the final section.</p>
<p>It is to her</p>
<p>Olley Tolson Townsend</p>
<p>that this volume is dedicated.</p>

<title>Chapter 1 Exodus, Parashah I: <italic>Shemot</italic></title>
<title>1.1 Exodus 1:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:1:) <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 48:11 [10]): <small>AS YOUR NAME, O GOD, SO DOES YOUR PRAISE &#x003C; REACH &#x003E; TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH &#x003C;YOUR RIGHT HAND IS FULL OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. &#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> When a king of flesh and blood enters a country, they praise<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> him for being mighty while he is actually frail. They praise him for being merciful while he is actually cruel. They praise him for being handsome while he is actually ugly. They give him much praise for such things. With the Holy One, however, such is not the case. Rather, whenever anyone praises him, he exceeds the praise. How so? They praise him for being mighty; and he is mighty, as stated (in Deut. 10:17): <small>THE GREAT, THE MIGHTY, AND THE AWESOME GOD</small>. They praise him for being handsome; and he is handsome, as stated (in Cant. 5:10): <small>MY BELOVED IS BRIGHT AND RUDDY</small>. They praise him for being merciful; and he is merciful, as stated (in Deut. 4:31): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A MERCIFUL GOD</small> &#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 48:11 [10]): <small>LIKE YOUR NAME, O GOD, SO DOES YOUR PRAISE &#x003C; REACH &#x003E; TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: See what is written (in Exod. 15:11): <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES &#x003C; AND &#x003E; DOING WONDERS</small>. Huna bar Abbin the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES</small>? God is awesome over &#x003C;and above &#x003E; all your praises. Ergo (in Exod. 15:11): <small>AWESOME IN PRAISES</small>. R. Simon said: See what David said (in I Chron. 29:11) <small>TO YOU, O LORD, BELONG THE GREATNESS, THE MIGHT&#x2026;; YOUR NAME IS EXALTED AS HEAD OVER ALL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; the greatness for which we praise you.</p>
<p>R. Abbin the Levite said: See how the men of the Great Synagogue praised the Holy One&#x0021; [(Neh. 9:5:) <small>BLESSED BE YOUR GLORIOUS NAME; FOR IT IS EXALTED ABOVE EVERY BLESSING AND PRAISE</small>.] However we praise you, your name <small>IS EXALTED ABOVE EVERY BLESSING AND PRAISE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 48:11 [10]): <small>LIKE YOUR NAME, O GOD, &#x003C;SO DOES YOUR PRAISE &#x003C;REACH&#x003E; TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<p>R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: There are people [whose names are handsome and whose deeds are ugly;] &#x003C;There are&#x003E; those whose names are ugly and whose deeds are handsome; there are those whose names are handsome and whose deeds are handsome; there are those whose names are ugly and whose deeds are ugly.<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> There are those whose names are handsome and whose deeds are ugly: Such is Absalom (whose name means &#x201C;father of peace&#x201D;), of whom it is stated (in II Sam. 16:22): <small>AND ABSALOM WENT UNTO HIS FATHER&#x2019;S CONCUBINES</small>. Those whose names are ugly and whose deeds are handsome: These are the ones who went up &#x003C;from&#x003E; exile, of whom it is stated (in Ezra 2:53 &#x003D; Neh. 7:55): <small>THE CHILDREN OF</small> {<small>BARKOM</small>} [<small>BARKOS</small>],<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> <small>THE CHILDREN OF SISERA</small> (cf. Jud. 4&#x2013;5), <small>THE CHILDREN OF TEMAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> Those whose names are ugly and whose deeds are ugly: These are the spies. What is written (in Numb. 13:13)? <small>FROM THE TRIBE OF ASHER, SETHUR</small> (a name which means &#x201C;disheveled&#x201D;) <small>BEN MICHAEL</small>. Those whose names are handsome and whose deeds are handsome: These are the tribes, of which it is stated (in Exod. 1:1&#x2013;2): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;: REUBEN, SIMEON, LEVI, AND JUDAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.2 Exodus 1:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 147:3&#x2013;4): <small>WHO HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED&#x2026;. HE RECKONS THE NUMBER OF THE STARS; HE GIVES THEM ALL NAMES</small>. When Jacob died, what is written (in Gen. 50:15)? <small>WHEN JOSEPH&#x2019;S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD</small>. What did they see? They saw that, as long as Jacob was alive, Joseph dined with them, and they would eat at his table. Then, when Jacob was dead, they did not eat at his table. Thus it is stated: <small>WHEN JOSEPH&#x2019;S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD</small>, they said: There is evil hidden in Joseph&#x2019;s heart; (ibid., end:) <small>AND HE WILL SURELY REPAY US FOR ALL THE EVIL WHICH WE RENDERED HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> (Vs. 16:) <small>SO THEY SENT A MESSAGE UNTO JOSEPH, SAYING</small>. To whom did they entrust the message? To Bilhah.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in vs. 17): <small>SO SHALL YOU SAY TO JOSEPH: PLEASE FORGIVE, PRAY</small> (<italic>anna</italic>), <small>&#x003C;THE TRANSGRESSION AND GUILT OF YOUR BROTHERS&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Abbin said: The Holy One said: You used this word <italic>anna</italic>. A high priest is going to enter the Holy of Holies and utter a <italic>synegoria</italic><sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> for your children with this expression: <italic>Anna haShem</italic> (Pray, O Eternal One).<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND NOW, PLEASE FORGIVE THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE SERVANTS OF THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER</small>. &#x201C;The transgression of your servants&#x201D; is not written here but <small>THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE SERVANTS OF THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER</small>. Although your father is dead, know that his God is alive. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND JOSEPH WEPT AS THEY SPOKE TO HIM</small>. Joseph said: Thus have my brothers distrusted me. (Gen. 50:21:) <small>SO HE COMFORTED THEM AND SPOKE TO THEM KINDLY</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al lev</italic>) of things which depend upon the heart (&#x2018;<italic>al lev</italic>). He said to them: Before you came down to Egypt, the people were opposed to me, saying: He is a slave.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> Now you have been brought down and have made it known that I am the child of free &#x003C; parents &#x003E;. So should I kill you? They would say: Is there a person who would kill his brothers? Ergo (in Gen. 50:21): <small>SO HE COMFORTED THEM</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 50:21): He said to them: You are ten and have not overcome me. Now, since I am one, shall I overcome ten? Ergo (in Gen. 50:21): <small>SO HE COMFORTED THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: David said (in Ps. 147:3): <small>WHO HEALS THE BROKEN HEARTED</small>&#x2026;. These are the tribes since they had a broken heart, saying &#x003C;that&#x003E; Joseph might kill them. (Ps. 147:4:) <small>HE RECKONS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MNH</small></italic>) <small>THE NUMBER OF THE STARS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> These are the tribes. Just as these stars only go forth by &#x003C; their &#x003E; names, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>HE GIVES THEM ALL NAMES</small>; and likewise, when they come in, they come in with a reckoning (<italic>minyan</italic>, rt.: <italic><small>MNH</small></italic>), as stated (in Ps. 147:4): <small>HE RECKONS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MNH</small></italic>) <small>THE NUMBER OF THE STARS</small>; so &#x003C;also&#x003E; in the case of the tribes, when they entered Egypt, it is written (in Deut. 10:22): <small>WITH SEVENTY SOULS DID YOUR ANCESTORS GO DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. Also, when they left, (according to Exod. 12:37): <small>ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT</small>. And before<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> the tribes went down to Egypt, their names were specified (in Gen. 46). Also, when they entered Egypt, their names were specified, as stated (in Exod. 1:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>1.3 Exodus 1:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:1:) <small>AND THESE ARE THE NAMES</small>&#x2026;. R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Jose ben Zimra: Wherever there is stated: <small>THESE</small>, &#x003C;the expression&#x003E; invalidates what precedes; but wherever there is stated: <small>AND THESE</small> &#x003C;the expression&#x003E; adds on to what precedes.<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.4 Exodus 1:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:1, cont.:) <small>WHO ARE COMING</small> (<italic>haba&#x2019;im</italic>) <small>TO EGYPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> They had already been there a long time.<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> Then why does it say &#x003C;here&#x003E; (in Exod. 1:1): <small>WHO ARE COMING</small> (<italic>haba&#x2019;im</italic>)? It is simply that as long as Joseph was alive, the burden of the Egyptians did not come upon them; but, as soon as Joseph was dead, the burden of the Egyptians was set upon them. Ergo: <small>WHO ARE COMING</small> (<italic>haba&#x2019;im</italic>). &#x003C;It was&#x003E; as if all <small>WHO CAME</small> (<italic>haba&#x2019;im</italic>) <small>TO EGYPT</small> had entered Egypt on that very day.</p>
<p>(Exod. 1:1, cont.:) <small>WITH JACOB</small>. From where are those <small>WHO CAME</small>? From the strength of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 1:1, cont.:) <small>EACH ONE COMING WITH HIS HOUSEHOLD</small>. R. Huna said: This teaches that Jacob did not go down to Egypt until he had numbered &#x003C;in his family &#x003E; Perez and Hezron. The one was a year old, and the other was two years old.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> Then he paired<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> them with wives.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.5 Exodus 1:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:2&#x2013;4:) <small>REUBEN, SIMEON, LEVI, AND JUDAH</small>; <small>&#x003C;ISSACHAR, ZEBULUN, AND BENJAMIN; DAN AND NAPHTALI, GAD AND ASHER</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> All the names of the tribes have been mentioned &#x003C; elsewhere &#x003E; in reference with their redemption.</p>
<p>1. <small>REUBEN</small> (<italic><small>R&#x2019;WBN</small></italic>) (in Exod. 3:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I HAVE SURELY SEEN</small> (<italic><small>R&#x2019;YTI</small></italic>) &#x003C; <small>MY PEOPLE&#x2019;S AFFLICTION</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<p>2. <small>SIMEON</small> (<italic><small>ShM&#x2018;WN</small></italic>) (in Exod. 2:24): <small>AND GOD HEARD</small> (rt.: <italic>ShM</italic>&#x2018;) <small>THEIR MOANING</small>.</p>
<p>3. <small>LEVI</small> (<italic><small>LWY</small></italic>) (in Zech. 2:15 [11]): <small>AND MANY NATIONS SHALL JOIN THEMSELVES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LWY</small></italic>) <small>UNTO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<p>4. <small>JUDAH</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YDH</small></italic>) (in Is. 12:1): <small>AND IN THAT DAY YOU SHALL SAY: I GIVE THANKS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YDH</small></italic>) <small>TO YOU, O LORD</small>.</p>
<p>5. <small>ISSACHAR</small> (<italic><small>YShShKR</small></italic>) (in Jer. 31:15 [16], as part of a redemption message for the northern tribes): <small>FOR THERE IS REWARD</small> (<italic><small>YSh ShKR</small></italic>) <small>FOR YOUR LABOR</small>.</p>
<p>6. <small>ZEBULUN</small> (<italic><small>ZBWLN</small></italic>) is the name of the Sanctuary (in I Kings 8:13): <small>I HAVE SURELY BUILT YOU A CELESTIAL</small> (<italic><small>ZBWL</small></italic>) <small>HOUSE</small>.</p>
<p>7. <small>DAN</small> (in Gen. 15:14): <small>BUT I AM ALSO JUDGING</small> (<italic>dan</italic>) <small>THE NATION WHICH THEY SHALL SERVE</small>.</p>
<p>8. <small>NAPHTALI</small> (<italic><small>NPTLY</small></italic>) (in Cant. 4:11): <small>YOUR LIPS DRIP NECTAR</small> (<italic><small>NPT</small></italic>), <small>O BRIDE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. <small>GAD</small> &#x003C;is mentioned&#x003E; in reference to the manna (in Numb. 11:7): <small>NOW THE MANNA WAS LIKE CORIANDER</small> (<italic>gad</italic>) <small>SEED</small>.</p>
<p>10. <small>ASHER</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>ShR</small></italic>) &#x003C;is mentioned&#x003E; in reference to the redemption (in Mal. 3:12): <small>ALL THE NATIONS SHALL ACCOUNT YOU HAPPY</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>ShR</small></italic>).</p>
<p>11. Joseph (in Is. 11:11, as part of a message of redemption for the northern tribes): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND</small> (<italic>yosif</italic>) <small>HIS HAND A SECOND TIME</small>.</p>
<p>12. <small>BENJAMIN</small> (<italic><small>BNYMN</small></italic>) (in Is. 62:8, with reference to the future redemption): <small>THE LORD HAS SWORN BY HIS RIGHT HAND</small> (<italic><small>BYMYN</small></italic>).</p>
<p>Ergo: All the names of the tribes have been mentioned &#x003C; elsewhere &#x003E; with reference to their redemption.</p>
<p>R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the Name of R. Levi: The names of the tribes are the same in every place, except that sometimes one takes precedence and sometimes another.<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> Why so? Lest the sons of the wives<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> (Leah and Rachel) be written first and the sons of the bondmaidens (Zilpah and Bilhah) written last. So why does one &#x003C;name&#x003E; sometimes take precedence and sometimes come later? To teach you that the former were not greater than the latter. Then why do some take precedence over others? Because they are the ceiling of the world, and whoever puts in a proper roof sets the top (i.e. the thin end) of one beam next to the top of the other.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> Some &#x003C; tribes &#x003E;, therefore, take precedence over others. And where is it shown that they are the ceiling (rt.: <italic><small>QRH</small></italic>) of the world? Where it is stated (in Is. 48:12): <small>LISTEN TO ME, O JACOB, EVEN ISRAEL, WHOM I HAVE CALLED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QR</small></italic>&#x2019;).</p>
<title>1.6 Exodus 1:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:6:) <small>THEN JOSEPH DIED, AND ALL HIS BROTHERS</small>. Although they had died, (according to vs. 7) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE FRUITFUL AND PROLIFIC</small>. R. Johanan said: Every woman of Israel bore sixty &#x003C; children &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> It is so stated (ibid.): <small>AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM</small>. R. Johanan said: They filled Egypt.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:7): <small>AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM</small>. Since the theater<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> houses and the circus<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> houses were filled with them; &#x003C;The Egyptians &#x003E; immediately decreed that they (the Israelites) should withdraw from the bed. So it was stated (ibid.): <small>AND THE LAND WAS FILLED WITH THEM</small>.</p>
<title>1.7 Exodus 1:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:8:) <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE OVER EGYPT</small>. R. Abba bar Kahana said: Was he &#x003C;really&#x003E; a new king? Only in the sense that he issued new decrees against them which &#x003C;led&#x003E; to tribulations.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE OVER EGYPT</small>. He was &#x003C; actually &#x003E; the former Pharaoh. It is simply that they said to him: Come and let us team up<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> against this people. He said to them: Up to now we have existed on what belongs to them. So are we to unite against them? Were it not for Joseph, these people (i.e., we ourselves) would have had no means (to exist) &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> So would you team up against them? Since he did not hearken to them, they immediately dethroned him for three months. When he saw that they had brought him down, he said to them: I will hearken to you in whatever you say. Ergo (in Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE</small> (after having been deposed for three months).</p>
<p>The prophet said (in Hos. 5:7): <small>THEY HAVE BETRAYED THE LORD BECAUSE THEY HAVE BORNE ALIEN CHILDREN</small>, in that they begot &#x003C;them&#x003E; without circumcising &#x003C;them&#x003E;. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOW THE NEW MOON</small> (<italic><small>HDSh</small></italic>, voweled as <italic>hodesh</italic>) <small>SHALL DEVOUR THEM. NEW</small> (<italic><small>HDSh</small></italic> voweled as <italic>hadash</italic>) is &#x003C;how the&#x003E; written text &#x003C;should be read&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> Ergo (in Exod. 1:8): <small>NOW A NEW KING AROSE &#x003C;OVER EGYPT</small> &#x003E;, <small>WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH</small>. Nor was he acquainted with Joseph, since it says: <small>WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH</small>. R. Abbin b. R., the Levite said: To what is the matter comparable? To someone who threw stones at a likeness<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> of a king, &#x003C;namely at&#x003E; a governor&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., his likeness&#x007D;. The king said: take him and cut off his head. Now he is doing such &#x003C;a thing&#x003E; to this &#x003C;governor&#x003E;; tomorrow he will do it me. So &#x003C;it was with&#x003E; Pharaoh. Now, &#x003C; Scripture says of him &#x003E; (in Exod. 1:8): <small>WHO DID NOT KNOW JOSEPH</small>; tomorrow, he would say (in Exod. 5:2): <small>I DO NOT KNOW THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>1.8 Exodus 1:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Exod. 1:9:) <small>AND HE</small> (Pharaoh) <small>SAID UNTO HIS PEOPLE: LOOK, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE TOO NUMEROUS AND TOO MIGHTY FOR US</small>. R. Meir said: From where did they become fruitful and numerous? From the <small>SOURCE</small>, as stated (in Ps. 68:27 [26]): <small>&#x003C;IN ASSEMBLIES BLESS GOD,&#x003E; THE LORD, &#x003C;YOU WHO ARE&#x003E; FROM THE SOURCE OF ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 1:10:) <small>COME, LET US</small> (Egyptians) <small>ACT SHREWDLY TOWARD THEM</small> (literally: <small>HIM</small>.)<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> &#x003C;Thus&#x003E; he blasphemed against the Most High.<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 1:10, cont.:) <small>LEST THEY MULTIPLY</small>. The Holy One said: You have said: <small>LEST</small> (<italic>pen</italic>) <small>&#x003C;THEY MULTIPLY&#x003E;</small>; so I am saying (in vs. 12): <small>&#x003C;BUT THE MORE THEY WERE OPPRESSED</small>, &#x003E; <small>THE MORE</small> (<italic>ken</italic>) <small>THEY MULTIPLIED, AND THE MORE</small> (<italic>ken</italic>) <small>THEY SPREAD ABROAD</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 1:10, cont.:) <small>AND IT WILL COME TO PASS THAT, WHEN A WAR OCCURS, THEY WILL BE ADDED TO OUR ENEMIES AND GO UP OUT OF THE LAND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> David said (in Ps. 44:26 [25]): <small>FOR OUR SOUL BOWS DOWN TO THE DUST</small>. At that time &#x003C;he said&#x003E; (in vs. 27 [26]): <small>ARISE, HELP US, AND REDEEM US FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.9 Exodus 3:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 3:1:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 103:7): <small>HE MADE HIS WAYS KNOWN TO MOSES</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> Why would he make known his ways to Moses? Because Moses knew all the ways of the Holy One, but no one else knew them. It is written (in Exod. 33:13): <small>AND NOW</small>, [&#x2026;,] <small>PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAYS KNOWN TO ME</small>. The Holy One said to him: Do you desire to stand upon my<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> ways? By your life, I will make &#x003C;them&#x003E; known to you. (Ps. 103:7): <small>HE MADE HIS WAYS KNOWN TO MOSES</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 103:7): <small>HE MADE HIS WAYS KNOWN TO MOSES</small>. The Holy One &#x003C;did so&#x003E; because he alone knew the final end of the captivity in Egypt. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 2:25): <small>GOD SAW THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND GOD KNEW</small>. To whom did he make known &#x003C;what he knew&#x003E;? To Moses, as stated (in what follows, i.e., Exod. 3:1ff.:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK</small>&#x2026;&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.10 Exodus 3:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 3:1:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK&#x003E;</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 11:4): <small>THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> R. Samuel bar Nahman said: Before the destruction of the Sanctuary, the Divine Presence was situated in the Temple, as stated (Ps. 11:4): <small>THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> but, after the Temple was destroyed, (ibid. cont.:) <small>THE LORD&#x2019;S THRONE IS IN THE HEAVENS</small>. He had removed his Divine Presence to the heavens. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: Whether the Temple is destroyed or not destroyed, the Divine Presence has not moved from its place, as stated (in Ps. 11:4): <small>THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE</small>. And where is it shown? Where it is stated (in I Kings 9:3): <small>MY EYES AND MY HEART SHALL BE THERE FOR ALL TIME</small>. It also says so (in Ps. 3:5 [4]): <small>I RAISE MY VOICE UNTO THE LORD, AND HE ANSWERS ME FROM HIS HOLY HILL. SELAH</small>. For even though it is &#x003C;only&#x003E; a hill,<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> here he remains in his holiness. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: See what is written (in Ezra 1:3): <small>AND LET HIM BUILD THE HOUSE OF THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL. HE IS THE GOD WHO IS IN JERUSALEM</small>. He has not moved from there. R. Aha said: The Divine Presence has never moved from the West Wall (i.e., the Wailing Wall) of the Sanctuary. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 2:9): <small>THERE HE STANDS BEHIND OUR WALL</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 11:4): <small>THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE</small>. R. Jannay said: Although they said (in Ps. 11:4): <small>THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE; THE LORD HAS HIS THRONE IN THE HEAVENS</small>; &#x003C; nevertheless &#x003E; (the verse continues), <small>HIS EYES BEHOLD, HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> and brought in the workers. Now by the orchard gate there was a certain storehouse full of everything good. The king said: Whoever does his work wholeheartedly will receive his reward from here, but whoever does not do his work wholeheartedly, him I shall return to my palace<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> and judge. Who is this king? This is the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. And what is the garden? It is this world. Within it the Holy One has put the children of Adam so that they may observe the Torah. But he has made a stipulation with them and said to them: For everyone who truly observes the Torah, here is paradise &#x003C; lying &#x003E; before him; but for everyone who does not truly observe the Torah, here is Gehinnom &#x003C; lying &#x003E; before him. The Holy One said: Although I seemed to have removed my Divine Presence from the Sanctuary, still (in Ps. 11:4): <small>MY EYES BEHOLD, &#x003C;MY EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small> &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> Whom does he test? (According to vs. 5:) <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. And why does he not test the wicked? R. Jannay said: When the flax worker is pounding away and sees that the flax is good, he pounds it a lot; but, when he sees that it is not good, he does not pound on it, lest it be spoiled.<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> Ergo (in Ps. 11:4:) <small>HIS EYES BEHOLD, HIS EYELIDS TEST THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. [And whom does he test? The righteous, as stated (in vs. 5):] <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. R. Isaac said: In what does he test the righteous? In the pasture. David was tested in the pasture, as stated (in Ps. 78:71): <small>HE BROUGHT HIM FROM FOLLOWING THE NURSING EWES TO SHEPHERD &#x003C;HIS PEOPLE JACOB, EVEN ISRAEL HIS INHERITANCE&#x003E;</small>. Amos was tested in the pasture, [as stated (in Amos 7:15):] <small>BUT THE LORD TOOK ME FROM FOLLOWING THE FLOCK</small>. Moses also was tested in the pasture. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 3:1:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.11 Exodus 3:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 2:16)? <small>NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS</small>. What is written there (in vs. 17)? <small>BUT THE SHEPHERDS CAME AND DROVE THEM OFF</small>. What did they do to them? They seized them in order to throw them in the water. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN MOSES ROSE UP AND SAVED</small> (a form of <italic>hoshia&#x2018;</italic>) <small>THEM</small>. Now this word (<italic>hoshia</italic>&#x2018;) is only &#x003C;used of&#x003E; a deliverance (rt.: <italic><small>NTsL</small></italic>) from water. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 69:2 [1]): <small>SAVE</small> (<italic>hoshia</italic>&#x2018;) <small>ME, O GOD, FOR THE WATERS HAVE REACHED MY NECK</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> (Exod. 2:17, cont.:) <small>AND HE WATERED THEIR FLOCK</small>. (Vs. 18:) <small>WHEN THEY CAME TO THEIR FATHER REUEL</small>. He was called by seven names: Jether, Jethro, Reuel, Hobab, [Heber,] Keni, Putiel.<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 2:18b-19:) <small>HE SAID: WHY HAVE YOU COME BACK SO SOON TODAY? AND THEY SAID: AN EGYPTIAN DELIVERED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTsL</small></italic>) <small>US FROM THE HAND OF THE SHEPHERDS</small>. Hence it follows that they had thrown them into the water. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE EVEN DREW US UP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 2:20:) <small>HE SAID UNTO HIS DAUGHTERS: SO WHERE IS HE</small>? Zipporah (<italic>Tsipporah</italic>) immediately &#x007B;went out&#x007D; [ran] like a bird (<italic>tsippor</italic>) and brought him. Another interpretation: Why was she called Zipporah (<italic>Tsipporah</italic>)? Because she cleansed her father&#x2019;s house like the blood of a bird (<italic>tsippor</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 2:21:) <small>THEN MOSES CONSENTED TO DWELL WITH THE MAN</small>. R. Judah asks: What is the meaning of <small>THEN &#x003C;MOSES&#x003E; CONSENTED</small> (<italic>wayyo&#x2019;el</italic>)? That he swore to him.<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> &#x003C;This usage is in accord with&#x003E; what is stated (in I Sam. 14:24): <small>FOR SAUL MADE THE PEOPLE SWEAR</small> (<italic>wayyo&#x2019;el</italic>). He agreed to live with him. Thus <small>CONSENTED</small> (<italic>wayyo&#x2019;el</italic>, rt.: <small>Y&#x2019;L</small>) is actually a word of lodging, &#x003C;in accord with&#x003E; what is stated (in Jud. 19:6): <small>SO NOW PLEASE CONSENT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>Y&#x2019;L</small></italic>) <small>TO STAY THE NIGHT</small>. (Exod. 2:21, cont.:) <small>AND HE GAVE MOSES HIS DAUGHTER ZIPPORAH</small>. When he took his daughter, he appointed him to tend his flock, as stated (in Exod. 3:1): <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING</small> (rt.: <small><italic>R&#x2019;H</italic></small>) <small>&#x003C;THE FLOCK OF HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHRO</small> &#x003E;. What is the meaning of <small>HE WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK&#x003E;</small>? R. Johanan said: In the case of everyone about whom it is stated: <small>HE WAS</small>, what <small>HE WAS</small> at his beginning, <small>HE WAS</small> at his end.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> He was worthy at his beginning and worthy at his end. The Rabbis say: Everyone<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> about whom it is stated: <small>HE WAS</small> nourished and sustained. They said to him: But look (at Gen. 3:1): <small>NOW THE SERPENT WAS THE MORE SUBTLE</small>. He said to them: He also was being prepared (by the word <small>WAS</small>) for divine punishment (in Gen. 3:14&#x2013;15). They said to him: But here it is written (in Gen. 4:2): <small>CAIN WAS A TILLER OF THE GROUND</small>. He said to them: He also was being prepared for exile. They said to him: And here it is written (in Jer. 38:28): <small>AND IT WAS WHEN JERUSALEM WAS CAPTURED</small>. He said to them: It was a good omen<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> for it; because, if Jerusalem had not been captured, Israel<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> would have been consumed. R. Levi has said: Everyone about whom it is stated: <small>HE WAS</small>, has seen a new age.<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> Ergo (in Exod. 3:1): <small>NOW MOSES WAS TENDING &#x003C;THE FLOCK</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>1.12 Exodus 3:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 3:1, cont.:) <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. Why was he seeking <small>THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>? In order to keep himself far away from despoiling (the pasturage of others).<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> Another interpretation: He sought the desert because he saw that he would receive greatness from the desert.<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> Torah came from the desert; commandments came from the desert; a tabernacle came from the desert; the Divine Presence came from the desert; kingdoms and priesthood came from the desert; the well came from the desert; the manna came from the desert; clouds of glory came from the desert. For that reason he sought <small>THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 3:1, cont.:) <small>AND HE CAME TO HOREB, THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD</small>. R. Simeon ben Jose ben Leqonya said: Moses&#x2019; flock went forty days without eating and without tasting anything, just as Elijah, of blessed memory, did. [It is so stated (in I Kings 19:8): <small>ARISING, HE ATE AND DRANK. THEN ON THE STRENGTH OF THAT FOOD HE WENT FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS UNTO HOREB, THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD</small>.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 3:1): <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. R. Joshua ben Qorhah said: &#x003C;The Holy One&#x003E; portended to him that his flock (the Israelites) would perish in the desert and that he would be removed (i.e., die) along with them. (Exod. 3:1:) <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK</small>. &#x003C;Thereby the Holy One&#x003E; was hinting to him that he would drive the children of Israel forty years. Then after that he would be removed. So also in the case of Moses, when he sought the needs of Israel. When the Holy One, blessed be he, said to him: Go on my mission, Moses said to him (in Cant. 1:7): <small>TELL ME, YOU WHOM MY SOUL LOVES, WHERE DO YOU TEND &#x003C;YOUR FLOCK</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;? How many midwives are there among them? How many are pregnant among them? How many ointments have you prepared for the pregnant ones who are among them? <small>TELL ME, YOU WHOM MY SOUL LOVES</small>. The Holy One answered and said to him (in Cant. 1:8): <small>IF YOU DO NOT KNOW, O FAIREST AMONG WOMEN, COME OUT IN THE TRACKS OF THE FLOCK</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Exod. 3:1): <small>SO HE DROVE THE FLOCK TO THE FARTHEST END OF THE DESERT</small>. When he reached Horeb, what is immediately written (in vs. 2)? <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD APPEARED UNTO HIM IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>. Why <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>? In order to attract him. When he came to Sinai and saw that fire, he would be awe-struck.<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> Ergo: <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>. Another interpretation: Why <small>IN A FLAME OF FIRE</small>? Because a flame is given from two thirds.<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> Why <small>FROM THE MIDST OF A THORN BUSH</small> and not from the midst of another tree? The Holy One said (in Ps. 91:15): <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small>. Now they (the Israelites) were placed in the &#x003C; thorns of&#x003E; slavery; so shall I be revealed from the midst of another tree? Therefore, &#x003C;I was revealed&#x003E; (in Exod. 3:2): <small>FROM THE MIDST OF A THORN BUSH</small>, because it is all thorns.</p>
<title>1.13 Exodus 3:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 3:3:) <small>SO MOSES SAID: I MUST TURN ASIDE TO LOOK</small>. R. Johanan said: Moses walked three steps.<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> Resh Laqish said: he did not walk but merely twisted his neck (to look). The Holy One said to him: You took the trouble to look. By your life I will appear to you. Immediately (in Exod. 3:4): <small>GOD CALLED UNTO HIM FROM THE MIDST OF THE THORN BUSH AND SAID: MOSES, MOSES&#x0021; AND HE SAID: HERE I AM</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have said: <small>HERE I AM</small>. By your life, the hour will come when you will say a prayer over Israel, and I will immediately answer you &#x003C;with these words&#x003E;. It is so stated (in Is. 58:9): <small>THEN, WHEN YOU CALL, THE LORD SHALL ANSWER; WHEN YOU CRY FOR HELP, HE SHALL SAY: HERE I AM</small>.</p>
<title>1.14 Exodus 4:18ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 4:18:) <small>THEN MOSES WENT AND RETURNED UNTO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHER</small> (i.e., Jethro). This text is related (to Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. R. Papias interpreted &#x003C;the verse as follows &#x003E;: Because he stands alone in his world, there is no one to interfere with him. Whatever he wants to do, he does, as stated (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> R. Aqiva said to him: Enough from you, Papias&#x0021; One does not so interpret. What is the meaning of (Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM</small>? Just like the one who petitions &#x003C;here&#x003E; below, so is one who petitions above. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Dan. 4:14 [17]): <small>THE RULING IS BY THE DECREE OF THE WATCHERS, AND THE PETITION</small> &#x007B;<small>BY</small>&#x007D; <small>THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONES &#x003C; SO THAT THE LIVING MAY KNOW THAT THE MOST HIGH IS SOVEREIGN OVER THE HUMAN REALM</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. Just as one argues <italic>halakhah</italic> &#x003C;here&#x003E; below, so it is above. So everything &#x003C;proceeds&#x003E; with justice. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 10:21): <small>BUT I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH; &#x003C;FOR NO ONE IS STANDING BY ME AGAINST THESE</small> (i.e., against Persia and Greece) <small>EXCEPT YOUR PRINCE MICHAEL&#x003E;</small>. When the Holy One argues a case, he says: how did the judgment of such a person come out? And they say: It came out this way. Then the Holy One agrees with them. From whom have you learned &#x003C;this custom &#x003E;? From Micaiah. See what is written (in I Kings 22:19): <small>BUT</small> &#x007B;<small>MICAIAH</small>&#x007D; <small>SAID: HEAR, THEREFORE, THE WORD OF THE LORD: I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left above, as it says: <small>TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>? It is simply that the ones on the right tip the balance toward the side of merit, and the ones on the left tip the balance toward the side of guilt. Ergo, everything &#x003C;proceeds&#x003E; with justice. So why is it that (in Job 23:13) <small>HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM</small>? Because he alone in his world has knowledge of his creatures.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 23:13): <small>BUT HE HAS ONENESS; SO WHO CAN TURN HIM? &#x003C;AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES&#x003E;</small>. Because he stands alone in his world, no one refutes his words. Look at how much Jonah resisted going on his mission; yet it is stated (in Jonah 3:3): <small>THEN JONAH AROSE AND WENT UNTO NINEVEH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LORD&#x2019;S COMMAND</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Jeremiah said to the Holy One (in Jer. 1:6): <small>I AM &#x003C;BUT&#x003E; A LAD</small>, the Holy One said to him (in vs. 7): <small>DO NOT SAY: I AM &#x003C;BUT&#x003E; A LAD; FOR, WHEREVER I SEND YOU, YOU SHALL GO</small>&#x2026;. He did not budge until he went on the mission of the Holy One. Ergo (in Job 23:13): <small>AND WHATEVER HIS SOUL DESIRES, HE DOES</small>. In the case of Moses also: When the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): <small>COME, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>, Moses said (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. The Holy One had said to him: I am saying to you: <small>COME, I WILL SEND YOU</small>; but you say: <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. Let us see whose &#x003C;will&#x003E; prevails. He did not budge until he <italic>went</italic> (on his mission), as stated (in Exod. 4:18): <small>THEN MOSES WENT</small> (on his mission) <small>AND</small> (afterwards) <small>RETURNED UNTO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHER</small> (i.e., Jethro).<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.15 Exodus 4:18ff., Part II</title>
<p>What is written above of the matter (in Exod. 3:4)? <small>WHEN THE LORD SAW THAT HE HAD TURNED ASIDE TO LOOK, GOD CALLED UNTO HIM FROM THE MIDST OF THE THORN BUSH AND SAID: MOSES, MOSES</small>&#x0021; R. Abba bar Kahana said: Everyone whose name is doubled has a share in both worlds (i.e., this world and the world to come):<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> <small>NOAH, NOAH</small> (in Gen. 6:9); <small>ABRAHAM, ABRAHAM</small> (in Gen. 22:11); <small>JACOB, JACOB</small> (in Gen. 46:2); <small>MOSES, MOSES</small> (in Exod. 3:4); <small>SAMUEL, SAMUEL</small> (in I Sam. 3:10); and the text <small>TERAH, TERAH</small> (in Gen. 11:27). He said to them: Terah also is to have a share in both worlds, for our father Abraham did not die until he had received the good news about the fact that his father Terah had repented, as stated (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE</small>. &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; said to him: Should I go to my ancestors with whatever good works you have saved up for him?<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> At that time the Holy One brought the good news and said to him: By your life, your father Terah has repented. His name is therefore doubled (in Gen. 11:27).</p>
<title>1.16 Exodus 4:18ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 3:4, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID: HERE I AM</small>. R. Joshua ben Qorhah said: What is the meaning of <small>HERE I AM, HERE I AM? HERE I AM</small> for priesthood, &#x003C;and&#x003E; <small>HERE I AM</small> for kingship.<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him &#x007B;where he stood&#x007D;: You are standing &#x007B;in as&#x007D; [in place of] the pillar of the world. Abraham said (in Gen. 22:1 &#x0026; 11): <small>HERE I AM</small>; now you have said: <small>HERE I AM</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 3:5:) <small>AND HE SAID: DO NOT COME NEAR HERE. REMOVE YOUR SANDALS FROM YOUR FEET</small>&#x2026;. It is written with reference to Joshua (in Josh. 5:15): <small>REMOVE YOUR SANDALS</small>, and it is written with reference to Moses (in Exod. 3:5): <small>REMOVE YOUR SANDALS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 3:6:) <small>HE ALSO SAID: I AM THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER</small>. He revealed himself to him in the voice of his father Amram so that he would not be afraid.<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> At that time Moses rejoiced and said: My father Amram is [alive]. The Holy One said to him: You have said that I am your father, but I am actually <small>THE GOD OF YOUR FATHER</small>. At that time (ibid., cont.): <small>MOSES HID HIS FACE, &#x003C;FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT GOD&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you have paid me an honor; I am paying you an honor, as stated (in Exod. 34:35): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WOULD SEE MOSES&#x2019; FACE, &#x003C;THAT THE SKIN OF MOSES&#x2019; FACE WAS RADIANT WITH LIGHT&#x003E;</small>. You were afraid, &#x003C;as stated&#x003E; (in Exod. 3:6, cont.): <small>FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK &#x003C;AT GOD&#x003E;</small>. By your life, I am doing &#x003C;for you&#x003E; as it says &#x003C;you did for me&#x003E;. &#x003C;Thus&#x003E; (in Exod. 34:30): <small>AND THEY WERE AFRAID OF APPROACHING HIM</small>. By virtue (in Exod. 3:6) of &#x003C;his being <small>AFRAID&#x003E; TO LOOK</small> (<small>HBYT</small>), (in Numb. 12:8) <small>HE BEHOLDS</small> (from <small>HBYT</small>) <small>THE LIKENESS OF THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.17 Exodus 4:18ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 3:9:) <small>BUT NOW LOOK, THE CRY OF ISRAEL&#x2019;S CHILDREN HAS COME UNTO ME, AND I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE OPPRESSION &#x003C; WITH WHICH THE EGYPTIANS OPPRESS THEM</small> &#x003E;. &#x003C;This verse &#x003E; teaches that the Holy One looked at the Egyptians, at how they had enslaved Israel. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>LOOK, THE CRY OF ISRAEL&#x2019;S CHILDREN HAS COME UNTO ME, AND I HAVE ALSO SEEN THE OPPRESSION</small>&#x2026;. I, as it were, am with them. <small>&#x003C;As for THE OPPRESSION &#x003E; WITH WHICH THE EGYPTIANS OPPRESS THEM</small>, (according to vs. 8) <small>I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM &#x003C;OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 3:10:) <small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>. R. Eleazar says: &#x003C;The passage should be read with different vowels to mean: &#x003E; <small>SO NOW FOR YOU. FOR YOU</small> has Israel awaited; <small>FOR YOU</small> has Israel hoped. <small>SO NOW FOR YOU. FOR YOU</small> there is greatness in this thing. R. Johanan said: [The Holy One said:] <small>FOR YOU</small> is this message passed on.</p>
<title>1.18 Exodus 4:18ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 4:10:) <small>THEN MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: PRAY</small> (<italic>bi</italic>), <small>LORD</small>. You are doing me wrong (<italic>biyah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; my brother Aaron is older than I, are you sending me? (Ibid.:) <small>&#x003C;THIS DOES ME &#x003E; WRONG</small> (<italic>bi</italic>), <small>LORD, I AM NOT A MAN OF WORDS</small>. The Holy One said to him (in Exod. 4:11): <small>WHO HAS MADE THE HUMAN MOUTH</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 4:12:) <small>SO GO NOW, AND I WILL BE WITH YOUR MOUTH</small>&#x2026;. R. Judah b. R. Simon said: The Holy One [said] to Moses: I am making you into a new creature, as in the case of a woman who conceives (<italic>horah</italic>) and gives birth. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND TEACH</small> (<italic>horah</italic>) <small>YOU WHAT TO SAY</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: The Holy One said to Moses: I am shooting (rt.: <small>YRH</small>) my words into your mouth like an arrow. Now <small>TEACH</small> (rt.: <small>YRH</small>) is actually a word &#x003C;meaning &#x201C;shoot&#x201D;&#x003E; (as found in Exod. 19:13): <small>&#x003C;HE SHALL SURELY BE STONED OR&#x003E; SHOT</small> (rt.: <small>YRH</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> As soon as the Holy One gave him the good news that he was with him, he immediately took it upon himself to go. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:18) <small>THEN MOSES WENT AND RETURNED &#x003C;TO HIS FATHER-IN-LAW JETHER</small> (i.e., Jethro) &#x003E;. Now, it should merely have said: &#x201C;And he returned unto Egypt.&#x201D; So why did he return unto his father-in-law, Jethro? In order to cancel a vow.<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> Thus he said to the Holy One: I have sworn to Jethro (not to leave him without permission). He went to Jethro. What did the Holy One do? He set a cloud over him<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> (as a sign of divine protection).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 4:18): <small>THEN MOSES WENT AND RETURNED</small> in order to get permission from him.</p>
<p>(Exod. 4:18, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID TO HIM: PLEASE LET ME GO AND RETURN TO MY KINSFOLK &#x003C;IN EGYPT AND SEE WHETHER THEY ARE STILL ALIVE. AND JETHRO SAID TO MOSES</small>: &#x003E; [<small>GO FOR PEACE</small>]. Everyone of whom it is written, <small>FOR PEACE</small>, goes and returns; but everyone of whom it is written, <small>GO IN PEACE</small>, goes and does not return.<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> Concerning Abner it is written (in II Sam. 3:21): <small>AND DAVID AWAY SENT ABNER, WHO WENT IN PEACE</small>.

<p>(Exod. 4:21:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WHEN YOU GO TO RETURN TO EGYPT</small>. The Holy One showed him the miracles that he was going to do for him. Now he had said to him (Exod. 3:16:): <small>GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>,&#x2026; and afterwards you are going to Pharaoh. Moses said: If they should say <small>TO ME</small> (in Exod. 3:13), <small>WHAT IS HIS NAME, WHAT DO I SAY TO THEM</small>? He said to him: Say to them (in vs. 14): <small>I AM THAT I AM</small>.</p>

<p>He said to him: You have uttered slander against my children. Just as, when the serpent uttered slander (in Gen. 3:4&#x2013;5), I afflicted him with leprosy;<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> so also with you (in Exod. 4:6): <small>PLEASE PUT YOUR HAND IN YOUR BOSOM.

The Holy One said to him: You say of my children that they will not believe; yet they are believing children of believers. (Exod. 4:9:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF THEY DO NOT EVEN BELIEVE THESE TWO SIGNS</small>: The Holy One gave him a hint. He said to him: From where do you get yours (i.e., your sentence for your unbelief in vs. 1)? From the water, as stated (in vs. 9, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL TAKE SOME WATER FROM THE NILE</small>.</p>

<p>(Exod. 4:29): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED &#x003C;ALL THE ELDERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> &#x003E;. He said to them: Thus did the Holy One say (in Exod. 3:16): <small>I HAVE SURELY THOUGHT OF YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> It was a sign<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> for Israel. When any redeemer would come with this sign, <small>I HAVE SURELY THOUGHT OF &#x003C;YOU&#x003E;</small>, they would know that he was a true redeemer. Thus had Joseph told them (in Gen. 50:24): <small>GOD WILL SURELY THINK OF YOU</small>. When &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; (as instructed in Exod. 3:16) mentioned to them &#x003C;the words &#x003E;, &#x201C;will surely think of,&#x201D; immediately (according to Exod. 4:31) <small>THE PEOPLE BELIEVED</small>. When Moses and Aaron said to them: Come with us to Pharaoh, the elders of Israel immediately took it upon themselves to go with them.</p>

The Holy One said to them: What do you think? That I am not going to repay you? By your life, when Moses and Aaron go to receive the Torah, you are going up with them, but I am turning you back. It is so stated (in Exod. 24:14): <small>BUT UNTO THE ELDERS HE HAD SAID: TURN BACK HERE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup> The Holy one said to them: In this world you have not seen the glory of Torah, but in the world to come you shall be glorified in &#x003C;the glory&#x003E; of Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn100">100</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Is. 24:23): <small>THEN THE MOON SHALL BE ASHAMED, AND THE SUN SHALL BE ABASHED, FOR THE LORD OF HOSTS SHALL REIGN ON MOUNT ZION AND IN JERUSALEM.

<p>(Exod. 4:27:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO AARON: GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>This text is related (to Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE; &#x003C;HE DOES GREAT THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THUNDERS</small>? It is simply that, when the Holy One gave the Torah on Sinai, the Holy One through his voice showed Israel miracle after miracle. How? When the Holy One spoke, his voice went back and forth throughout all the world. When Israel heard the voice, it came from the south; so they ran &#x007B;from the south&#x007D; [southward] to receive the voice &#x003C;coming&#x003E; from there. And so it was for &#x003C;all&#x003E; the four winds.<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> After that it shifted &#x003C;so that it came&#x003E; to them from the heavens; so they were raising their eyes to the heavens. Then the voice shifted &#x003C;so that it came&#x003E; to them from the ground. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Deut. 4:36): <small>FROM THE HEAVENS HE HAD YOU HEAR HIS VOICE ADMONISH YOU. ON EARTH HE SHOWED YOU HIS GREAT FIRE, &#x003C;AND FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE YOU HEARD HIS WORDS&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Now the Israelites were saying to each other (in Job 28:20): <small>BUT WHERE IS WISDOM FOUND</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn103">103</xref></sup> <small>AND WHERE IS THE PLACE OF UNDERSTANDING</small>?</p>
<p>(Exod. 20:15 [18]:) <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS</small> (literally: <small>VOICES</small>). What is the meaning of <small>THE VOICES</small> (in the plural)? It was simply that the &#x003C;one divine &#x003E; voice was transformed into seven voices and &#x003C;then&#x003E; from seven into seventy tongues.<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> And why into seventy tongues? So that all the nations would hear. But, when the voice went forth, each and every nation heard the voice of the Holy One, and each one&#x2019;s soul departed; but Israel was not harmed. How [did the voice go forth. R. Tanhuma said:] The voice went forth and killed nations &#x007B;so that they would accept&#x007D; [because they did not accept] the Torah, but &#x003C;the voice &#x003E; gave life to Israel &#x007B;so that they would accept&#x007D; [because they accepted] the Torah. That is what Moses said to them at the end of forty years (in Deut. 5:23 [26]): <small>FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH THAT HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD SPEAKING FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED</small>? He also says (in Deut. 4:33): <small>HAS ANY PEOPLE HEARD THE VOICE OF GOD &#x003C;SPEAKING FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS YOU HAVE HEARD, AND LIVED</small> &#x003E;? You have heard it and &#x003C; still &#x003E; live, but the nations heard it and died. Come and see how the voice went forth to Israel. Each and every person heard according to his ability (<italic>koah):</italic> the old ones according to their ability, the youths according to their ability, the lads, the small ones, the babies, the infants according to their ability, and even Moses according to his ability. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:19): <small>MOSES SPOKE, AND GOD ANSWERED HIM OUT LOUD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>OUT LOUD</small> (literally: <small>IN A VOICE</small>)? Merely <small>IN A VOICE</small> which Moses was able to endure. And so it says (in Ps. 29:4): <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS IN POWER</small> (<italic>koah</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; within the ability (<italic>koah</italic>) of each and everyone, the pregnant women according to their ability and all &#x003C; others &#x003E; according to their ability. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: If you are surprised about it, learn from the manna.<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>For it came down for each and every one only according to his need. The youths ate it as bread, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. The old ones ate it as honey, as stated (in Exod. 16:31): <small>AND ITS TASTE WAS LIKE WAFERS IN HONEY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn106">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the small ones it was like milk from their mother&#x2019;s breast, as stated (in Numb. 11:8): <small>AND ITS TASTE WAS LIKE THE TASTE OF FAT CREAM</small>. And the sick savored it as the taste of fine flour mixed with oil and honey like barley grits<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> as one prepares it for the sick {<italic>fankokha</italic>&#x2019; in the Arabic language&#x007D;. It is so stated (ibid.): <small>BOILED IT IN A POT</small>. It also says (in Ezek. 16:19): <small>ALSO MY BREAD, WHICH I GAVE YOU, FINE FLOUR</small>, [<small>OIL</small>], <small>AND HONEY, WHICH I HAD YOU EAT</small>. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: If the manna, which was one species, was changed into several varieties and into many species because of Israel&#x2019;s need, how much the more so in the case of the voice in which was &#x003C; uttered &#x003E; with power (<italic>koah</italic>). Ergo (in Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.23 Exodus 4:27ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>; <small>&#x003C;HE DOES GREAT THINGS WHICH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND&#x003E;</small>. When did the Holy One do marvels with his voice?<sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup> When the Holy One desired to send Moses on his mission to redeem Israel, he was in Midian &#x003C;and&#x003E; afraid of Pharaoh from whom he had fled lest he kill him. It is so stated (in Exod. 2:15): <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH</small>&#x2026;. When the oracle was revealed to him in Midian and told him to return to Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 4:19): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES IN MIDIAN: GO BACK TO EGYPT</small>, the oracle was divided into two voices and became two faces.<sup><xref rid="fn109">109</xref></sup> In Midian Moses heard (according to Exod. 4:19): <small>GO BACK TO EGYPT</small>, while in Egypt Aaron heard (according to Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. But whoever was in the middle did not hear anything. Ergo (in Job 37:5): <small>GOD THUNDERS MARVELOUSLY WITH HIS VOICE</small>.</p>
<title>1.24 Exodus 4:27ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 8:1): <small>IF ONLY YOU COULD BE TO ME LIKE A BROTHER</small>. Israel is saying to the Holy One: <small>IF ONLY YOU COULD BE TO ME LIKE A BROTHER</small>. Like which brother?<sup><xref rid="fn110">110</xref></sup> You find that from the beginning of the creation of the world until now brothers have hated each other. Cain hated Abel and killed him, as stated (in Gen. 4:8): <small>CAIN AROSE AGAINST HIS BROTHER ABEL AND MURDERED HIM</small>. Ishmael hated Isaac (rt.: <small><italic>Ts</italic>HQ</small>), as stated (in Gen. 21:9): <small>WHEN SARAH SAW THE SON WHOM HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN HAD BORNE TO ABRAHAM PLAYING</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Ts</italic>HQ</small>). Now <small>PLAYING</small> can only mean that he desired to kill him, as stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY BEFORE US</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn111">111</xref></sup> Esau also hated Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:41): <small>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART</small>: <small>&#x003C;LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&#x003E;</small>. Moreover, the tribes hated Joseph, as stated (in Gen. 37:4): <small>THEY HATED HIM</small>. So like which brother? Israel said: Like Moses and Aaron, as stated (in Ps. 133:1): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND HOW PLEASANT IT IS &#x003C;FOR KINDRED TO DWELL TOGETHER&#x003E;</small>, since they loved each other and cherished each other. Thus when Moses received the kingship and Aaron &#x003C; received &#x003E; the high priesthood, they were not jealous of each other. Rather they were happy in each other&#x2019;s greatness.<sup><xref rid="fn112">112</xref></sup> You know yourself it to be so. You find that, when the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 3:10): <small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>&#x2026;, Moses said to him (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE &#x003C; SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT&#x003E;</small>. Do you imagine that Moses may have delayed in order not to go? He only acted out of respect for Aaron. Moses said: Before I arose, Aaron had been prophesying to them for eighty years. He &#x003C;is the one&#x003E; of whom it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5): <small>I MADE MYSELF KNOWN TO THEM IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. And where is it shown that Aaron prophesied to them? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 2:27&#x2013;28): <small>NOW A MAN OF GOD CAME UNTO ELI AND SAID UNTO HIM: THUS SAYS THE LORD: I SURELY REVEALED MYSELF</small> &#x007B;<small>TO</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>YOUR FATHER&#x2019;S HOUSE IN EGYPT, WHEN THEY BELONGED TO PHARAOH&#x2019;S HOUSE; AND I CHOSE HIM FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn113">113</xref></sup> He said to him: All these years Aaron has prophesied to them. So am I now to go to them in my brother&#x2019;s domain so that he will be upset? For that reason Moses did not desire to go. The Holy One said to him: Your brother Aaron will not be upset over this matter. Rather he will be happy. You yourself know that he is going out for a meeting<sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup> with you. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:14): <small>SEE, HE IS SETTING OUT TO MEET YOU; AND WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>: not in his mouth alone but in his heart, his heart more than his mouth. <small>WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: The heart that was happy at his brother&#x2019;s greatness shall put on Urim and Thummim, as stated (in Exod. 28:30): <small>AND INSIDE THE BREAST PLATE OF JUDGMENT YOU SHALL PUT THE URIM AND THUMMIM SO THAT THEY SHALL BE UPON AARON&#x2019;S HEART</small>. Ergo (In Exod. 4:14): <small>AND ALSO SEE, HE IS SETTING OUT TO MEET YOU; AND WHEN HE SEES YOU, HE WILL BE HAPPY IN HIS HEART</small>. When &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; had said this to him, &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; took it upon himself to go. Immediately the Holy One revealed himself to Aaron. He said to him: Go out to meet your brother Moses so that he may know that you are happy over the matter. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 8:1): <small>IF ONLY YOU COULD BE TO ME LIKE A BROTHER</small>, like Moses and Aaron who loved each other. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IF I MET YOU OUTSIDE, I WOULD KISS YOU</small>. (Exod. 4:27:) <small>SO HE WENT TO MEET HIM ON THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD AND KISSED HIM</small>.</p>
<title>1.25 Exodus 4:27ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 4:27): <small>GO INTO THE DESERT TO MEET MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 85:11 [10]): <small>FAITHFULNESS AND TRUTH MEET; RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE KISS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn115">115</xref></sup> <small>RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>: This is Moses, &#x003C;of whom&#x003E; it is stated (in Deut. 33:21): <small>HE CARRIED OUT THE LORD&#x2019;S RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn116">116</xref></sup> <small>PEACE</small>: This is Aaron, of whom it is stated (in Mal. 2:6): <small>IN PEACE AND UPRIGHTNESS HE WALKED WITH ME. FAITHFULNESS</small>: This is Aaron, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 33:8): <small>AND OF LEVI HE SAID: LET YOUR THUMMIM AND URIM BE WITH YOUR FAITHFUL ONE. AND TRUTH</small> (&#x2018;<small>MT</small>): This is Moses, of whom it is stated (of Moses in Numb. 12:7): <small>HE IS TRUSTED</small> (rt.: 7<small>MN</small>) <small>IN ALL MY HOUSE</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 85:11 [10]): <small>FAITHFULNESS AND TRUTH MEET</small>. (Exod. 4:27): <small>SO HE</small> (Aaron) <small>WENT TO MEET HIM</small> (Moses) <small>&#x003C;ON THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD&#x003E;</small>. (Ps. 85:11 [10], cont.): <small>RIGHTEOUSNESS AND PEACE KISS</small>. (Exod. 4:27, cont.): <small>AND KISSED HIM</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 4:27): <small>AND KISSED HIM</small>. All kisses are indecent except three, and these are the following: the kiss of departure, the kiss of greatness, and the kiss of reunion (literally: of crossroads).<sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup> The kiss of departure &#x003C;is not silly&#x003E; because it is stated (in Ruth 1:14): <small>AND ORPAH KISSED HER MOTHER-IN-LAW</small>; the kiss of greatness, because it is stated (in I Sam. 10:1): <small>THEN SAMUEL TOOK THE FLASK OF OIL, POURED IT UPON HIS HEAD, AND KISSED HIM</small>&#x2026;.; the kiss of reunion, because it is stated (in Exod. 4:27): <small>SO HE WENT TO MEET HIM &#x003C;ON THE MOUNTAIN OF GOD&#x003E; AND KISSED HIM</small>.</p>
<title>1.26 Exodus 4:27ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 4:28:) <small>AND MOSES TOLD AARON ALL THE WORDS OF THE LORD WITH WHICH HE HAD SENT HIM</small>. Moses began telling him everything which the Holy One had told him, how he would go and how he would perform all the signs.<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> As soon as they went, they made harmony with the elders, as stated (in Exod. 4:29): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED &#x003C;ALL THE ELDERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> &#x003E;. The elders have always supported Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn119">119</xref></sup> and so it says (in Josh. 8:33): <small>AND ALL ISRAEL, THEIR ELDERS</small>, &#x007B;<small>THEIR</small>&#x007D; <small>OFFICERS, AND THEIR JUDGES, STOOD ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ARK</small>. When does Israel stand? When they have elders. Why? While the Temple existed, they were in consultation with the elders, as stated (in Deut. 32:7): <small>ASK YOUR FATHER AND HE WILL INFORM YOU; YOUR ELDERS, AND THEY WILL TELL YOU</small>. When anyone takes advice from the elders, then person is to be commended. You yourself know that, when Ben-hadad sent to the king of Israel and said to him (in I Kings 20:3): <small>THUS SAYS BEN-HADAD: YOUR SILVER AND GOLD ARE MINE</small>; <small>&#x003C;YOUR BEAUTIFUL WIVES AND CHILDREN ARE MINE&#x003E;</small>, the king of Israel sent to him &#x003C;and said&#x003E; (in vs. 4): <small>AS YOU SAY, MY LORD KING, I AND ALL THAT I HAVE ARE YOURS</small>. He sent to him a second time (in vs. 6): <small>NEVERTHELESS TOMORROW ABOUT THIS TIME I WILL SEND MY SERVANTS TO YOU; AND THEY WILL SEARCH &#x003C;YOUR HOUSE AND THE HOUSES OF YOUR SERVANTS</small> &#x003E;, <small>LAY THEIR HANDS UPON EVERYTHING YOUR EYES DELIGHT IN, AND TAKE IT AWAY</small>. [Was not] whatever he originally demanded &#x007B;was not&#x007D; a delight[?] He sought silver and gold, and they are a delight, as stated (in Hag. 2:7&#x2013;8): <small>AND THE DELIGHT OF ALL THE NATIONS SHALL COME, &#x003C;AND I WILL FILL THIS HOUSE WITH GLORY, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS. &#x003E; THE SILVER IS MINE, AND THE GOLD IS MINE</small>. He sought women, and they are a delight, as stated (in Ezek. 24:16): <small>SON OF ADAM, SEE, I AM TAKING AWAY</small> [<small>FROM YOU</small>] <small>THE DELIGHT OF YOUR EYES</small> (i.e., your wife) <small>THROUGH PESTILENCE</small>. [He sought] children, and they are a delight, as stated (in Hos. 9:16): <small>AND I WILL PUT TO DEATH THE DELIGHTS OF THEIR WOMB</small>. Ergo: Whatever he originally demanded was a delight. Then what is the meaning (in I Kings 20:4) of <small>EVERYTHING YOUR EYES DELIGHT IN</small>? Something more delightful than &#x003C;any&#x003E; delight, i.e., the Torah, as stated (concerning the judgments of the Holy One in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small>. When the king of Israel heard this, he said: This is not a matter for me but for the elders. Immediately (in I Kings 20:7&#x2013;8): <small>THEN THE KING OF ISRAEL CALLED</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR</small>] <small>ALL THE ELDERS OF THE LAND AND SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>TO THEM</small>&#x007D;: <small>PLEASE COMPREHEND AND SEE HOW THIS MAN IS SEEKING EVIL; &#x003C;FOR, WHEN HE SENT UNTO ME FOR MY WIVES, MY CHILDREN, MY SILVER, AND MY GOLD, I DID NOT REFUSE HIM. SO</small> [<small>ALL</small>] <small>THE ELDERS AND ALL THE PEOPLE SAID UNTO HIM</small>: &#x007B;<small>NEVER</small>&#x007D; [<small>DO NOT</small>] <small>HEED AND NEVER CONSENT</small>. When he heard the advice of the elders, he arose. <small>THEN</small> (according to I Kings 20:21), <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL WENT OUT AND SMOTE THE HORSES</small>&#x2026;. Ergo: They always consulted with the elders. So also Moses (in Exod. 19:7) <small>SUMMONED THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>, and afterwards, the leaders and the judges. When did Israel have leaders? When they had elders. So here also (in Exod. 4:29): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON WENT AND GATHERED ALL THE ELDERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. What is the meaning of <small>GATHERED</small>? That they appointed them as elders, just as the Holy One had told him (in Exod. 3:16): <small>GO AND GATHER</small> (i.e., appoint) <small>THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn120">120</xref></sup> The Holy One has said: In this world I have distributed glory to the elders; and in the age to come I am also sharing glory with them, as stated (in Is. 24:23): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE DIVINE&#x003E; GLORY &#x003C;SHALL STAND&#x003E; IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ELDERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn121">121</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn67">67.

<ftnote id="fn81">81. This wording, which puts &#x201C;God&#x201D; first in the sentence, does not agree with the Septuagint, which follows the Masoretic Text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn82">82. The only difference from the Masoretic Text is that &#x201C;them&#x201D; is expressed as a verbal suffix instead of as a separate word, nor does the Septuagint make any change. The <italic>Tanhuma</italic> parallel has &#x201C;created him.&#x201D; Other parallels (e.g., the <italic>Mekhilta</italic>) read: &#x201C;A male and his female parts he created him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn83">83. The emendation agrees with the Septuagint and avoids the suggestion that, by finishing on the seventh day, the Holy One worked on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn84">84. The Masoretic Text here reads: &#x201C;<small>THEN GOD CREATED THE HUMAN IN HIS IMAGE, IN THE IMAGE OF GOD HE CREATED HIM</small>.&#x201D; The Septuagint follows the Masoretic Text in affirming the divine nature of the human image but alters the text to read: &#x201C;God made the human, according to the image of God he made him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn85">85. Again unlike the Septuagint as well as the Masoretic Text, this passage stresses the oneness of the Holy One by changing &#x201C;us&#x201D; to &#x201C;me.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn86">86. Against both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, the emendation clears Simeon and Levi of homicide.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn87">87. Thus the emendation avoids the indignity of having Moses&#x2019; family ride on an ass.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn88">88. The emendation tends to agree with the Septuagint, which reads: &#x201C;in Egypt and in the land of Canaan,&#x201D; over against the Masoretic Text, which simply reads: &#x201C;<small>IN EGYPT</small>.&#x201D; Cf. the parallels in <italic>Tanhuma</italic> and in <italic>Mekhilta</italic>, which add &#x201C;the land of Goshen&#x201D; to Egypt and Canaan. The reason for the additions is that the Biblical record indicates elsewhere that Israel must have spent far less than four hundred years in Egypt. See Rashi on Exod. 12:40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn89">89. Both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint omit &#x201C;to give light.&#x201D; Without these words, one might understand the verse to mean that, while Israel was forbidden to bow down to the heavenly host, they were allotted to other peoples as lesser deities.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn90">90. Both the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint omit &#x201C;those who serve them.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn91">91. The Septuagint has &#x201C;hare&#x201D; here, but the Greek word used (<italic>dasupous</italic>) has the literal meaning, &#x201C;hairy footed.&#x201D; According to <italic>Meg</italic>. 9b, The Greek translators avoided the more common word for &#x201C;hare&#x201D; (i.e., <italic>Lagos</italic>) because it was the name of Ptolemy&#x2019;s wife. In actual fact, however, it was Ptolemy&#x2019;s father who was named <italic>Lagos</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn92">92. <italic>Tanh</italic>., Exod. 1:23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn93">93. According to Gen. 3:14, <small>THEN THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, YOU ARE MORE CURSED</small> <italic>arur</italic>. The midrash apparently identifies the curse with leprosy (<italic>tsar&#x2018;at</italic>). See Exod. R. 3:13, which specifically cites Gen. 3:14 and identifies the curse with leprosy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn94">94. Because Moses was not following the Holy One&#x2019;s instructions (in vs. 8) to <small>SPEAK UNTO THE ROCK</small> but (in vs. 11) <small>STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE WITH HIS ROD</small>, he was condemned (in vs. 12) not to enter the promised land.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn100">100. See below, 1:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101">101. This form, comparing this world and the world to come, is a common peroration to a parashah. It therefore seems likely that the triennial parashah ends here, even though the next section begins with Exod. 4:27, two verses before Exod. 4:29, which begins this section. See Jacob Mann, <italic>The Bible as Read and Preached in the Old Synagogue</italic>, Vol. I (Ktav, 1971), p. 372.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn102">102. The parallel accounts (<italic>Tanh</italic>., Exod. 1:25; Exod. R. 5:9) explain that the voice shifted successively to the north, the east, and the west, with Israel running after it in each case.</ftnote>

R. Hiyya bar Abba said: &#x003C;It would have been&#x003E; better for him if he had cleaned sewers, so that this verse would not be written about him. And what were the words?

Now you should mention, not only Solomon, but even Moses at the time that he went to Pharaoh. What is written (in Exod. 5:1)? <small>AFTERWARDS, MOSES AND AARON CAME &#x003C;AND SAID UNTO PHARAOH</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn137">16</xref></sup> R. Hiyya b. R.

Now Moses and Aaron were standing at the palace<sup><xref rid="fn141">20</xref></sup> gate. They came in to Pharaoh. They said to him: Two elders are standing at your palace gate. He said to them: Are there crowns in their hands? They told him: No. He said to them: Let them enter last. They came in to Pharaoh. He said to them: What do you want? They said to him (in Exod. 7:16, cf. 5:3): <small>THE LORD GOD OF THE HEBREWS SENT US UNTO YOU</small>; and he said to us, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY</small> &#x007B;<small>CELEBRATE A FESTIVAL TO ME</small>&#x007D; [<small>WORSHIP ME</small>] <small>IN THE DESERT</small>. He said to them (in Exod. 5:2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>, when he did not know &#x003C;enough&#x003E; to send me a crown of his. Rather he comes unto me with &#x003C;mere&#x003E; words. So (in Exod. 5:2) <small>WHO IS THE LORD THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>?</p>
<p>R. Joshua ben Levi said: At that time he brought out a document<sup><xref rid="fn142">21</xref></sup> of his god and read: The god of Edom, Moab, and Sidon. He said to them: See&#x0021; I have read, and one does not find what you are saying here. R. Levi said: To what is the matter comparable? To a priest who had a slave. &#x003C;When&#x003E; the priest left the country, his slave went looking for him among the graves. He began to cry: Lord&#x0021; Lord&#x0021; They said to him: Who is your lord? He said to them: Such-and-such a priest. They said to him: You are the world&#x2019;s greatest fool to seek a priest in the cemetery. So did Pharaoh say to Moses (in Exod. 5:2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD</small>? He brought out a document about &#x003C; false &#x003E; gods and sought him (the true God) within it. He said to him: &#x003C;You are&#x003E; the world&#x2019;s greatest fool&#x0021; The gods in your hand are dead, but our God is alive and everlasting. It is so stated (in Jer. 10:10): <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD: HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>.</p>
<title>2.3 Exodus 6:2ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 5:2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD</small>? The Holy One said to him: You have said: Who (<italic><small>MY</small></italic>)? By your life, through &#x003C;the letters&#x003E; <small><italic>MY</italic></small> you shall be punished (in Exod. 14:26&#x2013;15:21). <small><italic>MY</italic></small> (who) is <italic><small>YM</small></italic> (sea) in reverse order.

<p>(Exod. 5:3): <small>THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS</small>. Moses and Aaron said: &#x003C;These words were necessary&#x003E; because (in vs. 1) we had altered the wording (of Exod. 3:18) which was difficult for us. &#x003C;So&#x003E; they repeated &#x003C;themselves&#x003E; and said: <small>THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn146">25</xref></sup> R.

<p>(Exod. 5:9:) <small>LET HEAVIER WORK BE LAID UPON THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY WORK AT IT AND NOT PAY ATTENTION TO LYING WORDS</small>. &#x003C; What is the meaning of <small>NOT PAY ATTENTION</small> (rt.: <italic><small>Sh&#x2018;H</small></italic>)?&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn151">30</xref></sup> That they had scrolls with which they entertained themselves (rt.: <italic>Sh&#x2018;Sh</italic>&#x2018;) from Sabbath to Sabbath by saying: The Holy One is redeeming us.

Thus it is stated (in Exod. 5:6): <small>ON THAT SAME DAY PHARAOH COMMANDED THE TASKMASTERS OVER THE PEOPLE AND THEIR OFFICERS, SAYING</small>. He said to them (in vs. 7): <small>YOU SHALL NO LONGER GIVE THE PEOPLE STRAW</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: Tomorrow I am bringing plagues upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn152">31</xref></sup> They said: Pharaoh is sinning, and we are paying. When Israel goes out to bring stubble for them to make straw, the Egyptian smites them, when he sees them in the midst of his field. Therefore (in Exod. 5:12): <small>THEN THE PEOPLE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003C;TO GATHER STUBBLE FOR STRAW</small> &#x003E;. (Exod. 5:15) <small>THEN THE OFFICERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME AND</small> &#x007B;<small>SAID</small>&#x007D; [<small>CRIED</small>] <small>UNTO PHARAOH, &#x003C;SAYING: WHY HAVE YOU ACTED IN THIS WAY TOWARD YOUR SERVANTS</small>? &#x003E; What did he reply to them (in vs. 17)? <small>YOU ARE LAZY, LAZY</small>&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Exod. 5:20): <small>NOW THEY MET MOSES AND AARON STANDING IN THEIR PATH</small>. These &#x003C; officers &#x003E; were Dathan and Abiram, of whom it is written (in Numb. 16:27): <small>&#x003C;THEY&#x003E; CAME OUT STANDING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn153">32</xref></sup> (Exod. 5:21): <small>AND THEY SAID UNTO THEM: MAY THE LORD LOOK UPON YOU AND JUDGE</small>.

When the shepherd went after it, what did the wolf do? He sought to tear the lamb to pieces. Because of the shepherd (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>) the lamb came into danger.<sup><xref rid="fn155">34</xref></sup> Similarly Moses said to the Holy One: Between Pharaoh and you we are dying, as stated (in Exod. 5:21, cont.): <small>BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE OUR ODOR ABHORRENT &#x003C;IN THE EYES OF PHARAOH</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 5:22&#x2013;6:1): <small>THEN MOSES RETURNED UNTO THE LORD AND SAID: MY LORD, WHY DID YOU BRING HARM</small> (as if from <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn156">35</xref></sup> <small>UPON THIS PEOPLE</small>?&#x2026;. <small>FOR EVER SINCE I CAME UNTO PHARAOH &#x003C;TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME, HE HAS MISTREATED THIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: NOW YOU SHALL SEE &#x003C;WHAT I WILL DO TO PHARAOH&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C;You shall see only&#x003E; what I do to Pharaoh and the Egyptians, but what I do to the thirty-one kings you shall not see.<sup><xref rid="fn157">36</xref></sup> At that time the Holy One sought to sit in judgment over him.

GOD</small> (<italic>Elohim</italic>) must imply a judge.<sup><xref rid="fn158">37</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 22:27 [28]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT REVILE A GOD</small> (<italic>Elohim</italic>) <small>&#x003C;NOR A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE</small> &#x003E;. <sup><xref rid="fn159">38</xref></sup> A defense lawyer<sup><xref rid="fn160">39</xref></sup> came along and pleaded in his favor, as stated (in Exod. 6:2, cont.): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: I AM THE LORD</small>.

<title>2.5 Exodus 6:2ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 6:3): <small>AND I APPEARED UNTO ABRAHAM, UNTO ISAAC, AND UNTO JACOB AS EL SHADDAI, BUT BY MY NAME</small> Y--H <small>I WAS NOT KNOWN TO THEM</small>.

<title>2.6 Exodus 7:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 7:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. It is written (in Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>&#x2026;. Who said this verse? Solomon said it, when he made the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn165">44</xref></sup> He made an ark of ten cubits. Then he lifted it up to bring it into the Holy of Holies. When he reached the Sanctuary, the entrance was ten cubits. Now the ark (<italic>aron</italic>) was ten cubits, and ten cubits cannot get inside of ten &#x003C;cubits&#x003E;. Moreover, those who were bearing it &#x003C;needed space&#x003E;. When he saw that he was unable to bring it in, he felt ashamed and did not know what to do. He began to pray to the Holy One. What did Solomon do? He went and brought in the coffin (<italic>aron</italic>) of his father David. Then he prayed and said (in II Chron. 6:42): <small>MY LORD GOD, DO NOT TURN AWAY THE FACE OF YOUR ANOINTED; REMEMBER THE GOOD DEEDS OF YOUR SERVANT DAVID</small>. As soon as he mentioned the merit of his father David, he was answered immediately. What is written next (in II Chron. 7:1)? <small>WHEN SOLOMON FINISHED PRAYING, FIRE CAME DOWN</small> [<small>FROM HEAVEN&#x2026;, AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE HOUSE</small>.] Also the Holy Spirit cried out (in Eccl. 4:2): <small>THEN I PRAISED THE DEAD</small>. Solomon began saying (in Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>. At that time the gates were seeking to crush his skull, because they were of the opinion that perhaps he was speaking on his own authority. (Ibid., cont.): <small>SO THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN</small>. They said to him (in Ps. 24:8 &#x0026; 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? He said to them (in vs. 10, cont.): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY. SELAH</small>. When he had said that to them, they left him alone.</p>
<title>2.7 Exodus 7:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 24:8 &#x0026; 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? Who is he? This is the king who distributes glory to those who fear him (according to vs. 10, cont.): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, &#x003C;HE IS THE KING OF GLORY&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn166">45</xref></sup> In what way? In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one sits on his throne;<sup><xref rid="fn167">46</xref></sup> yet the Holy One had Solomon sit on his throne. It is so stated (in I Chron. 29:23): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD</small>. In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one rides upon his horse; yet the Holy One had Elijah ride on his horse. Now what is the horse of the Holy One? Whirlwind and storm, as stated (in Nahum 1:3): <small>THE LORD IS IN THE WHIRLWIND, AND THE STORM IS HIS ROAD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn168">47</xref></sup> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one uses his scepter; yet Moses used the scepter of the Holy One. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:20): <small>AND MOSES TOOK THE ROD OF GOD IN HIS HAND</small>. In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one puts on his crown; yet the Holy One has given crowns to the Messianic King. It is so stated (in Ps. 21:4): <small>YOU HAVE SET ON HIS HEAD A CROWN OF FINE GOLD</small>. In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one puts on his robes; yet Israel has put on the Holy One&#x2019;s robes, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; strength. It is so stated (in Is. 51:9): <small>AWAKE, AWAKE, PUT ON STRENGTH, O ARM OF THE LORD</small>; and he has given it to Israel, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one calls &#x003C;anyone else&#x003E; by his title, as &#x003C;for example&#x003E; Caesar, Augustus, &#x003C;or&#x003E; King;<sup><xref rid="fn169">48</xref></sup> and, if a certain person calls anyone by one of them, he will not live. Do you yourself know a person who calls his friend Augusta so-and-so? But the Holy One said to Moses: See, I have made you like me to Pharaoh. I am called God; and in that name I created the world, as stated (in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>. And here I have made you like me, a god to Pharaoh. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 7:1) <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 24:8 &#x0026; 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? The one who distributes glory to those who fear him.</p>
<title>2.8 Exodus 7:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:1) <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. The Holy One said: Because he made himself into a god, they informed him that he was nothing in the world. See, I have made you a god over him.<sup><xref rid="fn170">49</xref></sup> And where is it shown that Pharaoh made himself into a god? Where it is stated (of Pharaoh in Ezek. 29:3): &#x007B;<small>BECAUSE HE</small>&#x007D; [<small>WHO</small>] <small>SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; [<small>MY</small>] <small>NILE IS MY OWN, AND I MADE MYSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn171">50</xref></sup> I am the one who created myself. Now this is one of four sons of Adam who made themselves into gods and had sexual relations like women.<sup><xref rid="fn172">51</xref></sup> Three were from the nations of the world, and one was from Israel. They were the following: Hiram, Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, and Joash. Where is it shown of Hiram? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 28:2): <small>SAY TO THE PRINCE OF TYRE: THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD: BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS PROUD, YOU HAVE SAID: I AM A GOD</small>. Because he had made himself into a god, he had sexual relations like women, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>YOU HAVE DEBASED YOUR WISDOM&#x2026;; &#x003C;I HAVE CAST YOU UPON THE GROUND; I HAVE GIVEN YOU OVER BEFORE KINGS &#x003E; TO STARE AT YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO STARE</small> (<italic><small>R&#x2019;WH</small></italic>) <small>AT YOU</small>? &#x003C;That&#x003E; they would work their &#x201C;friendship&#x201D; (as if from <italic><small>R&#x2019;WT</small></italic>) on you. Where is it shown of Nebuchadnezzar? Where it is stated &#x003C;of the king of Babylon that he said&#x003E; (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life, (in vs. 15) <small>YOU SHALL ALSO BE BROUGHT DOWN UNTO SHEOL, UNTO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE PIT</small>. What did the Holy one do? He banished him while he was in his kingship and had him eat grass like the cattle. It is so stated (in Dan. 4:22 [25]): <small>AND THEY SHALL FEED YOU GRASS LIKE OXEN</small>&#x2026;. So, when the cattle and the wild beasts saw him in the likeness of a &#x003C;female&#x003E; animal, they had sexual relations with him, as stated (in Hab. 2:17): <small>AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE BEASTS WILL TERRIFY THOSE FEMALES</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TERRIFY THOSE FEMALES</small> (rt.: <small><italic>HTT</italic>&#x002B;<italic>N</italic></small>)? &#x003C;Its meaning &#x003E; is like what is stated (in Deut. 7:3): <small>YOU SHALL NOT INTERMARRY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HTN</small></italic>) <small>WITH THEM</small>. So he became a bridegroom (<italic><small>HTN</small></italic>) to all cattle and wild beasts. Where is it shown of Joash? Where it is stated (in II Chron. 24:17): <small>NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BOWED LOW TO THE KING</small>? That they made him &#x003C; their &#x003E; god. Moreover, since he was in agreement, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEN THE KING HEARKENED TO THEM</small>, he had sexual relations like a woman. Thus it is stated (vs. 24): <small>&#x003C;FOR THE ARMY OF ARAM CAME WITH A FEW MEN</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E; <small>SO THEY INFLICTED JUDGMENTS ON JOASH</small>. It is just as it says (in Lev. 20:13): <small>IF A MAN LIES WITH A MALE AS ONE LIES WITH A WOMAN, BOTH OF THEM HAVE COMMITTED AN ABOMINATION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn173">52</xref></sup> Pharaoh also made himself into a god and had sexual relations like a woman. It is so stated (in Jer. 44:30): <small>BEHOLD, I AM GIVING PHARAOH HOPHRA, KING OF EGYPT, &#x003C;INTO THE HANDS OF HIS ENEMIES&#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HOPHRA</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PR</small></italic>&#x2018;)?<sup><xref rid="fn174">53</xref></sup> That they uncovered (<italic><small>PR</small></italic>&#x2018;) his posterior. He was a pharaoh who had been a male and became a female. Another interpretation of <small>HOPHRA</small>. &#x003C;Its meaning is&#x003E; like that used (in the context of Numb. 5:18): <small>AND HE</small> (the priest) <small>SHALL UNCOVER</small> (<italic><small>PR</small>&#x2018;</italic>) <small>THE WOMAN&#x2019;S HEAD</small>. And to which father&#x2019;s house did he belong? (Is. 19:16:) <small>IN THAT DAY</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LAND OF EGYPT SHALL BE A FESTIVAL</small>&#x2026;.&#x007D; [<small>EGYPT SHALL BE LIKE WOMEN</small>.] And what was the cause? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because he made himself into a god. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 29:3): &#x007B;<small>BECAUSE HE</small>&#x007D; [<small>WHO</small>] <small>SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; [<small>MY</small>] <small>NILE IS MY OWN, AND I MADE MYSELF</small>. For that reason the Holy One said to Moses: Because he has made himself into a god, go and become a god over him. It is so stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. Why? (Eccl. 5:7 [8]:) <small>FOR ONE EXALTED PERSON WATCHES ANOTHER FROM ABOVE, AND THERE ARE MORE EXALTED ONES OVER THEM</small>. Ergo, you are a god over him; so make him an arrogant abomination (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>) in the world because he became exalted by himself. And this is what is written (in Job 41:26 [34]): <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>, &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>). Does the Holy One not see the lowly? It is also written (in Zech. 4:10): <small>&#x003C;THESE SEVEN ARE&#x003E; THE EYES OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. And (in Job 41:26 [34]) what is the meaning of <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>? R. Berekhyah said: These are the proud, whose spirit becomes &#x003C;too&#x003E; haughty for them, so that they exalt themselves and make themselves into gods. What does the Holy One do to them? He exhibits them to mortals and makes them arrogant abominations (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>) in the world, as stated (in Job 41:26 [34]): <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>). &#x003C;There is&#x003E; Nebuchadnezzar, for example, in that he made him an arrogant abomination (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>), as stated (in Dan. 5:21): <small>HE WAS DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANS</small>&#x2026;. So also was Sennacherib made an arrogant abomination (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>), as stated (II Kings 19:35 &#x003D; Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THAT NIGHT THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C;ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND &#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>&#x2026;. Thus the Holy One shows the abominable arrogance (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>) of the proud to every creature. The Holy One has said (in Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2018;H</small></italic>) <small>HIM</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD</small>. R. Benjamin bar Levi said: If someone goes to handle the Torah and sits by himself, I will exhibit (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2018;H</small></italic>) his deed in the world. And so, if someone conceals himself to commit a transgression, I will exhibit (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2018;H</small></italic>)his deed to the world. It is so stated (in Jer. 23:24): <small>SHALL I NOT SEE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2018;H</small></italic>) <small>HIM</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD. DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? SAYS THE LORD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>I FILL</small>? R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: The Holy One said: From him (i.e., from his evil works) I will fill the upper and lower worlds. Then I will exhibit (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>) him to humankind as an arrogant abomination (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>). Why? Because they (sic) are proud and make themselves into gods. (Job 41:26 [34]:) <small>HE BEHOLDS EVERYTHING EXALTED</small>, &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>HE IS KING OVER ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABOMINABLE ARROGANCE</small> (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>). Thus he reigns over all those who are proud and makes them arrogant abominations (<italic><small>ShHTs</small></italic>). For that reason, the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. Go and exact punishment from him.<sup><xref rid="fn175">54</xref></sup> Go and bring the ten plagues (of Exod. 7:14&#x2013;12:29) upon him. He said to him: How shall I bring the plagues upon him? The Holy One said to him (in Exod. 4:17): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE IN YOUR HAND THIS ROD, &#x003C; WITH WHICH YOU SHALL PERFORM THE SIGNS&#x003E;</small>. R. Judah bar Ammi said: The rod which he had weighed forty seahs<sup><xref rid="fn176">55</xref></sup> and was &#x003C;made&#x003E; of sapphire.<sup><xref rid="fn177">56</xref></sup> Moreover ten plagues were inscribed upon it through an acronym,<sup><xref rid="fn178">57</xref></sup> &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; <italic>DeTsaKh &#x2018;aDaSh Be&#x2019;aHaBh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn179">58</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: this rod will bring the plagues upon him. (Exod. 7:1:) <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>.</p>
<title>2.9 Exodus 7:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO PHARAOH</small>? &#x003C;Just&#x003E; because I called you a god, your spirit should not become &#x003C;too&#x003E; haughty for you. You are a god only to Pharaoh. So it also says (in Exod. 6:2): <small>SO GOD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND SAID UNTO HIM: I AM THE LORD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>I AM THE LORD</small>? Actually he said to him: Although I made you a god, I am the Lord. You are a god only to Pharaoh. It says so (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn180">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly you say (in Ps. 50:7): <small>HEARKEN, O MY PEOPLE, AND LET ME SPEAK, O ISRAEL, SO THAT I MAY ADMONISH YOU: I AM GOD, YOUR GOD</small>. When Israel stood at Mount Sinai (according to Exod. 24:7): <small>THEY SAID: ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small>. R. Johanan said: Sixty myriads of angels came down and put crowns on their heads.<sup><xref rid="fn181">60</xref></sup> R. Simay said: He clothed them in purple.<sup><xref rid="fn182">61</xref></sup> Rav Huna of Sepphoris said: He girded them with girdles.<sup><xref rid="fn183">62</xref></sup> R. Simeon said: They gave them weapons. The great name was inscribed on them; and, as long as it was in their hands, the angel of death was unable to prevail over them.<sup><xref rid="fn184">63</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:16): <small>INSCRIBED ON THE TABLETS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>INSCRIBED</small> (<italic><small>HRWT</small></italic>)? R. Judah says: Freedom (<italic><small>HRWT</small></italic>) from the empires.<sup><xref rid="fn185">64</xref></sup> R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said in the name of R. Johanan, &#x003C;who spoke &#x003E; in the name of R. Eleazar the Son of R. Jose [the Galilean]: &#x003C;The Holy One said:&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn186">65</xref></sup> If the angel of death should come and say to me: Why was I created, I should say to him: Surely I created you to be over the nations of the world and not over my children. Why? Because I made them gods, as stated (in Ps. 82:6): <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS; EVEN ALL OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH</small>. Therefore, when he came to give them the commandments, he said to them: Heed what I am saying to you. For this reason it is stated (in Ps. 50:7) <small>HEARKEN, O MY PEOPLE, AND LET ME SPEAK, O ISRAEL, SO THAT I MAY ADMONISH YOU: I AM GOD, YOUR GOD</small>. See, the Holy One said to Moses here: Although I made you a god, I am &#x003C;still&#x003E; your God. You are a god only to Pharaoh. It is so stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>.</p>
<title>2.10 Exodus 7:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation: Just as the interpreter comes to interpret, and the speaker (<italic>amora</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn187">66</xref></sup> speaks out (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>) in his presence; so (in Exod. 7:2): <small>YOU SHALL SPEAK</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO EVERYONE WHOM</small>&#x007D; [<small>EVERYTHING WHICH</small>] <small>I COMMAND YOU, AND YOUR BROTHER AARON SHALL SPEAK UNTO PHARAOH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn188">67</xref></sup> (Exod. 6:27:) <small>THEY WERE THE ONES WHO SPOKE UNTO PHARAOH</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: In this world I have exacted retribution from Egypt through ten plagues, but in the world to come, I am exacting punishment from Gog. It is so stated (concerning Gog in Ezek. 38:22): <small>I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM WITH PESTILENCE AND WITH BLOOD; AND I WILL POUR TORRENTIAL RAIN, HAILSTONES, FIRE, AND BRIMSTONE &#x003C;UPON HIM AND HIS HOSTS AND THE MANY PEOPLES THAT ARE WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn189">68</xref></sup></p>
<title>2.11 Exodus 7:8ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 7:8&#x2013;9:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU, &#x003C; SAYING &#x003E; PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE, &#x003C;YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH. IT SHALL BECOME A SERPENT&#x003E;</small>. This text is related to (Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING, AND FROM OF OLD, THINGS THAT HAVE NOT &#x003C;YET&#x003E; HAPPENED, SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small> (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn190">69</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>? The Holy One declares from the start what is going to happen in the end. Where is it shown? Where he said so to Moses (in Deut. 31:16): <small>BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING &#x003C;AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. He told him what Israel was going to do after Joshua had been dead for some years. (Ibid.:) <small>AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND</small>. And so they did (according to Jud. 2:11): <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD AND THEY WORSHIPPED THE BAALS</small>&#x2026;. (Deut. 31:16, cont.:) <small>THEY WILL FORSAKE ME AND BREAK MY COVENANT</small>. (Cf. Jud. 2:12:) <small>THEY FORSOOK THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>AND DID NOT WORSHIP HIM</small>&#x007D;. Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Whoever hears this verse is thinking: Is there a love of strife<sup><xref rid="fn191">70</xref></sup> above? (Cf. Is. 46:10, cont.:) <small>SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>. Why so? Because the Holy One does not desire (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>) to convict any creature, as stated (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS</small> (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>) <small>IN WICKEDNESS</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn192">71</xref></sup> And so it says (in Ezek. 33:11): <small>I DO NOT DESIRE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>) <small>THE DEATH OF THE WICKED &#x003C;BUT THAT THE WICKED TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE</small>.&#x003E;&#x2026; Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>SAYING: MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small> (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>). Thus the Holy One desires (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>) to declare all his creatures righteous, as stated (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED</small> (<italic><small>HPTs</small></italic>) <small>BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn193">72</xref></sup> Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. The Holy One made known to Moses, while he was at the bush, what Pharaoh was going to do. He said to him (in Exod. 4:2&#x2013;4): <small>MOSES, WHAT IS THIS IN YOUR HAND? AND HE SAID: A ROD. THEN HE SAID: CAST IT TO THE GROUND, SO HE CAST IT TO THE GROUND AND IT BECAME A SNAKE&#x2026;. THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: PUT OUT YOUR HAND AND GRASP IT BY THE TAIL</small>&#x2026;. So it reverted and became a rod. The Holy One said to him: Moses, just as the snake bends itself, so Pharaoh is going to bend himself because of you. Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. When he comes and says (in Exod. 7:9): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>, simply do for him just as I have done.</p>
<title>2.12 Exodus 7:8ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:9): <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU, &#x003C;SAYING PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE, YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH. IT SHALL BECOME A SERPENT</small>. &#x003E; This text is related (to Prov. 29:11): <small>A FOOL VENTS HIS WHOLE SPIRIT; BUT A WISE PERSON STILLS HIM IN THE END</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn194">73</xref></sup> Whenever someone who is a fool or stupid comes to quarrel with his companion, he vents everything he has; but when that one is wise, in the end he causes him to cease.<sup><xref rid="fn195">74</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Prov. 29:11): <small>A FOOL VENTS HIS WHOLE SPIRIT</small>. Who is this? This is Pharaoh. When Moses and Aaron went to him, the Holy One said to them: Before you go to him, I am telling you what he is going to do &#x003C;to you&#x003E; and ask you. (Exod. 7:9:) <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU</small>, simply be careful. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD &#x003C;AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH&#x003E;</small>. When they went to Pharaoh, he said (ibid., cont): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>. Immediately (in vs. 10): <small>AARON CAST DOWN HIS ROD</small>. Then Pharaoh laughed at them. He said to them: Moses and Aaron, what are you thinking? That you have come to mock me? But I am not afraid of these things. All Egypt is full of magicians. There are people who carry straw to Afarayim, fine gold to Rekem (i.e., coals to Newcastle).<sup><xref rid="fn196">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Then Pharaoh called&#x201D; is not written here (next in vs. 11), but <small>THEN PHARAOH <italic>ALSO</italic> CALLED</small>. R. Levi said that he called to his wife and said to her: See how the Jews have come to mock me&#x0021; Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 3:6): <small>THEN SHE <italic>ALSO</italic> GAVE SOME TO HER HUSBAND</small>. Here too &#x003C;it says&#x003E;: <small>THEN PHARAOH <italic>ALSO</italic> CALLED</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 7:11, cont.:) <small>AND THE EGYPTIAN MAGICIANS ALSO DID &#x003C;SO WITH THEIR RODS&#x003E;</small>. The Egyptian magicians came <small>AND</small> (in vs. 12) <small>EACH CAST DOWN HIS ROD</small>, just as Aaron had done; (ibid., cont.) <small>AND THEY BECAME SERPENTS</small>. What is written (in vs. 12, cont.)? <small>BUT AARON&#x2019;S ROD SWALLOWED THEIR RODS</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 29:11): <small>A FOOL VENTS HIS WHOLE SPIRIT</small>. This is Pharaoh. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A WISE PERSON STILLS HIM IN THE END</small>. This refers to Moses and Aaron of whom it is written (in Exod. 7:12): <small>BUT AARON&#x2019;S ROD SWALLOWED THEIR RODS</small>.</p>
<title>2.13 Exodus 7:8ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 7:9): <small>WHEN PHARAOH SPEAKS UNTO YOU</small>, &#x2026; The Holy One said: Tomorrow I am leading my children out of Egypt and giving them the Torah. Now in it there is written (in Deut. 13:2 [1]): <small>IF THERE ARISES AMONG YOU A PROPHET &#x003C;OR ONE WHO DIVINES BY A DREAM AND HE GIVES YOU A SIGN OR A PORTENT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. It is only right for him to summon you and say to you (in Exod. 7:8): <small>PRODUCE YOUR MIRACLE</small>&#x2026;. At first he will speak to you harshly, since the word <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DBR</small></italic> in Exod. 7:9) is nothing but a word implying harshness. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; just as you say (in Gen. 42:30): <small>THE MAN, THE LORD OF THE LAND, SPOKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DBR</small></italic>) <small>WITH US HARSHLY</small>. He said to him: Aaron will do these things, but you shall stand like a prince giving decrees to the elders while they carry them out. (According to Exod. 7:9, cont.,) <small>YOU SHALL SAY UNTO AARON: TAKE YOUR ROD AND CAST IT DOWN BEFORE PHARAOH</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 7:10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON CAME</small>&#x2026; It was proper for Aaron to enter first because he was three years older than &#x003C; Moses &#x003E;, but in the eyes of the Egyptians Moses was greater, as stated (in Exod. 11:3): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>ALSO THE MAN MOSES WAS VERY GREAT IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 7:10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON CAME UNTO PHARAOH AND DID JUST AS THE LORD HAD COMMANDED: AARON CAST DOWN HIS ROD</small>. &#x003C;This was the&#x003E; beginning. Then after that they brought on this plague and after that, a second plague. They performed all the deeds before him. Nevertheless, he paid no attention.</p>
<title>2.14 Exodus 7:8ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 7:14:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: PHARAOH&#x2019;S HEART IS HARDENED</small>. The Holy One said: By your life, through that word (<small>HARDENED</small>), because you have hardened (rt.: <italic><small>KBD</small></italic>) your heart, I will be honored (rt.: <italic><small>KBD</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn197">76</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Exod. 14:18): <small>WHEN I HAVE BEEN HONORED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>KBD</small></italic>) <small>THROUGH PHARAOH</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 7:14, cont.:) <small>HE REFUSES TO LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small> (<italic>shillah</italic>). The Holy One said: You are refusing to let them go. By your life, you yourself will take each and every one of them by the hand and send them away (<italic>shillah</italic>). The Holy One said to Moses: Go and bring the plague of blood upon them. Then you shall say unto them (in Exod. 7:17): <small>BY THIS YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. Why did he bring upon them the plague of blood first?<sup><xref rid="fn198">77</xref></sup> Because Pharaoh and the Egyptians were worshiping the Nile.

A common<sup><xref rid="fn199">78</xref></sup> (Aramaic) proverb says: Blot out the god and the idol-priests are confounded &#x007B;i.e., smite the idol and the idol-priests are confounded&#x007D;.

See what is written (in vs. 19): <small>&#x003C;TAKE YOUR ROD AND STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND OVER THE WATERS OF EGYPT: &#x003E; OVER ITS RIVERS, &#x003C;OVER ITS CANALS, OVER ITS PONDS, AND OVER EVERY BODY OF ITS WATER SO THAT THEY BECOME BLOOD&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn200">79</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>OVER ITS RIVERS</small>?

Even what was in the cup<sup><xref rid="fn201">80</xref></sup> became blood, and even what an Egyptian was spitting out of his mouth became blood.<sup><xref rid="fn202">81</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in ibid., cont.): <small>AND THERE SHALL BE BLOOD IN THE WHOLE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. R. Abbin the Levite said: Israel became rich from the plague of blood.<sup><xref rid="fn203">82</xref></sup> How? When an Egyptian and an Israelite were in the same house, the tank was full of water; but when the Egyptian went to fill a cup from it, it became blood. So when the Israelite went and drank water from it, the Egyptian would say: Give me a little of the water in your hand; but when he gave it to him, it turned out to be blood in the Egyptian&#x2019;s hand. Then he would say to him: Come, you and I, and let us drink from the &#x003C;same&#x003E; bowl. But the Israelite was &#x003C; still &#x003E; drinking water; and the Egyptian, blood. When, however, an Egyptian took water from an Israelite for a price, he would drink water. For that reason Israel became rich from the plague of blood. And how long did the plague stay with them? R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differed.<sup><xref rid="fn204">83</xref></sup> The one said: &#x003C;The Holy One&#x003E; warned them for twenty-four days, while the &#x003C; actual &#x003E; plague functioned against them for seven days. But the other said: He warned them for seven days, while the &#x003C; actual &#x003E; plague functioned against them for twenty-four days.</p>
<title>2.15 Exodus 7:8ff., Part V</title>
<p>R. Eleazar ben Pedat says: Just as the Holy One brought &#x003C;the plague&#x003E; upon the Egyptians, he is going to bring &#x003C;it&#x003E; upon this nation (i.e., Rome).<sup><xref rid="fn205">84</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Is. 23:5): <small>AS AT THE REPORT CONCERNING EGYPT, THEY SHALL TREMBLE AT THE REPORT OF TYRE</small>. R. Eleazar said: Every <small>TYRE</small> which is spelled &#x007B;with&#x007D; [without] the vowel letter is speaking about this evil nation (i.e., Rome). Just as Egypt was afflicted with blood, &#x003C;so&#x003E; also shall it be with this evil nation. (Thus according to Is. 34:9) <small>ITS</small><sup><xref rid="fn206">85</xref></sup> <small>STREAMS SHALL BE TURNED TO PITCH</small>&#x2026;. R. Tanhuma said: These are the Tiber<sup><xref rid="fn207">86</xref></sup> and the Ticino,<sup><xref rid="fn208">87</xref></sup> which are situated on the edge of Rome.<sup><xref rid="fn209">88</xref></sup> It is also written (in Is. 34:10): <small>NIGHT AND DAY IT SHALL NOT BE QUENCHED</small>. And why? Because they kept Israel from the Torah, in which they labored day and night, the fire which I bring upon them shall never be quenched. Rather (according to ibid., cont.:) <small>ITS SMOKE SHALL RISE UP FOREVER</small>, because they burned my house and the smoke rose up from it. They also say (in Is. 66:6): <small>A SOUND OF TUMULT FROM THE CITY</small>. The Holy One said to them (ibid., cont.): <small>A NOISE FROM THE TEMPLE</small>. Then he says: Remember what you did to the temple; (i.e., in ibid., cont.) <small>THE THUNDER OF THE LORD IS REPAYING RETRIBUTION TO HIS ENEMIES</small>, in the world to come, when he redeems Israel. Thus it is stated (in Is. 35:4): <small>WITH THE RECOMPENSE OF THE LORD GOD HE WILL COME AND SAVE YOU</small>.</p>
<title>2.16 Exodus 9:13ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 9:13&#x2013;14:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: GO EARLY IN THE MORNING TO PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE PHARAOH; &#x003C;AND SAY UNTO HIM: THUS SAYS THE LORD,&#x003E;&#x2026; &#x003C; LET MY PEOPLE GO TO WORSHIP ME.&#x003E; FOR THIS TIME &#x003C;I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES UPON YOUR HEART&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn210">89</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 9:21 [20]): <small>PUT</small> <italic><small>MORAH</small></italic> <small>INTO THEM, O LORD; &#x003C;LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN. SELAH&#x003E;</small>. Turn their faces red. What is the meaning of <italic><small>MORAH</small></italic>? He caused the spirit of folly to enter them.<sup><xref rid="fn211">90</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Ps. 9:21 [20]): <small>PUT</small> <italic><small>MORAH</small></italic> <small>INTO THEM, O LORD</small>. Because they are acquiring lordship (<italic>mariyyut</italic>) for themselves, make known to them that you are Lord (<italic>Adon</italic>) over all of them. <small>PUT</small> <italic><small>MORAH</small></italic> <small>INTO THEM, O LORD; LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn212">91</xref></sup> Now they were making themselves into deities. Hiram king of Tyre made himself into a deity, as stated (in Ezek. 28:2): <small>BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS PROUD, YOU HAVE SAID: I AM A GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn213">92</xref></sup> The Holy One informed him that he was mortal, as stated (in Ezek. 28:17): <small>I HAVE CAST YOU UNTO THE GROUND; I HAVE SET YOU BEFORE KINGS FOR THEM TO STARE AT YOU</small>. The Holy One informed him that he was flesh and blood. Ergo (in Ps. 9:21 [20]): <small>LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN. SELAH</small>.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar made himself into a deity, as stated (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; &#x003C;I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small> &#x003E;. The Holy One informed him that he was flesh and blood, as stated (in Dan. 4:29 [32]): <small>YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANKIND</small>.</p>
<p>Joash also made himself into a deity, as stated (in II Chron. 24:17): [<small>NOW</small>] <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA</small> &#x007B;<small>THE PRIEST</small>&#x007D;, <small>&#x003C;THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING</small>.&#x003E;. They said to him: You are a deity. Were you not a deity, you would not have spent six years in the Holy of Holies (II Chron. 22:12). The High Priest would only enter there one time (each year), and everyone would pray for him to enter in peace. Now you have remained there six years. Were you not a deity, you would not have lived. At that time he accepted &#x003C; this ascription&#x003E; from them, as stated (in II Chron. 24:17, cont.): <small>THEN THE KING HEARKENED UNTO THEM</small>. Immediately the Holy One informed him that he was flesh and blood. What is written (in vs. 24)? <small>SO THEY INFLICTED JUDGMENTS ON JOASH</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 9:21 [20]): <small>LET THE NATIONS KNOW THAT THEY ARE ONLY HUMAN. SELAH</small>.</p>
<p>Pharaoh made himself into a deity, as stated (in Ezek. 29:9): <small>BECAUSE HE SAID</small>: &#x007B;<small>MY</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE</small>] <small>NILE IS MINE AND I MADE</small> &#x007B;<small>MYSELF</small>&#x007D; [<small>IT</small>]. He said: I am the one who created myself. Immediately &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; made known to him that he was flesh and blood. The Holy One said &#x003C;to Moses &#x003E;: Because he has made himself into a deity, inform him that he is flesh and blood. See, he is setting out on the way to his morning toilet. Grab him and inform him that he is flesh and blood. What did Moses do? Immediately, as soon as the Holy One told him to go to Pharaoh early in the morning, Moses grabbed him. He said: Leave me alone to make my toilet, and after that I shall speak with you. Moses said to him: Is there a deity who makes his toilet? Therefore, the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 9:13): <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>, and inform him that he is flesh and blood.</p>
<title>2.17 Exodus 9:13ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 9:13:) <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 22:29): <small>DO YOU SEE SOMEONE DILIGENT AT HIS WORK</small>?&#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn214">93</xref></sup> Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah disagree. R. Judah says: It is speaking about Joseph. When he was sold into Egypt, he was diligent in his work (according to Gen. 39:11): <small>AND HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE</small> (of Potiphar) <small>TO DO HIS WORK</small>. (Prov. 22:29, cont.:) <small>HE SHALL STAND BEFORE KINGS</small>. This is Joseph. What is written about him (in Gen. 41:46)? Now Joseph was thirty years old [when he stood before Pharaoh, the king of Egypt]. (Prov. 22:29, cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT STAND BEFORE THE OBSCURE</small>. This refers to Potiphar&#x2019;s wife.<sup><xref rid="fn215">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 22:29): <small>DO YOU SEE SOMEONE DILIGENT AT HIS WORK</small>? It speaks about Moses. What is written (in Exod. 2:11)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THOSE</small> &#x007B;<small>MANY</small>&#x007D; <small>DAYS, WHEN MOSES HAD GROWN UP, &#x003C;THAT HE WENT OUT TO HIS KINSFOLK AND LOOKED UPON THEIR BURDENS</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. R. Judah says: Do not all children grow up, just as it says (here of Moses): <small>WHEN &#x003C;MOSES&#x003E; HAD GROWN UP</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn216">95</xref></sup> It is simply that, when he was five years old, he was found to be like a child of eleven.<sup><xref rid="fn217">96</xref></sup> What in written (above in Exod. 2:10)? [<small>WHEN THE BOY HAD GROWN UP</small>.] (Likewise in vs. 11:) <small>WHEN MOSES HAD GROWN UP</small>. &#x003C;That he <small>HAD GROWN UP</small> is stated&#x003E; two times. Above (in vs. 10) in reference to stature; below (in vs. 11) in reference to greatness. What was his greatness (in vs. 11)? <small>THAT HE WENT OUT UNTO HIS KINSFOLK</small>?</p>
<p>(Exod. 2:13:) <small>WHEN HE WENT OUT ON THE SECOND DAY, HERE THERE WERE TWO HEBREW MEN FIGHTING</small> (<italic><small>NTsYM</small></italic>). R. Abbahu said that they were emitting sparks (<italic><small>NYTsWTsYN</small></italic>) from their heels.<sup><xref rid="fn218">97</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE: WHY ARE YOU STRIKING YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>? R. Isaac said: You learn from here that whoever raises his hand against his comrade is called wicked, since it is stated (ibid.): <small>SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn219">98</xref></sup> He said to him (in Exod. 2:14): <small>WHO APPOINTED YOU &#x003C;A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US&#x003E;</small>? R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, why is this people enslaved? There are seventy nations in the world and none of them are enslaved except this nation alone. Surely this sin is known, even as written (in Exod. 2:14, cont.): <small>SURELY THE MATTER IS KNOWN</small>, since you were not were enslaved for nothing. What did Moses do (in Exod. 2:15)? <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM BEFORE PHARAOH</small> and went into Midian &#x003C;to be&#x003E; with Jethro. (Prov. 22:29:) <small>SOMEONE DILIGENT AT HIS WORK</small>. This is Moses. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE SHALL STAND BEFORE KINGS</small>. This refers to Pharaoh. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT STAND BEFORE THE OBSCURE</small>. This refers to Jethro. Thus the Holy One said to him (i.e., Moses, in Exod. 4:19): <small>&#x003C;THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES IN MIDIAN: &#x003E; GO BACK TO EGYPT</small>. Then he said to him (in Exod. 9:13): <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING &#x003C;TO PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE PHARAOH&#x003E;</small>. R. Nehemiah said: See, you have made the holy profane and the profane holy. (Prov. 22:29:) <small>HE SHALL STAND BEFORE KINGS</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; before the Holy One; (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT STAND BEFORE THE OBSCURE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HShK</small></italic>). This refers to Pharaoh, as stated (in Ezek. 30:18): <small>IN TEHAPHNEHES</small><sup><xref rid="fn220">99</xref></sup> <small>THE DAY SHALL BE DARKENED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HShK</small></italic>) &#x003C; <small>WHEN I BREAK THERE THE YOKES OF EGYPT&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>2.18 Exodus 9:13ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 22:29:) <small>HE SHALL STAND BEFORE KINGS</small>. This refers to the Holy One, of whom it is written (in Deut. 5:28 [31]): <small>BUT AS FOR YOU, STAND HERE WITH ME</small>. (Prov. 22:29, cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT STAND BEFORE THE OBSCURE</small>. This is Pharaoh, [since it is written &#x003C;of Moses&#x003E;] (in Exod. 9:13): <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING &#x003C;TO PRESENT YOURSELF BEFORE PHARAOH&#x003E;</small>. All the wicked ones become corrupt during their lifetimes. You find in the case of Zedekiah, king of Judah, that all the kings were subjugated to Nebuchadnezzar. What is written about him (in Jer. 27:6)? &#x007B;<small>ALL</small>&#x007D; [<small>AND EVEN</small>] <small>THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD HAVE I GIVEN HIM TO SERVE HIM</small>. Zedekiah went up to offer a gift.<sup><xref rid="fn221">100</xref></sup> Nebuchadnezzar said: Dine with me at noon. So he made a dinner. Now a Babylonian dinner is not like a dinner in the land of Israel. He brought him meat which he had roasted. He saw Nebuchadnezzar eating with his spittle running down onto his beard. Zedekiah looked at him in astonishment and said: Is it to this one that the whole world is subjugated? He ate with him. What did he do? After he had dined, he took Zedekiah and made him take an oath. He said to him: &#x003C;Swear&#x003E; that you shall not go to your land and leave me. He got free and came to the land of Israel. He began to scorn (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) him, and he revoked that oath &#x003C;which he had taken &#x003E;. So Ezekiel cried out concerning him (in Ezek. 17:16): &#x007B;<small>BECAUSE HE SCORNED</small> (<italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) <small>AN OATH</small>&#x007D; [<small>WHOSE OATH HE SCORNED</small> (<italic><small>BZH</small></italic>)]. The kings who were reclining with him heard him. They sent and said to him (to Nebuchadnezzar): Zedekiah is sitting &#x003C;here&#x003E; laughing at you. Where is it shown that they sent to him and said &#x003C; this &#x003E; to him? R. Samuel said: It is written (in Is. 16:1): <small>SEND A LAMB</small> (<italic><small>KR</small></italic>) <small>TO THE RULER OF THE LAND</small>. What is the meaning of <italic><small>KR</small></italic>? It is like someone who says to his comrade: Find out (<italic><small>HKR</small></italic>) for whom he is ruling the land. Where is it shown that he had sworn an oath to him? Where it is stated (in II Chron. 36:13): <small>AND HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO HAD MADE HIM TAKE AN OATH BY GOD</small>. What did he do? He immediately sent and had him come. Then he fed him barley, stood him up, and scorned (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) him shamefully. The Holy One said (to Nebuchadnezzar): So you have shamed (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) him. By your life, you shall not depart from this world until all creatures laugh at you. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 4:29 [32]): <small>YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANKIND</small>. Moreover, just as you have shamed (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) him, so you shall be shamed (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) before all creatures. What is written (in Hab. 2:17)? <small>AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE BEASTS WILL TERRIFY THOSE FEMALES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HTT</small></italic>&#x002B;<italic><small>N</small></italic>)&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn222">101</xref></sup> R. Abba bar Kahana said that he became a bridegroom (<italic><small>HTN</small></italic>) to all cattle and wild beasts. And what caused him this shame (rt.: <italic><small>BZH</small></italic>)? It was simply because he had shamed (<italic><small>BZH</small></italic>) Zedekiah.</p>
<p>And also in the case of Pharaoh, he was gnashing his teeth against Moses. Now he had said to them (the Israelites, in Exod. 5:17): <small>YOU ARE LAZY, LAZY</small>&#x0021; R. Judah b. R. Simon said: What is the meaning of <small>LAZY</small>? He said to them: You are holy. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THAT IS WHY YOU SAY: LET US GO AND SACRIFICE TO THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said (in Exod. 9:13): <small>GO EARLY IN THE MORNING</small> and make known to Pharaoh that he is nothing. &#x007B;See, he is going out to the water.&#x007D; (Exod. 9:13, cont., &#x0026; 14:) <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [<small>THE GOD OF THE HEBREWS</small>]: <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO TO WORSHIP ME. FOR THIS TIME &#x003C;I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES UPON YOUR HEART</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. He said to them: <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO TO WORSHIP ME</small>. Then it will be good for you; but if not, &#x003C;then&#x003E; <small>FOR THIS TIME &#x003C;I WILL SEND ALL MY PLAGUES UPON YOUR HEART&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It is written (in Job 36:22): <small>WHO IS A TEACHER LIKE HIM</small> (i.e., like the Holy One), who teaches the wicked to repent? He said to Pharaoh (in Exod. 9:19): <small>NOW SEND &#x003C;AND&#x003E; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &#x003C;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. And what is written (in vs. 18)? <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &#x003C;VERY HEAVY HAIL&#x003E;</small>,&#x2026;. Then after that I will bring the locust, as stated (in Exod. 10:4&#x2013;5): <small>BEHOLD, TOMORROW I WILL BRING LOCUSTS ON YOUR TERRITORY, AND THEY SHALL COVER THE EYE</small><sup><xref rid="fn223">102</xref></sup> <small>OF THE EARTH</small>. Our masters have said: Just as a woman has a head, so does the earth have a head. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 8:26): &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; <small>NOR THE HEAD OF THE DUST OF THE WORLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn224">103</xref></sup> And just as a woman has ears, so does the earth have ears. Thus it is stated (in Is. 1:2): <small>&#x003C;HEAR, O HEAVENS, &#x003E; AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>. And just as a woman has eyes, so does the earth have eyes. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 10:5): <small>AND THEY SHALL COVER THE EYE OF THE EARTH</small>. And just as a woman has a mouth, so does the earth have a mouth. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH &#x003C;AND SWALLOWED THEM</small>&#x2026;&#x003E;. And just as a woman has arms, so does the earth have arms. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 34:21): <small>FOR BEHOLD, THE LAND HAS BROAD ARMS</small>. And just as a woman has a navel, so does the land have a navel. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 38:12): <small>WHO DWELL ON THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH</small>. Just as a woman conceives and gives birth, so does the earth. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:8): <small>CAN A LAND PASS THROUGH LABOR IN A SINGLE DAY? IS A NATION BORN ALL AT ONCE? &#x003C;YET WHEN ZION WAS IN LABOR, SHE ALSO BORE HER CHILDREN. &#x003E;</small> This refers to Israel, because the Holy One brought them and had them enter Jerusalem <small>ALL AT ONCE</small>. And Jerusalem was astounded, as stated (in Is. 49:21): <small>AND YOU WILL SAY IN YOUR HEART: WHO HAS BORNE ME</small> &#x007B;<small>ALL</small>&#x007D; <small>THESE</small>? The Holy One said to them: By your life, in short while I am gathering your Dispersion, for so has Isaiah said (while addressing Zion in Is. 49:18): <small>LIFT UP YOUR EYES ROUND ABOUT AND SEE. THEY ARE ALL ASSEMBLED, ARE COME TO YOU</small>.</p>
<title>2.19 Exodus 9:13ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 9:22:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOLD OUT YOUR ARM TOWARD THE HEAVENS &#x003C;THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>,&#x003E;&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 115:3): <small>&#x003C;OUR GOD IS IN THE HEAVENS</small>;&#x003E; &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE</small>] <small>HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn225">104</xref></sup> The Holy One said (in vs. 16): <small>THE HEAVENS ARE HEAVENS BELONGING TO THE LORD, &#x003C;BUT THE EARTH HE GAVE OVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM&#x003E;</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who uttered a decree for the children of Rome not to go down to Syria and for the children of Syria not to go up to Rome. So it is with the Holy One. When he created [the beings on high, he said] (in Ps. 115:16): <small>THE HEAVENS ARE HEAVENS BELONGING TO THE LORD</small>, [<small>BUT THE EARTH HE GAVE OVER TO THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>]. When the Holy One wished to give Torah to Israel, he repealed the first decree and said: let those below ascend to those on high and those on high descend to those below. And I will be the one who begins. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:20): <small>AND THE LORD CAME DOWN UPON MOUNT SINAI</small>. It is also written (in Exod. 24:1): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO MOSES: GO UP UNTO THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 115:3) <small>THE LORD HE HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small> [in the heavens and on earth]. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; when he wanted &#x003C;that&#x003E; he said (in Gen. 1:9): <small>LET THE WATERS &#x003C;UNDER THE HEAVENS&#x003E; BE GATHERED &#x003C;UNTO ONE PLACE&#x003E;</small>. And &#x003C;it was&#x003E; when he wanted &#x003C;that&#x003E; he spoke and made the sea into dry ground, as stated (in Exod. 14:29): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT THROUGH THE SEA</small> [<small>ON DRY GROUND</small>],&#x2026;</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 115:3): <small>THE LORD HE HAS DONE WHATEVER HE PLEASED</small>. Thus the Holy One was not pleased to declare all creation guilty, as stated (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>&#x003C;FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO&#x003E; DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 9:22:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOLD OUT YOUR ARM &#x003C;TOWARD THE HEAVENS</small> &#x003E; [<small>THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>]. Why did he smite them with hail? Because the Egyptians thought that the Israelites were their vinedressers.<sup><xref rid="fn226">105</xref></sup> David said (in Ps. 78:47): <small>HE KILLED THEIR VINES WITH HAIL, AND THEIR SYCAMORES WITH <italic>HANAMAL</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn227">106</xref></sup> And how did it come down?

(Ps. 78:47:) <small>AND THEIR SYCAMORES WITH <italic>HANAMAL</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn229">108</xref></sup> It is written (in Exod. 9:32): <small>BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn230">109</xref></sup> It is simply that it came down upon each and every thing according to its power (to exhibit the wondrous works of Holy One): upon the cattle according to their power, upon the herbage according to its power, and upon humanity according to its power. What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 9:16)? <small>BUT NEVERTHELESS, FOR THIS REASON I HAVE PRESERVED YOU</small>,&#x2026; I have preserved you to recount my wondrous works.

<p>(Exod. 9:18:) <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &#x003C;VERY HEAVY HAIL&#x003E;</small>.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>SUCH AS HAS NEVER BEEN</small>. Nothing has happened like it, but it is going to happen to the nations. It is prepared for Sennacherib. &#x003C;These are&#x003E; the words of R. Simon. R. Hanina said: It is prepared for the punishment of Gog and Magog, as stated (concerning Gog in Ezek. 38:22): <small>AND I WILL POUR TORRENTIAL RAIN, HAILSTONES, &#x003C;FIRE, AND BRIMSTONE UPON HIM AND HIS HOSTS AND THE MANY PEOPLES THAT ARE WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn232">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 9:18:) <small>BEHOLD, AT THIS TIME TOMORROW I WILL RAIN DOWN &#x003C;VERY HEAVY HAIL&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. However (in Exod. 9:19 it says): <small>NOW SEND &#x003C;AND&#x003E; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &#x003C;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Our masters have said: during all the plagues, Pharaoh never said: <small>THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT</small>, except in the plague of the hail alone (in Exod. 9:27). Why? When someone wants to fight with his companion and overcome him, he comes upon him suddenly, kills him, and takes everything he has. But the Holy One said to Pharaoh (in Exod. 9:19): <small>NOW SEND &#x003C;AND&#x003E; BRING UNDER SHELTER YOUR LIVESTOCK &#x003C;AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; at that time &#x003C;that&#x003E; Pharaoh said: <small>THE LORD IS IN THE RIGHT</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 9:20:) <small>THOSE &#x003C;OF PHARAOH&#x2019;S SERVANTS&#x003E; WHO FEARED THE WORD OF THE LORD</small>. From here R. Simeon ben Johay said: &#x003C;In dealing with&#x003E; the best of snakes, crush its brain; and &#x003C;in dealing with&#x003E; the most worthy of the Egyptians, kill.<sup><xref rid="fn233">112</xref></sup> It is written (in Exod. 14:7): <small>THEN HE TOOK SIX HUNDRED SELECT CHARIOTS</small>. Where did they come from, in view of what is written (in Exod. 9:6): <small>THEN ALL THE EGYPTIAN LIVESTOCK DIED</small>&#x2026;? It is simply that (according to Exod. 9:20&#x2013;21): <small>THOSE</small> [<small>OF PHARAOH&#x2019;S SERVANTS</small>] <small>WHO FEARED THE WORD OF THE LORD HAD THEIR SERVANTS AND THEIR LIVESTOCK FLEE INTO THE HOUSES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn234">113</xref></sup> <small>BUT THOSE WHO PAID NO ATTENTION TO &#x003C;THE WORD OF THE LORD LEFT THEIR SERVANTS AND LIVESTOCK IN THE FIELD</small> &#x003E;. &#x003C;It was with reference to these that&#x003E; the Holy One said (to Moses in vs. 22): <small>HOLD OUT YOUR ARM TOWARD THE HEAVENS &#x003C;THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>2.21 Exodus 9:13ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND HAIL</small>&#x2026;. And why? By virtue of the Torah, which was &#x003C;also&#x003E; given in thunder. It is so stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE PERCEIVED THE THUNDERINGS</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD</small>, &#x003C;implies the Holy One&#x003E; and all &#x003C;his&#x003E; council,<sup><xref rid="fn235">114</xref></sup> for did they not decree that the hail come down upon Egypt?<sup><xref rid="fn236">115</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 9:23:) <small>AND THE LORD SENT THUNDER AND HAIL&#x2026;. AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN HAIL UPON THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. R. Hananyah said: <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MTR</small></italic>) <small>HAIL</small>. At first the Holy One sent down rain (<italic><small>MTR</small></italic>) upon them, &#x003C;but&#x003E; as it came down it became hail. It is so stated: <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MTR</small></italic>) <small>HAIL</small>. Why? Because no evil (such as hail) dwells with the Holy One. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; the rain &#x003C;that&#x003E; came down and &#x003C;then&#x003E; became hail when the wind entered it and turned it into hail. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 148:8): <small>STORM WIND THAT EXECUTES HIS COMMAND</small>. Ergo (in Exod. 9:23): <small>AS THE LORD RAINED DOWN HAIL</small>.</p>
<title>2.22 Exodus 9:13ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Exod. 9:24:) <small>SO THERE WAS HAIL AND FLASHING FIRE</small>. R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: A flash full of fire and after that, hail.<sup><xref rid="fn237">116</xref></sup> But our masters have said: Rain came down and became hail, while the fire came down with it.</p>
<p>It is written (in Exod. 9:32): <small>BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest and R. Judah bar Shallum differ.<sup><xref rid="fn238">117</xref></sup> R. Pinhas says: What is the meaning of <small>BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>)? The Holy One performed miracles (rt.: <italic><small>PL</small></italic>&#x2019;) through them. But R. Judah says: They were late crops. R. Pinhas said to him: But look, it is written (in Exod. 9:25): <small>THE HAIL SMOTE EVERY HERB OF THE FIELD</small>; yet you say: Because they were tiny they were not smitten. Rather the Holy One performed miracles through them. At that time, when Pharaoh saw this, he said to Moses: Pray for me. He said to him: &#x007B;(Exod. 8:5 [9]:) <small>YOU MAY HAVE THIS TRIUMPH OVER ME</small>; so I will let them go.&#x007D; In the first plague you said to me: Pray for me and I will let them go. Then I prayed, but you did not let them go. &#x007B;(Exod. 8:5 [9], cont.:) <small>FOR WHAT TIME SHALL I MAKE SUPPLICATION FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;?&#x007D; Pharaoh said to him (in Exod. 9:27): [<small>THIS TIME</small>] <small>I HAVE SINNED</small> &#x007B;<small>AGAINST THE LORD YOUR GOD AND AGAINST YOU</small>.&#x007D; Now I will let them go. As soon as Moses heard this, what is written (in vs. 33)? <small>SO LEAVING PHARAOH, MOSES WENT OUT OF THE CITY AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS UNTO THE LORD. &#x003C;THEN THE THUNDER AND THE HAIL CEASED&#x003E;</small>&#x2026; See how dear the righteous are to the Holy One&#x0021; For whatever they decide to do, the Holy One does &#x003C;for them&#x003E;. Our masters have said (in <italic>Ta&#x2018;an</italic>. 3:8):<sup><xref rid="fn239">118</xref></sup> Once upon a time Honi the Circle-Drawer prayed for rain to fall. He drew a circle and stood within it. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, your children have set their faces upon me, for here I am like a house child (i.e., a close friend) before you. I swear by your great name that I will not move from here until you have compassion upon your children. Immediately the rains came down. Now if Honi the Circle-Drawer, who was from the children of the children of Moses &#x003C; could do&#x003E; this, how much the more so in the case of Moses himself. Ergo (ibid.): <small>THEN THE THUNDER AND THE HAIL CEASED</small>, [<small>AND NO RAIN CAME POURING DOWN TO EARTH</small>]. And where is it to be found? Our masters have said: It is suspended in the air<sup><xref rid="fn240">119</xref></sup> until Gog and Magog come.<sup><xref rid="fn241">120</xref></sup> It is so stated (concerning Gog in Ezek. 38:22): <small>AND I WILL POUR TORRENTIAL RAIN, HAILSTONES, &#x003C;FIRE, AND BRIMSTONE UPON HIM AND HIS HOSTS AND THE MANY PEOPLES THAT ARE WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn242">121</xref></sup> Immediately (after Exod. 9:33 it says in vs. 34): <small>BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT THE RAIN AND THE HAIL &#x003C;AND THE THUNDER&#x003E; HAD CEASED, HE REVERTED TO SINNING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn243">122</xref></sup> So it is with the wicked. When they see that trouble has come upon them, they humble themselves; but as soon as the trouble passes and one feels relief, they return to their evil deeds. When Nebuchadnezzar saw trouble come upon him, he began giving praise to the Holy One. (Dan. 4:34 [37]:) <small>SO NOW I, NEBUCHADNEZZAR, PRAISE, EXALT, AND HONOR THE KING OF HEAVEN</small>&#x2026;. R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of R. Helbo, &#x003C;who spoke&#x003E; in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahman: Were it not for the fact that the Holy One judges the hearts and thoughts, would Nebuchadnezzar have given praise with one verse, just as David gave praise in his whole book? When Nebuchadnezzar saw himself &#x003C;to have&#x003E; greatness, he began to boast (in Dan. 4:1 [4] and 27 [30]): <small>I &#x003C;AM&#x003E; NEBUCHADNEZZAR,&#x2026; IS NOT THIS BABYLON THE GREAT &#x003C; WHICH I HAVE BUILT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;? The Holy One said to him: You wicked man, what are you boasting about? (Vs. 28 [31]:) <small>THE WORDS WERE STILL ON THE KING&#x2019;S LIPS, &#x003C;WHEN A VOICE FELL FROM HEAVEN&#x2026;: THE KINGDOM HAS PASSED FROM YOU&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. As long as the wicked see trouble coming upon them they are humble. When they see that it is going &#x003C;away&#x003E;, they return to their wickedness. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 9:34): <small>BUT WHEN PHARAOH SAW THAT &#x003C;THE RAIN AND THE HAIL AND THE THUNDER&#x003E; HAD CEASED, &#x003C;HE REVERTED TO SINNING&#x003E;</small>. The nations of the world continue to sin, but as for Israel (according to Lam. 4:22): <small>YOUR INIQUITY IS ENDED, O DAUGHTER OF ZION</small>. When? When he attends to the iniquity of the house of Edom, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>HE HAS ATTENDED TO YOUR INIQUITY, O DAUGHTER OF EDOM</small>. From now on Israel shall never go into exile.<sup><xref rid="fn244">123</xref></sup> Rather the Holy One shall gather them to Jerusalem, as stated (in Ps. 107:2&#x2013;3): <small>LET THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD SAY SO, THOSE WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED FROM THE HAND OF ADVERSITY; FOR HE HAS GATHERED THEM FROM THE LANDS, FROM THE EAST AND FROM THE WEST, FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE SEA</small>.</p>

In the biblical translations shod is usually rendered <small>DESTRUCTION</small> rather than <small>VIOLENCE</small>.

<title>Chapter 3 Exodus, Parashah III: <italic>Bo</italic></title>
<title>3.1 Exodus 10:21ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 10:21:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD THE HEAVENS &#x003C;THAT THERE MAY BE DARKNESS OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn245">1</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 105:28): <small>HE SENT DARKNESS, AND IT BECAME DARK</small>; [<small>FOR THEY DID NOT DEFY</small> (<italic>maru</italic>) <small>HIS WORD</small>]. The darkness which the Holy One sent upon Egypt was very severe. R. Aha said: &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because they did not accept the &#x007B;regulations <italic>middotaw</italic>&#x007D; [authority (<italic>marut</italic>)] of the Holy One over themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn246">2</xref></sup> Our Masters have said: What is the meaning of <small>THEY DID NOT DEFY</small> (<small>MRH</small>) <small>HIS WORD</small>? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; in reference to their having disregarded (rt.: <small>MRH</small>) the word of the Holy One. The Holy One said to the ministering angels: The Egyptians deserved to be smitten with darkness. Immediately they agreed and said: Yes. Not one of them rebelled (rt.: <small>MRH</small>) against the Holy One. (Ps. 105:28b:) <small>THEY DID NOT DEFY</small> (<small>MRH</small>) <small>HIS WORD</small>. (Vs. 28a:) <small>HE SENT DARKNESS, AND IT BECAME DARK</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king whose servant sinned against him. So he said to someone: Go and give him fifty lashes. He went and gave him a hundred. Thus he increased &#x003C;the punishment &#x003E; on his own. So did the Holy One send darkness over Egypt, and the darkness increased. (Ibid.:) <small>HE SENT DARKNESS, AND IT BECAME</small> &#x003C;even more&#x003E; <small>DARK</small>.</p>
<title>3.2 Exodus 10:21ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 10:21:) <small>STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD THE HEAVENS &#x003C;THAT THERE MAY BE DARKNESS OVER THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. Where did the darkness come from? R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree.<sup><xref rid="fn247">3</xref></sup> R. Judah says: From the darkness above, as stated (in Ps. 18:12 [11]): <small>HE MADE DARKNESS HIS HIDING PLACE</small>. R. Nehemiah says: From the darkness of Gehinnom, as stated (in Job 10:22): <small>A LAND OF UTTER DARKNESS, LIKE THE DARKNESS OF &#x003C;THE SHADOW OF DEATH, WITHOUT ORDER</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn248">4</xref></sup> R. Joshua ben Levi said: In three places we hear that a person makes known his teaching near to his death. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 22:20&#x2013;21): <small>&#x003C;DID I NOT WRITE DOWN FOR YOU A THREE-FOLD</small><sup><xref rid="fn249">5</xref></sup> <small>LORE&#x2026;&#x003E; TO MAKE KNOWN TO YOU FAITHFUL AND TRUE WORDS, IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ANSWER TRUE WORDS TO THOSE WHO SENT YOU</small>? So also Solomon said (in Eccl. 12:13): <small>&#x003C;HERE IS&#x003E; THE END OF THE MATTER WHEN EVERYTHING HAS BEEN HEARD</small>: <small>&#x003C;FEAR GOD, KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, FOR THIS COMPRISES THE WHOLE PERSON</small>. &#x003E; What (in Job 10:22) is the meaning of <small>THE SHADOW OF DEATH &#x003C; WITHOUT ORDER</small>&#x003E;? When someone is in the shadow of death, he puts his teaching in order. R. Tanhuma bar Abba [said]: When one comes to pass away, his ministering angels say (Ps. 68:35 [34]) to him: <small>ASCRIBE POWER TO GOD</small>&#x2026;. So also it says (in Ezek. 31:15): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [<small>GOD</small>]: <small>IN THE DAY THAT HE WENT DOWN TO SHEOL, &#x003C;I CAUSED HIM TO MOURN; I COVERED HIM WITH THE DEEP</small>&#x003E;. Ergo (in Job 10:22): <small>A LAND OF UTTER DARKNESS, LIKE THE DARKNESS OF &#x003C;THE SHADOW OF DEATH, WITHOUT ORDER</small>&#x003E;. R. Judah says: With what are the wicked covered when they go down to Sheol?<sup><xref rid="fn250">6</xref></sup> With darkness. Hezekiah said: In the case of a vat, with what does one cover it? With a lid of earthenware, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; of the same material.<sup><xref rid="fn251">7</xref></sup> Just as &#x003C;the vat&#x003E; is of earthenware, so one covers it with nothing but earthenware. So &#x003C;also&#x003E; it is with the wicked. What is written about them (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>&#x2026;. And therefore the Holy One brings them down to Sheol, which is darkness, and covers them with the deep, for it &#x003C;also&#x003E; is darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>. Here is the same darkness which came upon Egypt. It came from the midst of Gehinnom. And how thick was this darkness?<sup><xref rid="fn252">8</xref></sup> Our masters have said: As thick as a denarius<sup><xref rid="fn253">9</xref></sup> of Gordianus &#x007B;i.e., the name of a place&#x007D;, <small>EVEN</small> (according to Exod. 10:21) <small>A DARKNESS THAT CAN BE FELT</small>.</p>
<title>3.3 Exodus 10:21ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 10:22:) <small>AND THERE WAS THICK DARKNESS IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT FOR THREE DAYS</small>. There were &#x003C; actually &#x003E; seven days of darkness over the Egyptians.<sup><xref rid="fn254">10</xref></sup> For the first three days whoever was sitting and wanted to stand would stand, and whoever was standing and wanted to sit would sit. Then for the next three days whoever was sitting was unable to stand and whoever was &#x007B;sitting&#x007D; [standing] was unable to sit.<sup><xref rid="fn255">11</xref></sup> Here are six &#x003C;days&#x003E;. And which day was the seventh? The one of which it is stated (in Exod. 14:20): <small>THUS THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS WHICH LIT UP THE NIGHT</small>. The cloud was in Egypt; and while it gave light to Israel, it was darkened for Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>BUT ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LIGHT IN THEIR DWELLINGS</small>. Now, Israel entered the houses of the Egyptians, and whatever the Egyptians had, Israel searched out and looked at &#x003C;them&#x003E;. So, when the Holy One said to Israel (in Exod. 3:22): <small>BUT EACH WOMAN SHALL BORROW &#x003C; OBJECTS OF SILVER, OBJECTS OF GOLD, AND CLOTHING &#x003E; FROM HER NEIGHBOR AND FROM THE WOMAN WHO SOJOURNS IN HER HOUSE</small>&#x2026;, Israel entered in among the Egyptians. Then, when each and every one would say to his companion and neighbor: Lend me that object which you have, and when he would say: I do not have it, he would say: I know that you have it, and here it is in your chest. See, it is in such and such a place. I saw it in your hand. So he lent him that object. And how did Israel know this? It is simply that in those days of darkness they had entered their houses and seen their silver, their gold, and whatever objects they had. R. Abbin the Levite said: Also when the plague of blood came over the Egyptians,<sup><xref rid="fn256">12</xref></sup> the Nile was turned into blood, as stated (in Exod. 7:24): <small>AND ALL THE EGYPTIANS DUG AROUND THE NILE FOR WATER TO DRINK, &#x003C; BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF THE NILE</small>&#x003E;. What did they do? They saw Israel filling its casks from the Nile. So they went after them and sought water to drink from them, but it became blood within their mouths. R. Abbin said: Whatever they bought from Israel for a price they drank as water. Since it is impossible for anyone to exist without water, they bought water from Israel and thereby enriched Israel. [So also here, when the plague of darkness came upon them, they were acquainted with the Egyptians&#x2019; houses and thereby &#x003C;the Egyptians &#x003E; made Israel rich.]</p>
<title>3.4 Exodus 10:21ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 10:21:) <small>STRETCH OUT YOUR HAND TOWARD THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One brought the plagues upon them in the order<sup><xref rid="fn257">13</xref></sup> of a flesh-and-blood [king]. In the case of a flesh-and-blood king, when a state revolts against him, what does he do? He sends out legions<sup><xref rid="fn258">14</xref></sup> which surround it. First he &#x007B;smashes&#x007D; [dams up] their aqueduct.<sup><xref rid="fn259">15</xref></sup> If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings &#x003C;war&#x003E; cries against them. [If they repent, well and good; but if not, he shoots arrows at them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings &#x003C;the&#x003E; legions against them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he brings hand-to-hand combat<sup><xref rid="fn260">16</xref></sup> against them.] If they repent, well and good; but if not, he hurls naphtha<sup><xref rid="fn261">17</xref></sup> at them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he hurls stones at them from a catapult.<sup><xref rid="fn262">18</xref></sup> Then, if they repent, well and good; but if not, he stirs up &#x007B;six legions&#x007D; a lot of troops<sup><xref rid="fn263">19</xref></sup> against them. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he binds them in prison. If they repent, well and good; but if not, he kills their noble ones. So did the Holy One come against the Egyptians in the order of kings. First he &#x007B;smashed&#x007D; [dammed up] their aqueduct, as stated (in Ps. 78:44): <small>HE TURNED THEIR NILES</small><sup><xref rid="fn264">20</xref></sup> <small>INTO BLOOD &#x003C;SO THAT THEIR STREAMS WERE UNDRINKABLE</small>&#x003E;. When they did not repent, he brought &#x003C;war&#x003E; cries against them. These were the frogs, as stated (in Exod. 8:8): <small>&#x003C;THEN MOSES CRIED OUT TO THE LORD&#x003E; ABOUT THE MATTER OF THE FROGS</small>&#x2026;. Then, when they did not repent, he brought arrows upon them. These were the gnats, as stated (in Exod. 8:13 [17]): <small>AND THERE WERE GNATS</small> [<small>UPON HUMAN AND UPON BEAST</small>], for &#x003C;each of them &#x003E; entered an Egyptian body like an arrow. [Then, when they did not repent, he brought &#x003C;the&#x003E; legions upon them. These were swarms of flies, as stated (in Ps. 78:45): <small>HE SENT SWARMS OF INSECTS AMONG THEM TO DEVOUR THEM</small>. Then, when they did not repent, he brought hand-to-hand combat upon them, as stated. This is the plague.]<sup><xref rid="fn265">21</xref></sup> Then, when they did not repent, he hurled naphtha at them. &#x003C;This corresponds to&#x003E; the boils. Then, when they did not repent, he hurled stones at them from a catapult. This is the hail. Then when they did not repent even after that, he stirred up a lot of troops against them. These were the locusts. Then after that he put them in prison. [This is the darkness,] as stated (in Exod. 10:21): <small>DARKNESS THAT CAN BE TOUCHED</small>&#x2026;. Then, when they did not repent, he killed all their eldest sons, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN</small>.</p>
<title>3.5 Exodus 10:21ff., Part V</title>
<p>Whatever the Egyptians devised against Israel, [the Holy One] brought against them. Those &#x003C; Egyptians &#x003E; devised for them to draw their water. What is written (in Ps. 78:44)? <small>HE TURNED THEIR NILES INTO BLOOD SO THAT THEIR STREAMS WERE UNDRINKABLE</small>. Those &#x003C; Egyptians &#x003E; devised for them to be laden as traveling traders.<sup><xref rid="fn266">22</xref></sup> He sent frogs upon them and covered them with resin. Those &#x003C; Egyptians &#x003E; devised for them to work on the land. The Holy One made the land swarm with gnats. Those &#x003C;Egyptians&#x003E; devised that they should bear their children as a <italic>paidagogos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn267">23</xref></sup> He sent lions, wolves, and bears among them. &#x003C;If&#x003E; an Egyptian had ten children, when he told Israel to bring them to the market place, the lion came and took one, the wolf one, the bear one, the leopard one, and the snake one. Then he came &#x003C;back&#x003E; to the Egyptian alone. The Egyptian said: Where are my children? Israel said to him: Sit down and I myself will render you an accounting: The lion took one &#x003C;etc.&#x003E;; and so &#x003C;he continued&#x003E; on, until he had given him an accounting. Now they (the Egyptians) devised that they would tend their livestock, but he sent out the plague among them, as stated (in Exod. 9:6): <small>THEN ALL THE EGYPTIAN LIVESTOCK DIED</small>. They intended that they would be bath attendants &#x007B;bathe them&#x007D;. He brought the boils upon them. They intended to stone them with stones. The Holy One brought the hail upon them, as stated (in Exod. 9:22): <small>THAT THERE MAY BE HAIL &#x003C;IN ALL THE LAND OF EGYPT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. They intended that they would be their vine dressers. The Holy One brought the locusts, who ate their trees, as stated (in Exod. 10:15): <small>AND THEY ATE ALL THE GRASS OF THE EARTH</small>&#x2026;. They intended to imprison them in prison. The Holy One brought darkness upon them, as stated (in Exod. 10:23): <small>THEY COULD NOT SEE ONE ANOTHER</small>&#x2026;. They intended to kill them. The Holy One killed their first-born, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN</small>. They intended to drown them in water. The Holy One also drowned them in water, as stated (in Ps. 136:15): <small>BUT OVERTHREW PHARAOH AND HIS HOST IN THE REED SEA</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.6 Exodus 10:21ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Now all the plagues which the Holy One brought upon the Egyptians, he is going to bring upon Edom (i.e., Rome). It is so stated (in Is. 23:5): <small>&#x003C;AS AT THE REPORT CONCERNING EGYPT</small>, &#x003E; <small>THEY SHALL TREMBLE AT THE REPORT OF TYRE</small> (<italic><small>TsR</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn268">24</xref></sup> R. Eleazar has said: When Tyre is written with a vowel letter (i.e., <small><italic>TsWR</italic></small>), what is written is speaking about the region of Tyre. But in every place in which it is written as <italic><small>TsR</small></italic> without the <italic><small>W</small></italic>, what is written is speaking about this wicked Roman Empire, because it is oppressing Israel (rt.: <small><italic>Ts</italic>RR</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn269">25</xref></sup> In Egypt he brought the plague of blood upon them. So also shall it be in Edom (i.e., Rome), as stated (in Joel 3:3&#x2013;4 [2:30&#x2013;31]): <small>THEN I WILLSET PORTENTS IN THE HEAVENS AND ON THE EARTH: BLOOD, FIRE, &#x003C;AND PILLARS OF SMOKE; THE SUN SHALL BE TURNED INTO DARKNESS &#x003E; AND THE MOON INTO BLOOD</small>. In Egypt he brought frogs upon them because their voice (<italic>qol</italic>) was strong. So also shall it be in Edom, as stated (in Is. 66:6): <small>A SOUND</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF TUMULT FROM THE CITY</small>, <small>&#x003C;A NOISE</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>FROM THE TEMPLE</small>&#x0021; <small>THE THUNDER</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF THE LORD IS REPAYING RETRIBUTION TO HIS ENEMIES</small>&#x003E;. In Egypt he brought gnats upon them.

For that reason she was named Miriam, because of the bitterness (<italic>merur</italic>).</p>

The Holy One said to them: Why are you sitting &#x003C;there&#x003E;? (In the words of Cant. 2:10) <small>ARISE</small>. The wicked are dead and the mediocre ones have repented. <small>ARISE</small>, (for in the words of Exod. 12:2): In <small>THIS MONTH</small> you are being redeemed.</p>
<title>3.8 Exodus 12:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH</small>. This text is related (to Job. 6:11&#x2013;12): <small>WHAT IS MY STRENGTH THAT I SHOULD WAIT</small>? <small>&#x003C;WHAT IS MY END THAT I SHOULD BE PATIENT</small>? &#x003E; <small>IS MY STRENGTH THE STRENGTH OF STONES</small>? &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>IS MY FLESH BRONZE</small>?

The Holy One said to them: As you live, &#x007B;however&#x007D; [whatever you hoped for while] you were enslaved, in <small>THIS MONTH</small> you are being redeemed.</p>
<p>What is written above (in Exod. 11:9) on the matter? <small>NOW THE LORD HAD SAID UNTO MOSES: PHARAOH WILL NOT HEARKEN UNTO YOU</small>&#x2026;. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree. R. Judah says: This parashah says at the beginning of the plagues (in Exod. 7:4): <small>PHARAOH WILL NOT HEARKEN UNTO YOU</small>. But R. Nehemiah says: &#x003C;The warning&#x003E; is stated in its &#x003C;present&#x003E; place (in Exod. 11:9, which continues): <small>&#x003C;IN ORDER THAT MY WONDERS MAY BE MULTIPLIED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>, &#x003E; in the sea more than in Egypt. (Exod. 11:10) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON PERFORMED ALL THESE WONDERS</small>&#x2026;. The Holy one wished to credit this parashah to Moses alone.<sup><xref rid="fn281">37</xref></sup> The Holy One said to it: You have taught well. As you (Moses and Aaron) live, I am crediting it to both of you. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 12:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON</small> &#x2026;</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH &#x003C;SHALL BE TO YOU THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTHS</small>&#x2026;&#x003E;. The Holy One said: From the time that I created my world, I bore the burden of calculating [the computations] of the months. From now on it is being given over to you. (Exod. 12:2:) <small>TO YOU</small> it is being given over, but you are not being given over into its hands.</p>
<p>A story about R. Hiyya the Great: &#x003C;Once&#x003E; when the moon had arisen on the eve of the New Year (i.e. when there was supposed to be a new moon), the cattle drovers traveled in its light for a distance of three miles.<sup><xref rid="fn283">39</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; R. Hiyya saw that &#x003C;moon&#x003E;, he took pebbles and dust and threw them at it. He said: Tomorrow we were intending to revive (rt.: <italic><small>HDSh</small></italic>) you (as a new moon), but now you have risen on your own. Immediately it was swallowed up in its place. Why? Because it was under his authority.<sup><xref rid="fn284">40</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.9 Exodus 12:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 12:2:) <small>THIS MONTH</small> (i.e. <small>THIS MOON</small>) <small>SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>. You reckon by months (i.e. by moons), but the nations of the world reckon by days. R. Abbin the Levite said: It is a universal custom for the great (<italic>gadol</italic>) to reckon by the great and for the small, by the small. Esau, who is older (<italic>gadol</italic>), as stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>HER OLDER SON &#x003C;ESAU&#x003E;</small>, reckons by the sun, which is the greater &#x003C;light&#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>THE GREATER</small> (<italic>gadol</italic>) <small>LIGHT &#x003C;TO RULE THE DAY</small>&#x003E;. Jacob, who is called younger (<italic>qatan</italic>), as stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>HER YOUNGER SON &#x003C;JACOB</small>&#x003E; reckons by the lesser (<italic>qatan</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; by the moon, as stated (in Gen. 1:16): <small>AND THE LESSER LIGHT &#x003C;TO RULE THE NIGHT</small> &#x003E;. Ergo (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH</small> [<small>SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>].</p>

<p>[(Exod. 12:2:) <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>).]<sup><xref rid="fn285">41</xref></sup> R. Samuel bar Abba said: In the case of any new moon which appears at six hours (i.e., noon) or earlier, the eye has the power to see it. At six hours or later the eye does not have the power to see it.<sup><xref rid="fn286">42</xref></sup> Now that new moon, when the Holy One spoke to Moses, began at six hours or later; and the eye did not have the power to see it. So the Holy One showed it to him with a finger<sup><xref rid="fn287">43</xref></sup> and said to him (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn288">44</xref></sup></p>

<p>[(Exod. 12:2:) <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>).] R. Judah &#x007B;ben&#x007D; [bar] Simeon says: What is <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (<small>THIS MONTH</small>)? To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn289">45</xref></sup> To a king who had taken many wives but did not write marriage contracts<sup><xref rid="fn290">46</xref></sup> for them; nor &#x003C;did he record&#x003E; consulship<sup><xref rid="fn291">47</xref></sup> (to indicate the year), month, or Sabbath (i.e., week). He saw a certain daughter of good family, even a daughter of &#x003C; noble &#x003E; stock. So for her he wrote a marriage contract and &#x003C;recorded&#x003E; consulship, month, Sabbath, and leap year (i.e., one with a second month of Adar inserted). Similarly did the Holy One say: When I created my world, the peoples of the world arose. I gave them neither new moon, Sabbath, nor leap year; but when Israel arose, to them I gave new moons (i.e., months) and leap years. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (<small>THIS MONTH</small>).</p>
<title>3.12 Exodus 12:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>) <small>&#x003C;BELONGS TO YOU</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn292">48</xref></sup> R.

He did nothing;<sup><xref rid="fn295">51</xref></sup> but as soon as his son became of age, he said to him: My son, up to now this time piece has been in my hands. From now on it is transferred to you. Similarly the Holy One had sanctified new moons and leap years. As soon as Israel arose, he said to them: Until now the reckoning of new moons and leap years has been in my hands. See here, from now on they are being transferred to you, as stated (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>) <small>BELONGS TO YOU</small>.</p>
<title>3.13 Exodus 12:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said: When Israel arrives at (i.e., determines the time for) New Year&#x2019;s Day, the Holy One says to his ministering angels:<sup><xref rid="fn296">52</xref></sup> Raise up the tribunal,<sup><xref rid="fn297">53</xref></sup> and bring &#x007B;back&#x007D; [out] the books. Then they say: Why? And he says: Because I wish to judge my children tomorrow when it is New Year&#x2019;s Day. They immediately raise up &#x007B;bring out&#x007D; a tribunal [and bring out] the books. An earthly court has made a determination to proclaim &#x003C;a leap year&#x003E;. It says tomorrow we are celebrating New Year&#x2019;s Day. The ministering angels say to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, you did not tell us: Tomorrow is New Year&#x2019;s Day. He said to them: The reckoning is in their hands, as stated (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS NEW MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>) <small>BELONGS TO YOU</small>; it is transferred to you. As for you and me, let us go to my children, so that whatever they do, we may go along with them. Moses said (in Deut. 4:7): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR</small>] <small>WHAT GREAT NATION IS THERE WHO HAS A GOD SO NEAR TO IT AS IS THE LORD OUR GOD WHENEVER WE PROCLAIM ON HIS BEHALF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn298">54</xref></sup> Now the word <small>PROCLAIM</small> (rt.: <small>QR</small>&#x2019;) is only &#x003C;used in reference to&#x003E; festival times. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 23:4): [<small>THESE ARE THE FESTIVAL TIMES OF THE LORD</small>&#x2026;,]<sup><xref rid="fn299">55</xref></sup> <small>THE HOLY ASSEMBLIES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QR</small></italic>&#x2019;), <small>&#x003C;WHICH YOU SHALL PROCLAIM</small> (rt.: <small>QR</small>&#x2019;) <small>AT THEIR APPOINTED TIME</small>&#x003E;.

<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MOON</small> (i.e., <small>THIS MONTH</small>). If you are worthy, you will be keeping the records of its (i.e., Israel&#x2019;s) waxing &#x003C;stronger&#x003E;:<sup><xref rid="fn303">59</xref></sup> Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, [Judah], Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz, Jesse, David, and Solomon. <small>THEN</small> (according to I Chron. 29:23) <small>SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD</small>. But if not, you will be keeping the records of its waning: Rehoboam, &#x007B;Abijah&#x007D;. Then after Rehoboam they began to wane and pass away. Solomon made shields of gold; but when Rehoboam arose, he made them of bronze, as stated (in I Kings 14:27): <small>THEN KING REHOBOAM MADE SHIELDS OF BRONZE IN PLACE OF THEM</small>. They began to diminish: &#x007B;Rehoboam&#x007D;, Ahijah, Asa, Jehoshaphat, &#x007B;<small>JUDAH</small>,&#x007D; [Jehoram], Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, Josiah, and Zedekiah. [It is also written (in II Kings 25:7):] <small>THEN HE PUT OUT ZEDEKIAH&#x2019;S EYES</small>. Ergo: The moon was in its decline. The moon set; they began to walk in darkness. The people of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, how long will the worldly darkness remain upon us, and the light belong to the peoples of the world? The Holy One said: [By your life, In the world to come I am bringing darkness to the nations of the world] and the light to you. Isaiah has said (in Is. 60:2): <small>FOR BEHOLD, DARKNESS SHALL COVER THE EARTH, AND THICK CLOUDS THE PEOPLES.

So he went out and slept on the threshing floor. &#x003C;He did so&#x003E; in order to ward off the lawless. However (according to Ruth 3:3), <small>YOU</small> (Ruth) <small>ARE TO WASH AND ANOINT YOURSELF</small>. She did not do so. Rather Ruth was extremely pure. She said: Whatever woman saw me thus would say: This is a whore. What did she do (according to vs. 6)? <small>SHE WENT DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR AND DID JUST AS HER MOTHER-IN-LAW HAD COMMANDED HER</small>. &#x003C;It was only&#x003E; after she went down, &#x003C;that&#x003E; she did everything that her mother-in-law had commanded her.</p>
<p>(Ruth 3:7): <small>THEN, WHEN BOAZ HAD EATEN AND DRUNK, AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn310">66</xref></sup> That he ate sweets after his meal, because types of sweets accustom the tongue to the Torah.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ruth 3:7): <small>AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>. That he labored in the Torah, as stated (in Ps. 119:72): <small>THE LAW OF YOUR MOUTH IS BETTER FOR ME</small>. (Ruth 3:7, cont.:) <small>AND WHEN HE CAME TO LIE DOWN BESIDE THE GRAIN PILE</small>, [<small>THEN SHE CAME SECRETLY</small>.] <small>SECRETLY</small> &#x003C;means&#x003E; quietly.</p>
<p>(Ruth 3:7&#x2013;8, cont.:) <small>UNCOVERED HIS FEET, AND LAY DOWN. NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT</small>&#x2026;., &#x003C;i.e., &#x003E; when he arose to engage in the study of the Torah, (ibid. cont.:) <small>THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO HE TURNED ASIDE</small> (rt.: <small>LPT</small>), <small>&#x003C;AND HERE WAS A WOMAN LYING AT HIS FEET</small>&#x003E;. When he went to cry out, she immediately seized him. Now this word (rt.: <small>LPT</small>) is simply a word for clasping, as stated (in Jud. 16:29): <small>AND SAMSON EMBRACED</small> (rt.: <small>LPT</small>) <small>&#x003C;THE TWO MIDDLE PILLARS</small>&#x003E;. What is the meaning of <small>WAS STARTLED</small>? He imagined that she might be a spirit or a demon (<italic>mazziq</italic>). He put his hand upon her head and found her to be a woman, for the demons (<italic>shedim</italic>) have no hair.<sup><xref rid="fn311">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ruth 3:9&#x2013;10:) <small>THEN HE SAID: WHO ARE YOU, AND SHE SAID: I AM YOUR HANDMAID RUTH</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>SO HE SAID: MAY YOU BE BLESSED OF THE LORD, MY DAUGHTER</small>. It was not enough for her that he did not curse her. Instead he blessed her. (Ruth 3:10, cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE MADE YOUR LAST ACT OF KINDNESS BETTER THAN THE FIRST</small>. Thus did Boaz explain: Whom does a woman love? A poor young man more than a rich old man. Now I am eighty years old; yet she has come to me to sanctify the Name of Names. He began to bless her. He said to her (in vs. 13): <small>SPEND THE NIGHT</small>&#x2026;. [<small>IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU</small> (from a childless marriage), <small>GOOD</small>]. <small>&#x003C;LET HIM REDEEM;&#x003E; BUT IF HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO REDEEM YOU, &#x003C;THEN I MYSELF WILL REDEEM YOU</small>&#x003E;. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The evil drive came to him. It said to him: You are unmarried and she is unmarried. Take her. Immediately he bound his drive by an oath and said to it (in vs. 13): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>, I will not touch her. R. Huna said: She said to him: Are you dismissing me with words? He said to her: <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>, I am not dismissing you with words. David said: I am obliged to give thanks to you for the miracles which you have done with my great grandfather and my great grandmother at night. Ergo (in Ps. 119:62): <small>AT MIDNIGHT I WILL ARISE TO THANK YOU</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 119:62): <small>AT MIDNIGHT</small>. It speaks about Israel. While they were lying upon their beds in Egypt, the Holy One waged war for them, as stated (in Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.17 Exodus 12:29ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 44:26): <small>&#x003C;HE&#x003E; CONFIRMS THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn312">68</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Levi: What is the meaning of <small>CONFIRMS THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT</small>? Do we not know that (ibid., cont.) <small>HE SAYS TO JERUSALEM: YOU SHALL BE INHABITED, AND TO THE CITIES OF JUDAH: THEY SHALL BE REBUILT</small>? It is simply that a certain angel appeared to our ancestor Jacob. He said to him: What is your name? He told him: Jacob. <small>&#x003C;THEN HE SAID</small>&#x003E; (in Gen. 32:29 [28]): <small>YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE JACOB, &#x003C;BUT ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Is. 44:26, cont.:) <small>AND FULFILLS THE COUNSEL OF HIS MESSENGERS</small>. The Holy One appeared to Jacob to affirm the command of his angel, <small>AND</small> (in Gen. 35:10) <small>GOD SAID TO HIM: YOUR NAME IS JACOB. &#x003C;YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE JACOB, BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ISRAEL</small>. &#x003E; In the case of Jerusalem, over which all the prophets have prophesied, how much the more &#x003C;will the Holy One confirm (i.e., fulfill) their prophecies&#x003E;?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 44:26): <small>&#x003C;HE&#x003E; CONFIRMS THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT</small>. This is Moses, about whom it is stated (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO</small><sup><xref rid="fn313">69</xref></sup> <small>WITH MY SERVANT MOSES &#x003C;&#x2026;. WITH HIM I WILL SPEAK MOUTH TO MOUTH</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E; (Is. 44:26, cont.:) <small>AND FULFILLS THE COUNSEL OF HIS MESSENGERS</small>. This is Moses of whom it is stated (in Numb. 20:16): <small>AND HE</small> (the Holy One) <small>SENT A MESSENGER WHO BROUGHT US OUT FROM EGYPT</small>. The Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 12:12): Go&#x0021; Say to Israel: <small>I WILL PASS THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003C;ON THIS NIGHT AND WILL SMITE EVERY FIRST-BORN IN THE LANDOF EGYPT</small>&#x2026;. &#x003E; Moses went and said to Israel (according to Exod. 11:4): <small>ABOUT MIDNIGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn314">70</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Now have I not already promised Moses and said (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT MOSES; &#x003C;HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE</small>&#x003E;? Did I not say so? And is my servant Moses to seem like a liar? Rather, even as Moses said (in Exod. 11:4): <small>ABOUT MIDNIGHT</small>, so I will act at midnight to confirm the decree of Moses. Ergo (in Is. 44:26): <small>&#x003C;HE&#x003E; CONFIRMS THE WORD OF HIS SERVANT</small>. Therefore (in Exod. 12:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. &#x003C;Exod. 11:4; 12:29 also&#x003E; teaches that the night &#x003C;generally&#x003E; divides on its own, but he (i.e., the Holy One) divided it like a thread of hair.<sup><xref rid="fn315">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT &#x003C;THAT THE LORD</small> (literally: <small>AND THE LORD</small>)&#x2026;.&#x003E;. R. Eleazar ben Padat said: Wherever it is stated: <small>AND THE LORD</small>, &#x003C;these words imply&#x003E; him and his council.<sup><xref rid="fn316">72</xref></sup> The Holy One sat over them in judgment, and the law court on high decreed that the first-born of Egypt should be smitten (with the plague). Therefore (in Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, &#x003C;AND THE LORD</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Resh Laqish said: It teaches that before the plague (<italic>makkah</italic>) there was another blow (<italic>makkah</italic>). How so? Whenever the Holy One wished to bring a plague upon the Egyptians, he would dispatch Moses and say to him: Go and tell them that I am bringing such and such and such a plague upon them. So when the plague of the first-born was coming, Moses said to them (in Exod. 11:4): <small>ABOUT MIDNIGHT</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</p>
<title>3.18 Exodus 12:29ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 11:5:) <small>AND EVERY FIRST-BORN &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E; SHALL DIE</small>. All the first-born came together with their fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn317">73</xref></sup> &#x003C;The first-born&#x003E; said to &#x003C; their fathers &#x003E;: Whatever Moses has said he has brought upon us. Do you not wish us to live? Rather come and let us have these &#x007B;slaves&#x007D; [Hebrews] go away from among us; for if we do not, we are dead. They answered them and said to them: Even if all the Egyptians die, they will not go away from here. What did they do? All the first-born came together and went to Pharaoh. They cried out unto Pharaoh and said to him: Please have this people go away, for because of them evil will come &#x007B;over them and over him&#x007D; [over us and over you]. He said to his servants: Get going and beat those &#x003C;people&#x003E; on the legs. What did the first-born do? Immediately, when they had gone out, each and every one of them took his sword and killed his father. It is so stated (in Ps. 136:10): <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE EGYPT THROUGH THEIR FIRST-BORN</small>. &#x201C;To the one who smote the first-born of Egypt&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE EGYPT THROUGH THEIR FIRST-BORN</small>. After they had killed their fathers, the Holy One appeared [over them] and killed them, as stated (in Exod. 12:29): <small>&#x003C;AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT &#x003E; THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN, &#x003C;FROM THE FIRST-BORN OF PHARAOH, WHO WAS SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, TO THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CAPTIVE WHO WAS IN THE DUNGEON, AND ALL THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CATTLE</small>.&#x003E; If the first-born of the Egyptians had sinned, how had the captives sinned?<sup><xref rid="fn318">74</xref></sup> It is simply that they had &#x007B;said and rejoiced&#x007D; [rejoiced and said]: We may remain in slavery, but do not let Israel get away from here. For that reason he killed them (according to Exod. 12:29): <small>TO THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CAPTIVE</small>. &#x003C;The same applies&#x003E; all the more to first-born of the bondmaid, since they were oppressors. But why were <small>THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CATTLE</small> killed? Because the Egyptians were bowing down to the lambs. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; so they would not say: Our idolatry is too strong for him to have dominion over it with divine retribution. [Therefore (in Exod. 12:29): <small>AND ALL THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CATTLE</small>.]</p>
<title>3.19 Exodus 12:29ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 12:30:) <small>AND PHARAOH NIGHT AROSE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn319">75</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>NIGHT</small>? That he (Pharaoh) was dark &#x007B;in&#x007D; [like] the night.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE AND ALL HIS SERVANTS</small>. He was dark and they were dark.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CRY</small>&#x2026;. How so? When an Egyptian marries five women, he has five first-born from them; and likewise when a woman is married to five men, she has from them five first-born &#x007B;from them&#x007D;. So all of them died. It was in order to confirm what is stated (in Exod. 11:5): <small>AND EVERY FIRST-BORN &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E; SHALL DIE</small>. Moreover, a house in which there was no first-born had an outcry &#x007B;greater than the house&#x007D; [as great as in the house] in which there was a first-born, because the master of the house was &#x003C;himself&#x003E; a first-born,<sup><xref rid="fn320">76</xref></sup> as stated (in Ps. 89:28 [27]): <small>I WILL ALSO APPOINT HIM FIRST-BORN</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 12:30): <small>BECAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CRY IN EGYPT; FOR THERE WAS NO HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS NOT SOMEONE DEAD</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 12:31:) <small>AND HE CALLED MOSES AND AARON &#x003C;IN THE NIGHT&#x003E;</small>. He (Pharaoh) went &#x003C;about&#x003E; calling them during the night in every single street and was saying: Where is Moses, and where does he live?<sup><xref rid="fn321">77</xref></sup> But the children of Israel were mocking him and saying to him: Where are you going, Pharaoh? When he said to them: I am looking for Moses, they said to him: Here is where he lives. So they mocked him until he stood before him (i.e., Moses). [Pharaoh said to him] (ibid., cont.): <small>ARISE AND GO AWAY FROM AMONG MY PEOPLE</small>. Moses said to him: Are we thieves? The Holy One has said (in Exod. 12:22): <small>NONE OF YOU SHALL GO OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF HIS HOUSE UNTIL MORNING</small>. Pharaoh said to him: Will you please arise &#x003C;and&#x003E; leave&#x0021; Moses said to him: Why are you going to so much trouble? He said to him: Because I am a first-born, and I am afraid I may die. Moses said to him: Do not be afraid of &#x003C;this&#x003E; thing. You are destined for something greater than this. Now you are not to say that Pharaoh alone was urging &#x003C; Israel to leave &#x003E;; rather all the Egyptians were urging &#x003C;them to leave&#x003E;. It is so stated (in Exod. 12:33): <small>AND THE EGYPTIANS PRESSED &#x003C;THE PEOPLE ON, TO SEND THEM OUT OF THE LAND IN HASTE</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. The Holy One said to them: By your life, none of you shall die here but in the sea. Why did all of them not die from the plague of the first-born, but in the sea? R. Samuel bar Nahman said: &#x003C;It&#x003E; was through guile &#x003C;that&#x003E; the Egyptians came upon Israel. They said: If we enslave them by fire, their God will be able to bring fire upon us from above just as he brought it upon the Sodomites. He has, however, sworn never again to bring a flood into the world. &#x007B;By your life,&#x007D; come and let us enslave them through water. The Holy One said: I have sworn never again to bring a flood into the world. By your life, those people have gone into the flood. It is so stated (in Ps. 63:11 [10]): <small>THEY SHALL BE DRAGGED</small><sup><xref rid="fn322">78</xref></sup> <small>TO THE POWER OF THE DRYNESS</small><sup><xref rid="fn323">79</xref></sup> (of the sea bed). These people (i.e. these Egyptians) were dragged and went into the sea on their own. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY SHALL BE A PORTION FOR THE FOXES</small>. Solomon said (Cant. 2:15): <small>TAKE US &#x003C;TO&#x003E; THE FOXES</small> (<italic><small>ShW&#x2018;LYM</small></italic>)&#x2026;. R. Samuel has said: &#x007B;They saw <small>THE DEPTH OF THE SEA</small> (<italic><small>Sh&#x2018;L HYM</small></italic>).&#x007D; [<small>DEPTH OF SEA</small> (<italic><small>Sh&#x2018;L YM</small></italic>) is written &#x003C;here&#x003E;.]</p>
<p>The Holy One exacted punishment from them in Egypt and afterwards he exacted punishment from them at the sea. What is written concerning Egypt (in Exod. 12:29)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT &#x003C;THAT THE LORD SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN, FROM THE FIRST-BORN OF PHARAOH, WHO WAS SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, TO THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CAPTIVE WHO WAS IN THE DUNGEON, AND ALL THE FIRST-BORN OF THE CATTLE</small>&#x003E;. When he had killed their prince, he afterwards killed them; and so it says (in Exod. 12:12): <small>AND ON ALL THE GODS OF EGYPT &#x003C;I WILL EXECUTE JUDGMENTS</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. &#x003C;Gods &#x003E; of stone have rotted; &#x003C;those&#x003E; of silver and gold have been melted. When he had exacted punishment from their gods, he afterwards exacted punishment from them. (Exod. 15:1, cf. 21:) <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN INTO THE SEA</small>. This is the prince. And after that (in vs. 4): <small>PHARAOH&#x2019;S CHARIOTS AND HIS ARMY &#x003C;HE HAS CAST INTO THE SEA</small>&#x003E;. Also in the case of this evil Roman Empire, when the Holy One has exacted punishment from their prince, he will afterwards exact punishment from them, just as he did to the Babylonian Empire. When he had exacted punishment from their prince, he afterwards exacted punishment from Nebuchadnezzar. It is so stated (in Jer. 51:44): <small>I WILL ATTEND TO BEL</small> (the prince of Babylon) <small>IN BABYLON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn324">80</xref></sup> And so also he does to Edom (i.e., to Rome), as stated (in Jer. 46:15): <small>WHY HAS ABBIREKHA BEEN WASHED AWAY</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn325">81</xref></sup> This is their prince since he is afflicting that <italic>Abbirekha</italic> with leprosy.<sup><xref rid="fn326">82</xref></sup> Now <small>WASHED AWAY</small> (rt.: <small>SHP</small>) can only mean leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>&#x003C;WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003E; A SWELLING OR A SORE</small> (rt.: <small>SPH</small>) <small>&#x003C;OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Then afterwards he exacts punishment from it (i.e., the whole Kingdom of Edom, rt.: &#x2018;<small>DM</small>). It is so stated (in Jer. 46:15, cont.): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD THRUST IT DOWN</small>. And so it also says (in Is. 24:21): <small>THE LORD SHALL PUNISH THE HOST OF HEAVEN IN HEAVEN</small>; then afterwards (ibid.): <small>AND THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small>DM</small>) &#x007B;<small>IN</small>&#x007D; [<small>ON</small>] <small>THE EARTH</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small>DM</small>). But in the case of Israel, just as their God lives and abides forever and forevermore, so do they live and abide forever and forevermore. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 10:10): <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD: HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>; while concerning Israel it is written (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn274">30. The Masoretic text of Cant. 2:10 vowels <italic><small>R&#x2018;YTY</small></italic> as <italic>ra&#x2018;yati</italic> (<small>MY DARLING</small>). R. Johanan would revowel <italic><small>R&#x2018;YTY</small></italic> as <italic>re&#x2018;iyyati</italic> (<small>MY PASTURING</small>), a word which refers especially to the pasturing of sacrificial animals. Hence the reference to the sacrificial lambs of Exod. 29:39.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275">31. Cant. R. 2:11:1 connects this interpretation with the following and thereby suggests that like the winter, Israel&#x2019;s stay in Egypt was not unrelieved hardship.</ftnote>

Although this rare verb can mean &#x201C;enbalm&#x201D; (as in Gen. 50:2, 26), here the biblical context suggests a translation such as &#x201C;give form to,&#x201D; &#x201C;put forth,&#x201D; &#x201C;fill with juice,&#x201D; or &#x201C;ripen.&#x201D; The midrash, however, understands the word in a more negative sense such as &#x201C;overripen&#x201D; or &#x201C;shed.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 4 Exodus, Parashah IV: <italic>Beshallah</italic></title>
<title>4.1 Exodus 13:17ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 13:17:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Job 9:4): <small>ONE WISE OF HEART AND MIGHTY IN STRENGTH&#x2014;WHO HAS HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST HIM AND PROSPERED</small>? [<small>ONE WISE OF HEART</small>:] This is the Holy One, as stated (in Job 12:13): <small>WITH HIM ARE WISDOM AND</small> &#x007B;<small>UNDERSTANDING</small>&#x007D; [<small>VALOR</small>]. (Job 9:4, cont.:) <small>WHO HAS HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST HIM AND PROSPERED</small>? The generation of the flood hardened themselves against him; so he washed them away with water. The generation of the dispersion hardened themselves against him; &#x003C;so&#x003E; he dispersed them throughout the world. The people of Sodom hardened themselves against him, and what was their end? (Gen. 19:24:) <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &#x003C;&#x2026; BRIMSTONE AND FIRE.&#x003E;</small> (Exod. 5:2:) <small>PHARAOH SAID: WHO IS THE LORD</small>? For the Holy One had said to him (in vs. 1): <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>; but he also hardened himself, as stated (in Exod. 13:15): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HARDENED HIMSELF AGAINST LETTING</small> &#x007B;<small>THEM</small>&#x007D; [<small>US</small>] <small>GO</small>. As soon as the plague of the first-born came upon him, he immediately let them go. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C; THE PEOPLE &#x003E; GO</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.2 Exodus 13:17ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 13:17): [<small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>.] This text is related (to Ps. 66:3): <small>SAY TO GOD: HOW AWESOME ARE YOUR WORKS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn327">1</xref></sup> R. Eleazar the son of R. Jose the Galilean said: What is the meaning of <small>SAY TO GOD</small>? Say to your good worker (i.e., your creator): [Well done&#x0021;]</p>

R. Berekhyah and R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite differed. One said: <small>THEY DWINDLE AWAY</small> (<italic>yekhahashu</italic>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; they shall be broken, just as it is stated (in Deut. 33:29): <small>YOUR ENEMIES SHALL DWINDLE AWAY</small> (<italic>yekhahashu</italic>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>. But the other said: <small>THEY ARE DECEITFUL</small> (rt.: <small>KH<italic>Sh</italic></small>) <small>BEFORE YOU</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; your enemies shall lie and act deceitfully (rt.: <italic><small>KHSh</small></italic>). Nebuchadnezzar said (in Dan. 3:28): <small>BLESSED BE THE GOD OF SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABED-NEGO, &#x003C;WHO SENT HIS ANGEL TO DELIVER HIS SERVANTS THAT TRUSTED IN HIM AND FLOUTED THE KING&#x2019;S DECREE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 66:3): <small>&#x003C;YOUR ENEMIES&#x003E; SHALL BE DECEITFUL BEFORE YOU</small>. Sennacherib said (in II Kings 18:35): <small>WHO AMONG ALL THE GODS OF &#x003C;THOSE&#x003E; LANDS &#x003C;HAVE DELIVERED THEIR LAND FROM MY HAND&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;? He did not move from there until he had dwindled away, as stated (in II Chron. 32:21): <small>&#x003C;THEN THE LORD SENT AN ANGEL, WHO DESTROYED EVERY MIGHTY WARRIOR, COMMANDER, AND OFFICER IN THE CAMP OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA. &#x003E; SO HE RETURNED SHAME</small> [<small>FACED TO HIS OWN LAND</small>]. Pharaoh said (in Exod. 5:2): <small>I DO NOT KNOW THE LORD, &#x003C;AND MOREOVER I WILL NOT LET ISRAEL GO&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;That statement&#x003E; became a lie (<small>KH<italic>Sh</italic></small>) for them, when &#x003C;Pharaoh&#x003E; said (in Exod. 9:27): <small>THE LORD IS RIGHT, AND I AND MY PEOPLE ARE IN THE WRONG</small>. So he himself sent them away, as stated (in Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C; THE PEOPLE &#x003E; GO</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.3 Exodus 13:17ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 13:17): [<small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE&#x2019;S WAYS, HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn329">3</xref></sup> R. Joshua ben Levi said: About whom does it speak? About the evil drive, for is there &#x003C;any&#x003E; enemy of mine greater than this? It is customary that when one dwells in a city with a companion for one year, even if he hates him, he becomes his friend. The evil drive grows up with a person from his youth to his old age, and every day it wants to make him fall. So if it cannot make him fall within ten years, it makes him fall within twenty years. They said about Johanan the High Priest (i.e., John Hyrcanus) that he served in the High Priesthood for eighty years and in the end became a Sadducee.<sup><xref rid="fn330">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Berekhyah applies to &#x003C;the evil drive&#x003E; (Prov. 25:21): <small>IF YOUR ENEMY IS HUNGRY, GIVE HIM BREAD TO EAT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn331">5</xref></sup> This <small>&#x003C;ENEMY&#x003E;</small> is the evil drive. <small>GIVE HIM BREAD TO EAT</small> from the bread of Torah, just as it says (of wisdom in Prov. 9:5): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. (Prov. 25:21, cont.:) <small>AND IF HE IS THIRSTY, GIVE HIM WATER TO DRINK</small> from the waters of Torah, just as it says (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small>. For what reason? (Prov. 25:22:) <small>BECAUSE YOU WILL BE HEAPING BURNING COALS ON HIS HEAD</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE&#x2019;S WAYS</small>. This refers to the good drive. (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>. This refers to the evil drive. David said (in Ps. 35:10): <small>ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY: LORD, WHO IS LIKE YOU? YOU DELIVER THE POOR FROM ONE STRONGER THAN HE</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; the good drive from the evil drive.</p>
<p>R. Samuel bar Nahmani said (Prov. 16:7): <small>&#x003C;WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE&#x2019;S WAYS,&#x003E; HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE &#x003C;WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn332">6</xref></sup> This refers to the snake, of whom it is written (in Gen. 3:15): <small>AND I WILL PUT ENMITY &#x003C; BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN, &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Now when the Holy One is pleased with the ways of a person, he makes the one to be at peace with the other. There is a story about a certain snake who came hissing from the field. He entered someone&#x2019;s house on the Sabbath eve at nightfall, and saw a bowl of crushed garlic placed on the table. He put his mouth over it to eat the garlic. After he had eaten it, he vomited it into &#x003C;the bowl&#x003E;. Then he covered the bowl just as it had been at first. Another house snake saw it. What did he do? He went and uncovered the bowl. When they found it uncovered, they emptied it out. Who caused this householder not to die? The snake who uncovered &#x003C;the bowl&#x003E;. Ergo, (in Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH ONE&#x2019;S WAYS, &#x003C;HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 16:7): <small>WHEN THE LORD IS PLEASED &#x003C;WITH ONE&#x2019;S</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>WAYS&#x003E;</small>. This refers to Israel, about which it is written (in Deut. 27:14): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>EACH ONE</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;The verse from Proverbs refers to Israel, &#x003E; while they were in Egypt, when the time had come for the redemption. (Prov. 16:7, cont.): <small>HE MAKES EVEN HIS ENEMIES TO BE AT PEACE WITH HIM</small>. This refers to Pharaoh of whom it is written (in Exod. 15:9): <small>I WILL PURSUE, I WILL OVERTAKE, I WILL DIVIDE THE SPOIL</small>. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 13:17:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE &#x003E; GO</small>.</p>

I was intending to torment him a lot, but he has confessed immediately. &#x003C;Then, &#x003E; he gave him a dispensation.<sup><xref rid="fn335">9</xref></sup> So it was with Pharaoh when he enslaved Israel in Egypt. The plagues began to come upon him, but he did not let Israel go. Only after all the plagues had come upon him, did he begin to let them go. The Holy One said: Alas (<small>WY</small>), when he let them go.

The buyer went and made boxes, turret-shaped chests, and a lot of &#x003C;other&#x003E; things from them. When the one who sold the &#x003C; timbers &#x003E; saw these things, he began to &#x007B;be angry&#x007D; [lament] and said: Woe to that person&#x0021; What has he sold? So it was in the case of Pharaoh. When Israel was enslaved to him with clay and bricks, it was not known that they were a people. As soon as they had left Egypt, when they went and became troops by the sea, Pharaoh went out and saw that these very ones had become troops. At that time he began to cry out <small>ALAS</small> (<small>WY</small>).

He also had an <italic>ousia</italic> &#x007B;i.e., an orchard&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn341">15</xref></sup> Now he wanted to go away overseas, &#x003C;so&#x003E; he told a certain tenant to take care of it and eat of its fruit until his son became mature.<sup><xref rid="fn342">16</xref></sup> When the king&#x2019;s son grew up, he sought the <italic>ousia</italic>. The tenant immediately began to cry: <small>ALAS</small> (<small>WY</small>). Similarly, while Israel was in Egypt, the Canaanites dwelt in and took care of the land of Israel. They also ate of its fruits. As soon as they heard that Israel had left Egypt they began yelling: <small>ALAS</small> (<small>WY</small>). (Exod. 13:17:) <small>ALAS</small> (<small>WY</small>), <small>WOE</small> (<small>HY</small>), <small>WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>.</p>
<title>4.8 Exodus 13:17ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn343">17</xref></sup> Elsewhere it says (in Exod. 5:2): <small>AND MOREOVER I WILL NOT LET ISRAEL GO</small>; yet here he is letting them go. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who gave his servant some cash and said to him: Buy me one fish. So he went and bought him one stinking fish. The king said to him: By your life, you shall not leave without one of three &#x003C;punishments &#x003E;. You shall eat the fish, or you shall pay for it, or you shall be flogged with a hundred lashes. He said to him: I will eat it. He had not finished eating a little of it before it nauseated him. He said: I will be flogged with a hundred lashes. He &#x007B;was not used to eating&#x007D; [had not finished being flogged] with fifty [lashes] before he was in danger of dying. He said I will pay for it. It turned out that he ate a stinking fish, was flogged, and paid for it. So it was with Pharaoh. His enslavement of Israel in Egypt was excessive. The Holy One said to him (in Exod. 5:1: <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>. He said (in Exod. 5:2): <small>I DO NOT KNOW THE LORD</small>. He brought ten plagues<sup><xref rid="fn344">18</xref></sup> upon him, but he did not let them go. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you have to give them compensation. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 12:36): <small>AND THE LORD GAVE THE PEOPLE FAVOR &#x003C;IN THE EYES OF THE EGYPTIANS TO GIVE THEM LOANS. THUS THEY DESPOILED THE EGYPTIANS &#x003E;</small>. When they had received the plagues and given them compensation, after that he let them go. It is therefore stated (in Exod. 13:17): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS WHEN PHARAOH HAD LET &#x003C;THE PEOPLE&#x003E; GO</small>.</p>
<title>4.9 Exodus 13:17ff., Part IX</title>
<p>[(Exod. 13:17, cont.:) <small>THAT GOD DID NOT HAVE COMPASSION</small> (<small>NHM</small>).] &#x003C;One should read the verse in this way,&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn345">19</xref></sup> because the Holy One said to the Prophet (Ezek. 32:18): <small>SON OF ADAM, LAMENT OVER THE MASSES OF EGYPT</small>&#x2026;. Pharaoh began vaunting himself, and he said: Am I going down to them (in the grave)? He said to him (in Ezek. 32:19): <small>WHOM DO YOU SURPASS IN LOVELINESS</small>? Whom do you surpass in beauty? Are you better than the king of Assyria or the king of Tyre and Sidon? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>GO DOWN AND BE LAID WITH THE UNCIRCUMCISED</small>. (Vs. 22:) <small>THERE IS ASSYRIA WITH ALL ITS COMPANY</small>. (Vs. 24:) <small>THERE IS ELAM AND ALL ITS MASSES</small>. (Vs. 26:) <small>THERE ARE MESHECH AND TUBAL WITH ALL THEIR MASSES</small>. (Vs. 29:) <small>THERE IS EDOM WITH ITS KINGS AND ALL ITS PRINCES</small>. (Vs. 30:) <small>THERE ARE THE PRINCES OF THE NORTH</small>. When Pharaoh saw them, he was consoled (rt.: <small>NHM</small>), as stated (in vs. 31): [<small>THESE</small>] <small>SHALL PHARAOH SEE, AND HE SHALL BE CONSOLED</small> (<small>NHM</small>) [<small>OVER ALL THESE MASSES SLAIN BY THE SWORD, PHARAOH AND ALL HIS ARMY</small>.] The Holy One said to him: Pharaoh, you shall not be consoled because of what you did to my children.

<title>4.10 Exodus 13:17ff., Part X</title>
<p>[(Exod. 13:17, cont.:) <small>THAT GOD DID NOT LEAD THEM &#x003C;IN THE WAY OF THE EARTH</small> (<italic>derekh-erets</italic>)<small>&#x003E;</small>. He did not lead them according to the way of the whole earth.<sup><xref rid="fn346">20</xref></sup> In what manner &#x003C;did he lead them&#x003E;? According to custom the slave carries his master.<sup><xref rid="fn347">21</xref></sup> Would his lord carry him? The Holy One did not lead his people in such a way. Rather (according to Deut. 1:31) <small>AND IN THE WILDERNESS, WHERE YOU SAW HOW THE LORD YOUR GOD CARRIED YOU</small>&#x2026;. And it says (in Exod. 19:4): <small>I CARRIED YOU ON EAGLES</small>&#x2019; <small>WINGS</small>&#x2026;. According to custom (<italic>derekh-erets</italic>) the slave bathes his master, but in this case the Holy One washed us, as stated (in Ezek. 16:9): <small>AND I WASHED YOU WITH WATER</small>. According to custom the slave dresses his lord, but in this case the Holy One dressed them, as stated (in Ezek. 16:10): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERED GARMENTS</small>. According to custom the slave puts shoes on his master, but in this case (ibid., cont.): <small>I SHOD YOU WITH SEALSKIN</small>. According to custom the slave gives light to the master, but in this case the Holy One gave light to Israel, as stated (Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM &#x003C;BY DAY IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo, he did not lead them in the manner of the whole earth. And why all this? (Exod. 13:17:) <small>BECAUSE HE WAS NEAR</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn348">22</xref></sup> because they were near to the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 148:14): <small>HE HAS RAISED UP A HORN FOR HIS PEOPLE</small>, [<small>PRAISE FOR ALL HIS SAINTS</small>,] <small>EVEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, A PEOPLE NEAR TO HIM</small>.</p>
<title>4.11 Exodus 15:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 15:1:) <small>THEN SANG MOSES</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Cant. 4:8): [<small>COME</small>] <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON, MY BRIDE</small>, [<small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>]. It was only necessary to say &#x003C;a single&#x003E; &#x007B;<small>COME</small>&#x007D; <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>, [<small>MY BRIDE</small>]. What is the meaning of &#x003C;the second&#x003E; <small>COME WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>? Simply that in the world to come the Holy One will bring and assemble the dispersion of Israel. They shall go to Jerusalem, and the Divine Presence shall go forth for an <italic>apante</italic><sup><xref rid="fn349">23</xref></sup> with them &#x007B;i.e., to their region&#x007D;. Thus it is stated (in Cant. 4:8): <small>COME WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 4:8): <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small> (rt.: <small>LBN</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn350">24</xref></sup> R. Levi said: The Holy One said: I was with you during the Egyptian enslavement. R. Berekhyah the Priest said: R.

In a place where a road of brickwork (rt.: <small>LBN</small>) was to be laid, it was laid.<sup><xref rid="fn351">25</xref></sup> The enslavement in Babylon was greater than the enslavement in Egypt. Of Egypt it is written (ibid.) <small>AND UNDER HIS FEET THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE BRICKWORK</small> (rt.: <small>LBN</small>) <small>OF SAPPHIRE</small>; but of Babylon it is written (in Ezek. 1:26): <small>IN APPEARANCE LIKE</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; <small>STONEWORK OF SAPPHIRE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn352">26</xref></sup> Of Egypt it is written (in Exod. 1:14): <small>AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER WITH HARD LABOR</small>; but of Babylon it is written (in Is. 14:3): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE DAY THAT THE LORD GIVES &#x003C;YOU&#x003E; REST &#x003C;FROM YOUR SORROW, FROM YOUR TROUBLE, &#x003E; AND FROM YOUR HARD LABOR</small>. The Holy One said to them: In Babylon I was with you, and in Egypt I was with you.

<p>(Cant. 4:8, cont.:) <small>SING</small><sup><xref rid="fn354">28</xref></sup> <small>FROM THE TOP OF AMANA</small>. R. Jose ben Shunem said: It is a mountain named Amana, and when the diaspora arrives at this mountain they will utter a song.<sup><xref rid="fn355">29</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>SING FROM THE TOP OF AMANA</small>, through the merit of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn356">30</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FROM THE TOP OF SENIR</small>, through the merit of Isaac. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HERMON</small>, through the merit of Jacob.</p>
<p>Another interpretation [(of Cant. 4:8, cont.): <small>SING FROM THE TOP OF AMANA</small>.] By what merit did Israel merit uttering a song over the sea? By the merit of the faith with which they believed. What is written above of the matter (in Exod. 14:31)? <small>WHEN ISRAEL SAW THE MIGHTY POWER &#x003C;WHICH THE LORD HAD EXERCISED AGAINST THE EGYPTIANS &#x003E;</small>,&#x2026; [<small>THEY BELIEVED IN THE LORD AND IN HIS SERVANT MOSES</small>.] R. Nehemiah said: By what merit did they utter a song? By the merit of the faith with which they believed at the beginning, as stated (in Exod. 4:31): <small>AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED</small>. (Cant. 4:8:) <small>SING FROM THE TOP OF AMANA</small>. By the merit of faith they were worthy of uttering a song, as stated (in Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN SANG MOSES</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.12 Exodus 15:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>SANG MOSES</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Ps. 40:2 [1]): <small>I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. R. Pinhas ben Hama the Priest said: If you waited patiently and he did not come, continue to wait. David said (in Ps. 27:14): <small>WAIT FOR THE LORD</small>; [<small>BE STRONG AND LET YOUR HEART TAKE COURAGE&#x0021; O WAIT FOR THE LORD</small>]. If he came, your expectation was right. If not, continue to <small>WAIT FOR THE LORD</small>. David said (in Ps. 40:2 [1]): <small>I WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE LORD</small>. Because of the waiting, (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE INCLINED TOWARD ME AND HEARD MY CRY</small>. (Exod. 2:24:) <small>AND GOD HEARD THEIR MOANING</small>&#x2026;. (Ps. 40:3 [2]:) <small>AND HE RAISED ME UP FROM THE PIT OF DESOLATION, FROM THE MIRY CLAY</small>&#x2026;, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; from the clay of bricks. (Ibid.:) <small>AND HE SET MY FEET UPON A ROCK</small>, in that he gave me the booty of Egypt and the booty of the sea. &#x007B;(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE ESTABLISHED MY STEPS</small>.&#x007D; (Ps. 40:4 [3]:) <small>AND HE HAS PUT A NEW SONG IN MY MOUTH</small>. (Exod. 15:1) <small>THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>SANG MOSES</small>. What is the meaning of (<italic>az</italic>)? With an <italic>az</italic> the Holy One made the dry land into sea for the generation of Enosh. It is so stated (in Gen. 4:26): <small>THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>THERE WAS PROFANATION IN CALLING &#x003C;OTHER GODS&#x003E; BY THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn357">31</xref></sup> But for us he made the sea into dry land. With <italic>az</italic> we praised him.<sup><xref rid="fn358">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:1): Why with <italic>az</italic>? Moses said: With an <italic>az</italic> I complained to the Holy One, as stated (in Exod. 5:23): <small>FOR EVER SINCE</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>I CAME &#x003C;TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME, HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. With the word by which I sinned, with that very word <italic>az</italic> I am making amends by praising you (in Exod. 15:1).</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>az</italic> (spelled with the two Hebrew letters <italic>alef</italic> and <italic>zayin</italic>)<italic>. Alef</italic> is one and <italic>zayin</italic> is seven for a total of eight. Moses said: By the merit of circumcision, which was ordained for &#x003C;day&#x003E; eight (Lev. 12:3), the sea was rent asunder. So let us praise him with an <italic>az</italic>. R. Levi cited (Ps. 136:13): <small>TO HIM WHO RENT THE REED SEA IN PIECES</small> (<italic>gezarim</italic>), because in the Aramaic language they call those who are circumcised clipped (<italic>gezurim</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn359">33</xref></sup> By the merit of circumcision (<italic>milah</italic>) the sea was rent asunder.</p>
<title>4.13 Exodus 15:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN SHALL MOSES &#x003C;AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E; SING</small>.] &#x201C;Then sang Moses,&#x201D; is not &#x003C;actually&#x003E; stated here, but <small>THEN SHALL</small> [<small>MOSES</small>] <small>SING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn360">34</xref></sup> In the world to come Israel is going to utter a song to the <small>LORD</small>. &#x007B;The song is suitable&#x007D; [He is suitable for the song], and the song is suitable for the <small>LORD</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 15:1, cont.:) <small>AND THEY SPOKE, SAYING</small>: What is the meaning of <small>SAYING? SAYING</small>: The miracles which the Holy One has done with Israel belong to &#x003C;all&#x003E; generations.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:1): <small>THEN SANG</small>. When Israel was camping by the sea, the ministering angels came to praise the Holy One, but the Holy One did not give them permission, as stated (in Exod. 14:20): <small>AND THE ONE DID NOT COME NEAR THE OTHER</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn361">35</xref></sup> It also says (in Is. 6:3): <small>AND ONE CRIED UNTO THE OTHER</small>. To whom are they comparable? To a king whose son was taken prisoner.<sup><xref rid="fn362">36</xref></sup> He clothed himself in vindictiveness against his enemies. When he went to bring him &#x003C;back&#x003E;, the people came to utter a hymn<sup><xref rid="fn363">37</xref></sup> for him. He said to them: When I have redeemed my son, &#x003C;then&#x003E; you will praise me. Similarly Israel was put in distress by the sea. The ministering angels came to praise him. He rebuked them. The Holy One said to them: When my children are put in distress, would you offer me praise? When they came up from the sea, Israel and the ministering angels wanted to utter a song. R. Abbin the Levite said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who went down to battle and won. His son and his servant came to him, and in their hands was a crown to put on the king&#x2019;s head. They came to the king and said to him: Your son and your servant are standing by with a crown in their hands. Who will enter first? He said to them: &#x003C;You are&#x003E; the world&#x2019;s greatest fools&#x0021; Shall my servant precede my son? Let my son enter first. Similarly, when Israel came up from the sea, Israel and the ministering angels came to utter a song. The Holy One said to the ministering angels: Let Israel be first. (Exod. 15:1:) <small>THEN SANG MOSES</small> [<small>AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>]. The women and the ministering angels were found to be standing by. Who would offer praise first? R. Hiyya bar Abba bar Shallum said: He made peace between them, as stated (in Ps. 68:26 [25]): <small>SINGERS COME FIRST; THEN FOLLOW MUSICIANS IN THE MIDST OF TIMBREL-PLAYING MAIDENS</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>THE SINGERS COME FIRST</small> &#x007B;<small>THEN FOLLOW MUSICIANS</small>&#x007D;. These are Israel. &#x007B;<small>AND AFTERWARDS</small>&#x007D; [<small>THEN FOLLOW</small>] <small>MUSICIANS</small>. These are the angels. &#x007B;And afterwards&#x007D; <small>IN THE MIDST OF TIMBREL-PLAYING MAIDENS</small>. [These are the women.] R. Levi said: By the heavens, I do not accept this interpretation. Rather the women first offered praise, simply because &#x003C;it says:&#x003E; <small>THEN FOLLOW THE MUSICIANS</small>. These are Israel. <small>IN THE MIDST OF TIMBREL-PLAYING MAIDENS</small>. These are the women. The ministering angels began to complain to the Holy One. They said: Is it not enough for the men to precede us? But are the women to do so as well? The Holy One said to them: As you live, yes. R. Helbo said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahman: See what is written (in Ezek. 3:12): <small>THEN THE SPIRIT RAISED ME UP, AND AFTER ME</small><sup><xref rid="fn364">38</xref></sup> <small>I HEARD A &#x003C;GREAT ROARING&#x003E; SOUND</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AFTER ME</small> (&#x2019;<italic><small>HRY</small></italic>)? After (&#x2019;<italic><small>HRY</small></italic>) I and my friends have offered praise.<sup><xref rid="fn365">39</xref></sup> Then afterwards the ministering angels went and said (ibid., cont.): <small>BLESSED IS THE GLORY OF THE LORD FROM HIS PLACE</small>. R. Pinhas ben Hama the Priest said: What is written (in Ezek. 1:24)? <small>WHEN THEY STOOD, THEY WOULD LET THEIR WINGS DROOP</small>. What is the meaning of [<small>WHEN THEY STOOD</small>]? Whoever hears <small>WHEN THEY STOOD</small> is thinking: Perhaps there is sitting above. [Heaven forbid. There is no sitting above.]<sup><xref rid="fn366">40</xref></sup> Rather they all stand, as stated (in Is. 6:2): <small>THE SERAPHIM STOOD</small>&#x2026;. And so it says (in Dan. 7:16): <small>I DREW NEAR TO ONE OF THOSE STANDING THERE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHEN THEY STOOD</small>? Simply that when Israel stands and praises the Holy One, at that time <small>THEY LET THEIR WINGS DROOP</small>.</p>
<title>4.14 Exodus 15:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 15:1, cont.:) <small>I WILL SING TO THE LORD FOR HE IS EXALTEDLY &#x003C; EXALTED</small> &#x003E;. R. Abbin the Levite said: There are four exalted beings in the world. The most exalted among wild beasts is the lion, the most exalted among cattle is the ox, the most exalted among birds is the eagle, and the most exalted of them all is the human.<sup><xref rid="fn367">41</xref></sup> The Holy One took and installed them in the glorious throne so that he was exalted over the exalted ones. Ergo (in Exod. 15:1): <small>I WILL SING TO THE LORD FOR HE IS EXALTEDLY EXALTED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn368">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 15:1, cont.:) <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</small>. Was there &#x003C;only&#x003E; one horse, in view of what is written: <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</small>? It is simply that, they were not all counted &#x003C; individually &#x003E; before the Holy One but &#x003C;were counted &#x003E; as a single &#x003C;unit&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn369">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:1) <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER</small> (<small>RKB</small>). [Bar Qappara said:] The Holy One bound them to one another.<sup><xref rid="fn370">44</xref></sup> Why? So that Israel would benefit in the booty. Why? When Israel left Egypt, the Egyptians went after them. Pharaoh said to them: I know that they took your silver and gold, but pay no attention to booty. What did he do? He opened the treasury<sup><xref rid="fn371">45</xref></sup> of Joseph. He said: Take silver and gold for yourselves. So they took &#x003C;it&#x003E; and adorned their horses. Thus it is stated (in the singular in Exod. 14:9): <small>ALL THE HORSE OF PHARAOH&#x2019;S CHARIOT</small> (<small>RKB</small>). Therefore they were tied to one another so that Israel would benefit in the booty. In this world Israel has benefited in the plunder of her enemies, but in the world to come whatever the nations acquire will belong to Israel. It is so stated (of Tyre, which collects harlotry fees from all the kingdoms of the earth, in Is. 23:18): <small>HER PROFITS AND HER HARLOT&#x2019;S HIRE SHALL BE DEDICATED TO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>4.15 Exodus 15:22., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 15:22:) <small>THEN MOSES HAD ISRAEL JOURNEY &#x003C;FROM THE REED SEA&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>. Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, just as the sheep are scattered and the shepherd gathers them, so in the wilderness Israelites were always fighting among themselves, weeping, and complaining, as stated (in Ps. 78:40): <small>HOW OFTEN DID THEY DEFY HIM IN THE WILDERNESS</small>&#x0021; The Holy One, as it were, did not depart from them but led them like sheep. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, just as the sheep destroy the trees, and yet their master is not upset with them, &#x003C;so it is with Israel&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn372">46</xref></sup> Therefore he calls them sheep. And so it says (in Ezek. 34:31): <small>FOR YOU MY FLOCK, THE FLOCK OF MY PASTURE, YOU ARE HUMANS</small>. If sheep, why humans; and if humans, why sheep?<sup><xref rid="fn373">47</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: They are sheep when it comes to punishments and humans when it comes to giving a reward. [If they are guilty, he treats them like sheep in order to punish them; but if they perform the commandments he treats them like humans in order to give them a reward. Ergo, sheep for punishments, and humans for giving a reward.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): <small>BUT HE HAD HIS PEOPLE JOURNEY LIKE SHEEP</small>. R. Berekhyah said: See how beloved Israel was before the Holy One, when he called them a lamb&#x0021; It is so stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED LAMB</small>. Whoever has a single lamb feeds it and waters it on time because it is &#x003C;only&#x003E; one. However, whoever has a lot of sheep is not able to care for them. He merely expends a lot of toil with them. See the love with which the Holy One loved Israel when he called them sheep and says (in Ezek. 36:37): <small>I WILL MULTIPLY THEM LIKE SHEEP</small>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn374">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:52): Why <small>LIKE SHEEP</small>? Because, [just] as a shepherd looks out for his sheep during the day because of the heat and during the night because of the wolves, so the Holy One looks out for Israel. Thus it is stated (in Is. 4:6): <small>THERE SHALL BE A SUKKAH AS A SHADE &#x003C; FROM THE HEAT&#x003E; BY DAY</small>&#x2026;. And it says (in Exod. 13:22): <small>THE PILLAR OF CLOUD DID NOT DEPART BY DAY</small>&#x2026;. It also says (in Ps. 77:21 [20]): <small>YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE SHEEP</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>YOU LED</small> (<small>NHYT</small>)? <small>NHYT</small> is simply an acronym.<sup><xref rid="fn375">49</xref></sup> &#x003C;N:&#x003E; Awesome things (<italic>nora&#x2019;ot</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you showed us in Egypt. &#x003C;H:&#x003E; Your wrath (<italic>haronekha</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you poured out upon them. &#x003C;Y:&#x003E; Your right hand (<italic>yeminekha</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; devoured them. &#x003C;T:&#x003E; The deep (<italic>tehom</italic>) &#x003C;with which&#x003E; you covered them. R. Joshua says: &#x003C;N: &#x003E; Wonders (<italic>nifla&#x2019;ot</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you performed for us. &#x003C;H:&#x003E; Freedom (<italic>herut</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you gave us. &#x003C;Y:&#x003E; A sea (<italic>yam</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you parted for us. &#x003C;T:&#x003E; Torah &#x003C;which&#x003E; you gave us. R. Eleazar of Modim said: &#x003C;N:&#x003E; Miracles (<italic>nissim</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you have performed for us. &#x003C;H:&#x003E; Life (<italic>hayyim</italic>) &#x003C; which &#x003E; you have &#x007B;performed for&#x007D; [given] us. &#x003C;Y:&#x003E; Your hand (<italic>yadekha</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you have shown us. &#x003C;T:&#x003E; Holding the head high (<italic>tilluy rosh</italic>), &#x003C;a right which&#x003E; you have given us. But the sages say: &#x003C;N:&#x003E; Prophets (<italic>nevi&#x2019;im</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you have raised up from among us. &#x003C;H:&#x003E; Saints (<italic>hasidim</italic>) &#x003C;which&#x003E; you have raised up from among us. &#x003C;Y:&#x003E; Upright (<italic>yesharim</italic>), &#x003C;T:&#x003E; Unblemished ones (<italic>temimim</italic>) &#x003C;whom&#x003E; you have raised up from among us. Now all these were through the merit of Moses. Ergo (in Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY &#x003C;FROM THE REED SEA &#x2026;&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>4.16 Exodus 15:22ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation [(of Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E;</small><small>JOURNEY &#x003C;FROM THE REED SEA &#x2026;&#x003E;</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY</small>? That he had them journey under duress when they were unwilling. How? It is simply that when Israel left Egypt, Pharaoh left in pursuit of them with all those troops,<sup><xref rid="fn376">50</xref></sup> as stated (in Exod. 14:7): <small>THEN HE TOOK SIX HUNDRED SELECT CHARIOTS</small>. What did he do? He arose and adorned all those horses with precious stones and pearls.<sup><xref rid="fn377">51</xref></sup> When they came to the sea, the Holy One drowned them. Then all those precious stones and pearls floated up on the seashore where they were thrown. Then Israel went down every day to take some. So they did not want to move from there. When Moses saw that, he said to them: What are you thinking? That on every day the sea will bring up precious stones and pearls for you? He arose and had them travel under duress.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY &#x003C;FROM THE REED SEA</small>&#x2026;&#x003E;. R. Joshua said: Which journey did Israel make that was not by divine command?<sup><xref rid="fn378">52</xref></sup> This is the one of which it is stated (in Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY</small>.</p>
<p>R. Eleazar of Modim says: They did journey by divine command, as we find to be so &#x007B;in one place &#x003C;or&#x003E; two or three&#x007D; [elsewhere in two or three places] (e.g., in Numb. 9:18, 20, 23): <small>AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD THEY</small> (i.e., the children of Israel) <small>JOURNEYED</small>. So also here (in Exod. 15:22), although he has written <small>THEN</small> [<small>MOSES</small>] <small>HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY</small>, they journeyed by divine command. Then what is the meaning of (Exod 15:22:) <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C;ISRAEL&#x003E; JOURNEY</small>? When he told them to journey, they did not say to him: Where are we journeying? Into the desert? Perhaps there is nothing there. Rather they arose and journeyed in trustfulness. Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 2:2): <small>GO AND PROCLAIM IN THE EARS OF JERUSALEM</small>, [<small>SAYING: THUS SAYS THE LORD: I HAVE REMEMBERED IN YOUR FAVOR THE FAITHFULNESS OF YOUR YOUTH</small>&#x2026;, <small>HOW YOU WENT AFTER ME IN THE DESERT, IN A LAND NOT SOWN</small>].</p>
<title>4.17 Exodus 15:22ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:22): <small>THEN MOSES HAD &#x003C; ISRAEL &#x003E; JOURNEY FROM THE REED SEA, AND THEY WENT OUT INTO THE WILDERNESS OF SHUR</small>. Our masters have said: The desert of Shur was eight hundred by eight hundred parasangs; and it was full of serpents, scorpions, and evil beasts.<sup><xref rid="fn379">53</xref></sup> R. Jose said: There were serpents there like the beams of an oil press and scorpions about the size of a span. So it says (in Deut. 8:15): (<small>GOD</small>) <small>WHO LED YOU THROUGH THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE WILDERNESS WITH ITS FIERY</small> (<italic>saraf</italic>) <small>SERPENTS AND SCORPIONS</small>&#x2026;. There is a story about King Shabor,<sup><xref rid="fn380">54</xref></sup> who was passing by there. The first caravan<sup><xref rid="fn381">55</xref></sup> passed by, and the serpent devoured it. A second passed by, and it devoured that one. A third passed by, and it devoured that one. The king sat down troubled. With him there were &#x003C;the&#x003E; scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn382">56</xref></sup> They said to him: Why are you stopping? Get ten warriors. So he got them. They said to him: Let them fill <italic>serodot</italic> &#x007B;i.e., sacks&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn383">57</xref></sup> with straw. So they filled <italic>serodot</italic> with straw and they rolled them in front of it (the serpent). Then it gormandized until its belly expanded and it was unable to move. So they arose and killed it. Ergo (in Deut. 8:15): (<small>GOD</small>) <small>WHO LED YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>It also says (in Is. 30:6): <small>VIPER AND FLYING SERPENT</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FLYING SERPENT</small> (<italic>saraf</italic>, rt.: <small>SRP</small>)?<sup><xref rid="fn384">58</xref></sup> Whatever the bird flew over was immediately burned (rt.: <small>SRP</small>). R. Hiyya the Great said: There was a certain person in the land of Israel named Merutah.<sup><xref rid="fn385">59</xref></sup> Why was his name called Merutah? They said: One time he went up to gather wood from the mountains and saw the serpent asleep, but the serpent did not see him. Then his hair fell out from fear. So they called him Merutah, and no hair grew on him until the day of his death. Ergo (in Deut. 8:10): <small>WHO LED YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>R. Jose b. R. Hanina said: Great is our God, who saved us from that desert.</p>
<title>4.18 Exodus 15:22ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Exod. 15:22, cont.:) <small>THEY WENT THREE DAYS IN THE WILDERNESS AND FOUND NO WATER</small>.] R. Joshua says: When Israel crossed through the sea, fresh water came forth for them. So they partook of it in their vessels and drank; but as soon as the water was finished, they complained, as stated (in Exod. 15:24): <small>AND THE PEOPLE MURMURED AGAINST MOSES, &#x003C; SAYING: WHAT SHALL WE DRINK?&#x003E; WHEN</small> (in vs. 23) <small>THEY CAME TO MARAH, &#x003C;THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF MARAH BECAUSE IT WAS BITTER</small> (<italic>Marim</italic>). <small>FOR THAT REASON ITS NAME WAS CALLED MARAH.&#x003E;</small> They should have consulted with the greatest one among them; but they arose and complained.<sup><xref rid="fn386">60</xref></sup> R. Eleazar of Modim says: Israel was accustomed to speaking words of complaint against the Holy One. Immediately (in Exod. 15:25:) <small>&#x003C;MOSES&#x003E; CRIED UNTO THE LORD, AND THE LORD TAUGHT</small> (<italic>wayyorehu</italic>) <small>HIM A TREE</small>. &#x201C;Showed him (<italic>wayyar&#x2019;ehu</italic>)&#x201D; is not stated &#x003C;here&#x003E;, but <small>TAUGHT HIM</small> (<italic>wayyorehu</italic>). R. Simeon ben Johay said: He taught him [something] from the Torah, concerning which it is written (in Prov. 3:18) <small>IT IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. The Holy One taught him (the living tree of Torah). Then he spoke over the water and it became fresh.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 15:25): <small>AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM A TREE</small>. What was it?<sup><xref rid="fn387">61</xref></sup> R. Joshua says: It was an olive tree; R. Nehemiah says: A willow tree. Some say: The roots of a fig tree; and others say: The roots of a pomegranate, since there is nothing as bitter as those. But the sages say: It was ivy<sup><xref rid="fn388">62</xref></sup> wood, and there is nothing as bitter as that. R. Ishmael the son of R. Johanan ben Baroqah said: See how great are the miracles of the Holy One&#x0021; &#x003C;Those of&#x003E; flesh and blood cure the bitter with the sweet, but the Holy One cures the bitter with the bitter.<sup><xref rid="fn389">63</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Jer. 30:17): [<small>FOR I WILL RESTORE HEALTH TO YOU</small>]: <small>AND I WILL HEAL YOU OF YOUR WOUNDS, SAYS THE LORD</small>. By whatever means he wounds he heals. The Holy One told Moses to put something sour into something sour for it to become sweet thereby. Similarly it is written (in II Kings 2:21): <small>SO &#x003C;ELISHA&#x003E; WENT OUT TO THE SPRING OF WATER, THREW SALT IN IT</small>,&#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn390">64</xref></sup> <small>AND SAID: THUS SAYS THE LORD: I HAVE HEALED &#x003C;THIS&#x003E; WATER</small>. Similarly (in Is. 38:21): <small>AND ISAIAH SAID: LET THEM TAKE A CAKE OF FIGS &#x003C;AND APPLY IT TO THE BOIL, AND HE WILL LIVE&#x003E;</small>. Is it not a fact that, when one puts fig juice on the flesh, it is immediately consumed? &#x003C;This exception,&#x003E; however, &#x003C;was&#x003E; in order to perform a miracle.</p>
<title>4.19 Exodus 15:22ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 15:25, cont.:) <small>THERE HE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE. A STATUTE</small> (as in Exod. 20:12): The honoring of father and mother.<sup><xref rid="fn391">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 15:26:) <small>HE ALSO SAID: IF YOU DILIGENTLY HEED</small>. &#x003C;When&#x003E; someone has been willing to heed one commandment, he heeds many. &#x007B;R. Eleazar&#x007D; [R. Simeon ben Eleazar] says: Anyone who wants to heed, that one is made to heed.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. From here you learn: Everyone who learns from the mouth of a learned sage is like one who hears from the mouth of the Almighty.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>DO WHAT IS UPRIGHT IN HIS EYES</small>, i.e., &#x003C;conduct&#x003E; business in peace.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>GIVE EAR TO HIS COMMANDMENTS</small>, i.e., the laws (<italic>halakhot</italic>).</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HEED ALL HIS STATUTES</small>, i.e., his decrees.</p>
<p>(Ibid., end:) &#x003C;&#x2026;,&#x003E; <small>FOR I AM THE LORD YOUR PHYSICIAN</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: &#x003C;The words of&#x003E; Torah that I have given you are healing you, as stated (in Prov. 3:8): <small>IT SHALL BE HEALING TO YOUR NAVEL</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.20 Exodus 16:4ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 16:4:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. This text is related (to Job 36:31): <small>FOR THROUGH THESE THINGS HE JUDGES PEOPLES</small>. These things are the heavens; through them he judges the peoples of the world. You yourself know that, when the generation of the flood sinned, he judged them through those &#x003C; heavens &#x003E;, as stated (in Ps. 11:6): <small>HE WILL RAIN DOWN SNARES UPON THE WICKED</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Job 36:31): <small>FOR THROUGH THESE THINGS HE JUDGES PEOPLES</small>&#x2026;. When the people of Sodom sinned, he judged them through the heavens, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn392">66</xref></sup> Also when Sisera sinned, he judged him through the heavens, as stated (in Jud. 5:20): <small>&#x003C;THE STARS &#x003E; FOUGHT FROM THE HEAVENS</small> &#x2026;. Through the heavens he judges the peoples. (Job 36:31, cont.:) <small>HE GIVES FOOD IN ABUNDANCE</small>. From those &#x003C; heavens &#x003E; we know that he gave nourishment to Israel. To what is the matter comparable? To a baker who was standing at the oven.<sup><xref rid="fn393">67</xref></sup> When his enemy entered, he raked up burning coals, and put them on his head. When his friend entered, he took out &#x003C;some&#x003E; hot bread. Thus &#x003C;the oven&#x003E; gave him the burning coals and the bread. Both of them came out of the oven. So the Holy One brought down fire upon the Sodomites and burned them up, but for Israel he brought down manna from heaven, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN &#x003C;BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS &#x003E; FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: It should not have said: <small>FROM THE HEAVENS</small>, but &#x201C;From the earth,&#x201D; because their bread customarily comes up only from the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn394">68</xref></sup> But this text is related (to Ps. 135:6): <small>WHATEVER THE LORD DESIRES HE DOES</small>&#x2026;. When he wished &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;, he divided the sea before Israel and made it dry land; and when he wished &#x003C;to do so&#x003E; he made it a sea. The custom of heaven is to bring down dew and rain and for the earth to bring forth bread, as stated (in Job 28:5): <small>AS FOR THE EARTH, OUT OF IT COMES FORTH BREAD</small>. But when he wished &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;, he brought down the bread from the heavens, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD &#x003C; FROM THE HEAVENS&#x003E; FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;. And the dew goes up from the earth, as stated (in Exod. 16:14): <small>WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP</small>. This text is related (to II Chron. 12:8): <small>NEVERTHELESS, THEY SHALL BE</small> &#x007B;<small>MY</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIS</small>] <small>SERVANTS</small>&#x2026;. But they were not servants to Nebuchadnezzar, as stated (in Dan. 1:6): <small>NOW AMONG THOSE FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH WERE DANIEL, &#x003C; HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. What did he do for them? (Vs. 5): <small>THE KING APPOINTED FOR THEM</small> [<small>A DAILY PORTION</small>]&#x2026;. But when you brought down manna for them, it came down just as the rain comes down, for there was no limit to it. Thus (according to Exod. 16:4) I rained <small>DOWN</small> [<small>BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>].</p>
<title>4.21 Exodus 16:4ff., Part II</title>
<p>Zavday ben Levi said: Two thousand cubits (of manna) came down each day<sup><xref rid="fn395">69</xref></sup> and remained four hours. As soon as the sun rose over it, it melted and became countless torrents as it flooded and ran down. For whom is it destined now? For the righteous in the age to come. Whoever believes has the right to eat of it, but whoever does not believe, (according to Job 20:17): <small>MAY NOT LOOK UPON THE STREAMS, &#x003C;THE TORRENTIAL RIVERS OF HONEY AND CREAM&#x003E;</small>. As soon as it ran down in rivers, the peoples of the world came to drink from it; but it became wormwood and gall in their mouths, as stated (in Numb. 11:7): <small>NOW THE MANNA WAS LIKE BITTER</small> (<italic>gad</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn396">70</xref></sup> <small>SEED</small>&#x2026;. For Israel, however, &#x003C;the manna &#x003E; became honey within their mouths, just as it says: (in Exod. 16:31): <small>&#x003C;AND ITS TASTE WAS&#x003E; LIKE WAFERS IN HONEY</small>. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: There is a calculation that &#x003C; enough &#x003E; manna came down to Israel [on every day] &#x003C;to provide &#x003E; food for two thousand years, and it was sixty cubits deep.<sup><xref rid="fn397">71</xref></sup> It is written concerning the flood (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY ALL THE SPRINGS &#x003C;OF THE GREAT ABYSS &#x003E; BURST FORTH &#x003C;AND THE WINDOWS OF THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED&#x003E;</small>. It is also written concerning the manna (in Ps. 78:23): <small>SO HE COMMANDED THE SKIES ABOVE, AND HE OPENED THE DOORS OF HEAVEN</small>. The doors equal four windows. It is also written (concerning the Holy One in Exod. 34:7): <small>PRESERVING STEADFAST LOVE &#x003C;FOR THOUSANDS&#x003E;</small>. And it is written (ibid.): <small>VISITING THE INIQUITY OF PARENTS &#x003C;UPON CHILDREN AND UPON CHILDREN&#x2019;S CHILDREN &#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. From here it is shown that a good measure is five hundred times greater than a measure of divine punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn398">72</xref></sup> When two windows were opened during the flood, all those rains came down for twelve months. Now it is written here (concerning the manna in Ps. 78:23): <small>AND HE OPENED THE DOORS OF HEAVEN</small>. From here it is shown that &#x003C; enough &#x003E; manna came down on every day &#x003C;to provide &#x003E; food for two thousand years.<sup><xref rid="fn399">73</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.22 Exodus 16:4ff., Part III</title>
<p>The peoples of the world were not able to taste it because in their mouths it became like bitter wormwood. What did they do? They caught a deer that had drunk of it, and they took from it a taste of manna. Then they said: Blessed be the &#x007B;body&#x007D; [nation] which has this. R. Jose bar Hanina said: The babies who tasted it were not like the old person who tasted it.<sup><xref rid="fn400">74</xref></sup> How? To the babies it had the taste of milk, as stated (in Numb. 11:8): <small>AND IT TASTED LIKE RICH CREAM</small>. To the youths it tasted like honey, as stated (in Exod. 16:31): <small>AND ITS TASTE WAS LIKE WAFERS IN HONEY</small>. To the old people it tasted like bread, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. To the sick it tasted like fine flour mixed with oil and honey, like barley grits,<sup><xref rid="fn401">75</xref></sup> which they make for one who is sick. It is so stated (in Numb. 11:8): <small>THEY BOILED IT IN A POT</small>. And where is it shown that it had the taste of fine flour and honey? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 16:19): <small>ALSO MY BREAD, WHICH I GAVE YOU, FINE FLOUR, OIL, AND HONEY</small>&#x2026;. Each and everyone tasted it according to his physical ability. Whoever was active went out and gathered it from the field, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL GO OUT TO GATHER</small>. Those who were fairly &#x003C;active&#x003E; went out to their tent doors [to gather]. But the lazy lay down, stretched out their hands, and it came down right into their hands. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 16:14): <small>WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP, &#x003C;THERE ON THE FACE OF THE DESERT LAY SOMETHING FINE AND FLAKY&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small></p>
<p>(Exod. 16:14:) [<small>FINE AND FLAKY</small>]. Bar Qappara said: What is the meaning of <small>FLAKY</small> (<small>MHSPS</small>)? Bread which was kept in 248 human members according to the numerical value of <small>MHSPS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn402">76</xref></sup> <italic>M</italic> is forty, <italic>H</italic> is eight, <italic>S</italic> is sixty, <italic>P</italic> is eighty, &#x003C;and&#x003E; <italic>S</italic> is sixty, for a total of 248, which corresponds to the 248 members in a human being. It is so stated (in Ps. 78:25): <small>EACH ONE ATE THE BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small>. Do not read: <small>BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>BYRYM</small></italic>) but: <small>BREAD OF HUMAN MEMBERS</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>BRYM</small></italic>). The ministering angels ground up the manna. Then it came down to Israel, and they ate it. Not one of them had to preserve it because it was kept in &#x003C;one&#x2019;s&#x003E; members. Ergo (in Ps. 78:25): <small>BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small> means <small>BREAD OF HUMAN MEMBERS</small>.</p>
<title>4.23 Exodus 16:4ff., Part IV</title>
<p>R. Hama b. R. Hanina said: When the manna was given to Israel, it was given to them in Alush. And why in Alush? For the sake of our mother Sarah, of whom it is written (in Gen. 18:6): <small>KNEAD</small> (<italic>lushi</italic>) <small>IT AND MAKE CAKES</small>. Therefore, &#x003C;the manna &#x003E; was given to them in Alush.</p>
<p>(Exod. 16:4:) <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD &#x003C;FROM THE HEAVENS&#x003E; FOR YOU</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to them: See what the difference is between me and you. You offer me one omer for the whole year, as stated (in Lev. 23:10): <small>YOU SHALL BRING &#x003C;THE FIRST&#x003E; SHEAF</small> (&#x2018;<italic>omer</italic>) <small>&#x003C;OF YOUR HARVEST UNTO THE PRIEST&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. But I have given each and every one of you an omer, as stated (concerning the manna in Exod. 16:16): <small>AN OMER PER CAPITA</small>. Furthermore you only offered me one omer a year while I gave you manna every day, as stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL GO OUT TO GATHER</small> [<small>A DAY&#x2019;S PORTION EVERY DAY</small>].</p>
<title>4.24 Exodus 16:4ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 16:29:) <small>OBSERVE THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>OBSERVE</small> (<italic>re&#x2019;u</italic>)? R. Isaac said: <small>OBSERVE</small> (<italic>re&#x2019;u</italic>) how you reply to the peoples of the world. So if they say to you: Why do you keep the Sabbath? What miracles were done for you? <small>OBSERVE THAT THE LORD HAS GIVEN YOU THE SABBATH</small>. Say to them: On every day there came down one portion of manna; but on the day before the Sabbath, two portions. It is so stated (in Exod. 16:5): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THE SIXTH DAY, THAT WHEN THEY PREPARE WHAT THEY BRING, IT WILL BE TWOFOLD</small>&#x2026;. <small>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF TWOFOLD</small> (<italic><small>MShNH</small></italic>)? If you say two, is it not already so stated (in Exod. 16:22): <small>TWO OMERS APIECE</small>? Hezekiah bar Hiyya said that it was different (<italic><small>MShNH</small></italic>) in its taste, in its aroma, and in its appearance. And not only that, but on every day, whoever had some of it left over from evening until morning caused a stench; yet concerning the Sabbath, it is written (in vs. 24): <small>IT DID NOT HAVE A STENCH</small>. Ergo, they gathered bread <small>TWOFOLD</small> (in the sense that it was different). [(Exod. 16:22:) <small>THEN ALL THE PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION CAME AND TOLD MOSES</small>.] At that time he remembered that he had forgotten to tell them the section of Torah on the Sabbath, as the Holy One had told him. As soon as they came and spoke to him, Moses said to them (in vs. 23): <small>THIS IS WHAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN: TOMORROW IS A COMPLETE REST, A SABBATH HOLY TO THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. Jeremiah said (in Jer. 2:29): <small>WHY DO YOU COMPLAIN AGAINST ME</small>&#x2026;? Even Moses, when I told him to tell them the section of Torah on the Sabbath, forgot and did not tell them. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL OF YOU HAVE SINNED AGAINST ME</small>. R. Judah says: The Holy One honored the Sabbath in that on every day the manna came down, but on the Sabbath it did not come down. It is so stated (in Exod. 16:27): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ON THE SEVENTH DAY SOME OF THE PEOPLE WENT OUT TO GATHER &#x003C; MANNA &#x003E; AND FOUND NOTHING</small>. Moses said to them: Whoever takes an omer per capita should not take more than that, as stated (in Exod. 16:19&#x2013;20): <small>LET NO ONE LEAVE ANY OF IT &#x003C;UNTIL MORNING &#x003E;. BUT THEY DID NOT HEED MOSES, AND &#x003C;CERTAIN&#x003E; PEOPLE LEFT SOME OF IT &#x003C;UNTIL MORNING &#x003E;</small>. These were Dathan and Abiram.<sup><xref rid="fn403">77</xref></sup> R. Joshua [of Sikhnin] said in the name of R. Levi: When they left some manna, worms came out from their tents (i.e., the tents of Dathan and Abiram) and entered the tents of Israel. So the Holy Spirit cries out and says over them: Do you think that you act in secret without it being revealed to me? (Jer. 23:24:) <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small>? <small>&#x003C;SAYS THE LORD&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: In this world you have eaten manna through the merit of your ancestors; but in the world to come I will feed you cattle, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; Ziz and Leviathan. You will eat through your own merit. Thus it is stated (concerning Leviathan in Job 40:30 [41:6]): <small>SHALL TRADE ASSOCIATES MAKE A BANQUET OF HIM? SHALL THEY DIVIDE HIM UP AMONG MERCHANTS</small>?</p>

<ftnote id="fn346">20. The biblical text reads: <small>GOD DID NOT LEAD THEM IN THE WAY OF THE LAND OF THE PHILISTINES</small>. By interpreting <small>WAY OF THE LAND</small> (<small>OR EARTH</small>) separately from <small>OF THE PHILISTINES</small>, the midrash can understand the expression idiomatically to mean <small>ACCORDING TO UNIVERSAL CUSTOM</small>. See <italic>PRK</italic> 11:8; Exod. R. 20:11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347">21. On such customs, see Exod. R. 25:6; also <italic>Qid</italic>. 22b; <italic>yQid</italic>. 1:3 (59b); <italic>BB</italic> 53b.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn349">23. The Greek word means &#x201C;meeting.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350">24. Since this root also designates a brick, Lebanon becomes an allusion to the bricks made in Egypt. See Exod. R. 23:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351">25. Cf. Lev. R. 23:8; Cant. R. 4:8:1. Since the Holy One shares Israel&#x2019;s sufferings, during the Egyptian enslavement it was fitting for heaven to have something like brickwork to correspond with the mortar and bricks for which Israel was enslaved.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352">26. Since stone is harder to work than brick, the Babylonian enslavement must have been more difficult.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353">27. The midrash is explaining that the twofold repetition of the words, <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small>, is necessary because there were two enslavements. The first <small>WITH ME FROM LEBANON</small> depicts the Egyptian captivity, and the second concerns the Babylonian one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn354">28. Both the Masoretic and the Buber texts read <small>LOOK</small> (<italic>tashori</italic>) here, but the interpretation of the midrash assumes that the text reads <small>SING</small> (<italic>tashiri</italic>), a difference of a single vowel. Similarly Exod. R. 23:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn355">29. According to Exod. R. 23:5, the returning exiles would sing here, because this northern mountain marked the extreme boundary of the land of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn356">30. Cf. Exod. R. 23:5, for the reasoning behind these affirmations of merit from the three patriarchs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn357">31. The verse is consistently understood in this sense throughout Rabbinic literature. Thus the wickedness resulting in the flood had its beginning in the generation of Enosh.</ftnote>

This text is related (to Eccl. 8:10): <small>AND THEN I SAW THE WICKED BURIED, AND THEY CAME BACK</small>. Are there wicked buried who [come back] and go about?<sup><xref rid="fn404">1</xref></sup> &#x003C;It is even&#x003E; as Solomon said (ibid.): <small>BURIED, AND THEY CAME BACK</small>. However, R. Simon has said: These are wicked, in that they are dead and buried during their lifetimes.<sup><xref rid="fn405">2</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Job 15:20): <small>A WICKED PERSON WRITHES IN TORMENT ALL HIS DAYS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WRITHE IN TORMENT</small> (<italic>mitholel</italic>)? That he is dead (<italic>met</italic>) and writhing (<italic>holel</italic>).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 8:10): <small>AND THEN I SAW THE WICKED &#x003C; BURIED, AND THEY CAME BACK&#x003E;</small>. It speaks of proselytes who (after backsliding) come to repent. (Ibid.: cont.:) <small>AND THEY GO OUT FROM THE HOLY PLACE</small>. These are the synagogues and schools.<sup><xref rid="fn406">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 8:10): <small>AND THEY GO OUT FROM THE HOLY PLACE</small>. From the place where Israel [goes about, &#x003C; where &#x003E; Israel] is called holy. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THEY ARE FORGOTTEN IN THE CITY</small>, in that they make &#x003C;people&#x003E; forget their evil deeds.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 8:10): <small>&#x003C;BUT THEY ARE FORGOTTEN</small> (<italic>yishtakkehu</italic>) &#x003E;. They take pride (<italic>yishtabbehu</italic>) in that they take pride (<italic>mishtabbehim</italic>) in their good deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn407">4</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. Is this not vanity when the peoples of the world see them, &#x003C;when they see&#x003E; how they come, convert to Judaism, and enter under the wings of the Divine Presence, while they &#x003C; themselves &#x003E; do not convert to Judaism? <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. Who was this person who came and converted to Judaism as a true proselyte? This was Jethro, as stated (in Exod. 18:1): <small>NOW JETHRO &#x003C;PRIEST OF MIDIAN, MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW&#x003E;</small>, <small>HEARD</small><sup><xref rid="fn408">5</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE FOR MOSES&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5.2 Exodus 18:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 18:10:) <small>NOW JETHRO &#x003C;PRIEST OF MIDIAN, MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW&#x003E;</small>, <small>HEARD</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 1:3): <small>YOUR OILS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn409">6</xref></sup> R. Jannay said: To the ancestors you gave the fragrance of commandments. To Adam you gave seven commandments. To Noah and his children you gave seven commandments. You gave them the fragrance of commandments. But when we came to Sinai, like one who pours from the mouth of a bottle, you poured out all the commandments for us, as stated (in Cant. 1:3): <small>YOUR OILS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 1:3): <small>&#x003C;YOUR OILS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FRAGRANCE, &#x003E; YOUR NAME IS OIL POURED FORTH</small>. R. Berekhyah said: Just as the oil gives light so does the Torah give light. (Ibid., cont.): <small>THEREFORE DO THE WORLDS</small> (&#x2018;<small><italic>LMWT</italic></small>)<sup><xref rid="fn410">7</xref></sup> <small>LOVE YOU</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; this world and the world to come.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 1:3): <small>THEREFORE DO THE WORLDS LOVE YOU</small>. These are the peoples of the world, who converted to Judaism. Who was this? Jethro. When he heard what miracles were done for Israel, he came and converted to Judaism, as stated (in Exod. 18:1): <small>NOW JETHRO &#x003C; PRIEST OF MIDIAN, MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW</small> &#x003E;, <small>HEARD &#x003C;ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE FOR MOSES&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small></p>
<title>5.3 Exodus 18:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 17:8&#x2013;16)? The downfall of Amalek. Then afterwards (comes Exod. 18:1): <small>NOW JETHRO &#x003C;PRIEST OF MIDIAN, MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW&#x003E;</small>, <small>HEARD &#x003C;ALL THAT GOD HAD DONE FOR MOSES</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E; This text is related (to Prov. 19:25): <small>BEAT THE SCOFFER, AND THE SIMPLETON WILL BECOME CLEVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn411">8</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>BEAT THE SCOFFER</small>. This is Amalek. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SIMPLETON WILL BECOME CLEVER</small>. This is Jethro. When Amalek fought with Israel, what is written (in Exod. 17:8)? <small>THEN AMALEK CAME AND FOUGHT WITH ISRAEL AT REPHIDIM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN REPHIDIM</small> (<small>RPYDYM</small>)? &#x003C;It is so named&#x003E; because their hands <small>YDYM</small> had let go (rt.: <italic><small>RPY</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn412">9</xref></sup> of the commandments. And how had their hands let go? It is written (in vs. 7): <small>AND THEY CALLED THE NAME OF THE PLACE MASSAH AND MERIBAH</small><sup><xref rid="fn413">10</xref></sup> &#x003C; <small>BECAUSE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE IN CONTENTION AND BECAUSE THEY TESTED THE LORD, SAYING: IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US OR NOT</small>?&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn414">11</xref></sup> He began to cry out: How long will you test me? How long will you contend with me? And Moses also cried out (in Exod. 17:2): <small>WHY DO YOU CONTEND WITH ME? WHY DO YOU TEST THE LORD</small>? And how did they test &#x003C;him&#x003E;? R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree.<sup><xref rid="fn415">12</xref></sup> R. Judah says: They murmured and said this: If he satisfies us with food [as a king who, when he enters a province where they praise him and honor him, satisfies them with food], we will serve him; but if not, we will not serve him. R. Nehemiah says: Israel said this: If he does what we need for us [as a king who, when he enters a province where they praise him and honor him, does for them everything they need], we will serve him; but if not, we will not serve him. And our masters have said this: They reflected and said: Here we are reflecting in our heart. If he knows what we are reflecting, we will serve him; but if not, we will not serve him. Thus it is stated [(in Exod. 17:7): <small>&#x003C;THEY TESTED THE LORD, SAYING: &#x003E; IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US &#x003C;OR NOT&#x003E;</small>?] R. Berekhyah said: They may have spoken in their heart, but the Holy One granted them their petition, as stated (in Ps. 78:18): <small>THEY TESTED GOD IN THEIR HEART</small> [<small>BY ASKING FOOD FOR THEMSELVES</small>.] What is written (in vs. 29): <small>SO THEY ATE AND WERE VERY FULL</small>. The Holy One said this: You reflected in your heart. By your life I am informing you: Here is Amalek before you, as stated (in Exod. 17:8): <small>THEN AMALEK CAME</small>.</p>
<title>5.4 Exodus 18:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>To what was Israel comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn416">13</xref></sup> To one who rode on his father&#x2019;s shoulders. When he saw something he wanted and told his father to buy it for him, he bought it for him. &#x003C;Again he did&#x003E; so a second time, then a third time. As they were walking along, he saw a certain person to whom he said: Have you seen my father? [&#x003C;His father&#x003E; said to him: You ride on my shoulders, and whatever you desire I do for you. Now you say to him: Have you seen my father?] What did he do? He threw him off his shoulders. Then a dog came and bit him. So in the case of Israel, when Israel came forth from Egypt, he immediately enveloped them with clouds of glory. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they desired, the Holy One brought down manna for them. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they desired, he brought quail for them. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 78:29, cont.): <small>SO HE BROUGHT THEM WHAT THEY CRAVED</small>. He gave them everything they needed. They began to reflect and say (in Exod. 17:7): <small>IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US OR NOT</small>? The Holy One said to them: By your life, I am informing you. Behold, the dog is coming and biting you. And who is this &#x003C;dog&#x003E;? This is Amalek, as stated (in Exod. 17:8): <small>THEN AMALEK CAME</small>.</p>
<p>R. Berekhyah said: Why was his name called Amalek &#x2018;<italic><small>MLQ</small></italic>? &#x003C;They were called&#x003E; &#x2018;<italic><small>MLQ</small></italic> (i.e., a people lick), because they came to lick Israel&#x2019;s blood like a dog.</p>
<p>(Exod. 17:9:) <small>THEN MOSES SAID TO JOSHUA: CHOOSE MEN FOR US</small>&#x2026;. And why <small>TO JOSHUA</small>? In order to spur him on. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND GO OUT TO FIGHT WITH AMALEK</small>. Joshua said: How many nobler ones there are here? Aaron, Hur, and seventy elders. &#x003C;Nevertheless,&#x003E; he spoke only to me&#x0021; What is there for me to do &#x003C;but&#x003E; carry out his decree? &#x003C;Then&#x003E; immediately (in vs. 10): <small>JOSHUA DID &#x003C;AS MOSES TOLD HIM&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 17:11:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, WHEN MOSES HELD UP &#x003C;HIS HAND, ISRAEL PREVAILED&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. What happened in the end?

Therefore, when Jethro heard of the miracles which the Holy One did against Amalek, he immediately came and converted to Judaism. Ergo (in Prov. 19:25): <small>BEAT THE SCOFFER</small>. This is Amalek. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE SIMPLETON WILL BECOME CLEVER</small>. This is Jethro.</p>
<title>5.5 Exodus 18:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 18:1:) <small>NOW JETHRO PRIEST OF MIDIAN</small>, &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;, <small>HEARD</small>. He was a priest for idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn420">17</xref></sup> (Exod. 18:9:) <small>AND JETHRO REJOICED</small> (rt.: <small>YHD</small>), in that he professed (<small>YHD</small>) the name of the Holy One. Another interpretation (of Exod. 18:9:) <small>AND JETHRO REJOICED</small> (rt.: <small>YHD</small>). &#x003C;It was&#x003E; that he became a Jew (rt.: <small>YHD</small>). (Vs. 10:) <small>SO JETHRO SAID: BLESSED BE THE LORD</small>. Jethro said: I did not leave a deity alone without serving him, but I have found no deity like the God of Israel. (Vs. 11:) <small>NOW I KNOW THE LORD IS GREATER THAN ALL GODS</small>. Four children of Adam said four things. If someone else had said them, they would have laughed at them.<sup><xref rid="fn421">18</xref></sup> And who were they? Moses, Jethro, Solomon, and Nebuchadnezzar. Moses said (in Deut 32:4): <small>THE ROCK</small>&#x0021;&#x2014;<small>HIS WORK IS PERFECT</small>, [<small>BECAUSE ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE</small>]. [If someone else had said it, they would have laughed at him, saying: From where does this one know the ways of the Holy One? However,] because it is written (in Ps. 103:7): <small>HE MADE HIS WAYS KNOWN TO MOSES</small>, it is therefore stated (in Deut. 32:4): <small>THE ROCK</small>&#x0021;&#x2014;<small>HIS WORK IS PERFECT, BECAUSE ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE</small>. Then Solomon said (in Eccl. 3:11): <small>HE HAS MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME</small>. If someone else had said it, they would have laughed at him, saying: Who has made known to this one what is beautiful and what is not beautiful? But, &#x003C;in the case of&#x003E; Solomon, whose table lacked nothing, he knew what was beautiful. R. Jose bar Hanina said: Solomon&#x2019;s table did not even lack bitter herbs<sup><xref rid="fn422">19</xref></sup> of Tammuz nor <italic>melopepones</italic> &#x007B;i.e., radish and lettuce&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn423">20</xref></sup> of Tishri. Nebuchadnezzar said (in Dan. 4:32 [35]): <small>ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE OF NO ACCOUNT</small>. If another had said it, they would have laughed at him: Over what does this man rule? He does not even rule over a gnat. But in the case of Nebuchadnezzar it was fitting for him to say so, since it is stated concerning him (in Dan. 2:38): <small>AND</small> [<small>INTO YOUR HAND HE HAS GIVEN</small>] <small>THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>, [<small>THE WILD BEASTS OF THE FIELD, AND THE FOWL OF HEAVEN</small>,] <small>WHEREVER THEY MAY DWELL</small>; [<small>AND HE HAS HAD YOU RULE OVER ALL OF THEM</small>]. Jethro said (in Exod. 18:11): <small>NOW I KNOW THE LORD IS GREATER THAN ALL GODS</small>, because among all his gods he did not see one as great as the Lord. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YES, BY THE THING WHICH &#x003C;THE EGYPTIANS&#x003E; PLOTTED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn424">21</xref></sup> R. Eleazar said: By that with which the Egyptians intended to destroy Israel, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; by water, by that they were destroyed. So they were drowned in the midst of the sea.</p>
<title>5.6 Exodus 18:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Exod. 18:5&#x2013;6:) <small>NOW JETHRO, MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW CAME</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND HE SAID UNTO MOSES: I AM YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW</small>&#x2026;. Who said to Moses: <small>I AM YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW</small>? He was unable to come to Moses. What did he do? He wrote a letter and tied it on an arrow. Then he shot, and the arrow came to Moses. Moses read it and went out to him, as stated (in vs. 7): <small>SO MOSES WENT OUT TO MEET JETHRO</small>. He entered the camp along with him. What is written (in vs. 12)? <small>AND AARON CAME WITH ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL TO EAT BREAD &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD WITH MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>FATHER-IN-LAW</small> &#x003E;. When they had eaten with him, he said: Give me permission to go to my &#x003C;own&#x003E; place. Moses said to him (in Numb. 10:32): <small>IT SHALL BE THAT, IF YOU COME WITH US, IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT WHATEVER GOOD THE LORD DOES FOR US WE WILL DO FOR YOU</small>. &#x003C;Jethro&#x003E; said to him: I want to go and utter the Holy One&#x2019;s praise in my own place. Immediately (in Exod. 18:27): <small>MOSES SENT HIS FATHER-IN-LAW AWAY</small>&#x2026;. Now when the Holy One does miracles for Israel, they praise him [and the nations of the world praise him]. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 138:4): &#x007B;<small>THESE PEOPLES</small>&#x007D; <small>ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SHALL GIVE THANKS TO YOU</small>, [<small>O LORD</small>,] <small>FOR THEY HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH</small>.</p>

David said: When I wanted to get counsel, I got it from the Torah, as stated (in Ps. 119:15): <small>I WILL MEDITATE ON YOUR STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. Ben Zoma says: What is written (in Exod. 19:1)? <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON &#x003C;AFTER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LEFT THE LAND OF EGYPT, ON THIS DAY THEY CAME TO THE DESERT OF SINAI</small>. &#x003E; &#x201C;On that day&#x201D; [is not written here, but <small>ON THIS DAY</small>,] as though <small>ON THIS DAY</small> (i.e., today) <small>THEY CAME TO THE DESERT OF SINAI</small>, &#x003C; namely, &#x003E; on every day that you are busy at Torah. Ergo, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; speaks as though on this day I received it from Sinai. Thus it says (in Deut. 26:16): <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM THESE STATUTES</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5.8 Exodus 19:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>.

Its letters are threefold: <small>ABC</small>. The fathers are threefold: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

<title>5.9 Exodus 19:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 3:17): <small>&#x003C;WISDOM&#x2019;S&#x003E; WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, &#x003C;AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn430">27</xref></sup> The Holy One wanted to give Torah to Israel at the time that Israel came forth from Egypt, but they were disagreeing with each other and were always saying (in Numb. 14:4): <small>LET US APPOINT A LEADER AND RETURN TO EGYPT</small>. What is written (in Exod. 13:20)? <small>THEY JOURNEYED FROM SUCCOTH AND ENCAMPED AT ETHAM</small>, because they were journeying in dissension and camping in dissension. When they came to Rephidim, they all became harmonious and formed a single group. And where is it shown that they all formed a single group? Where it is stated (in Exod. 19:2): <small>AND ISRAEL ENCAMPED THERE BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN</small>. The plural form of &#x201C;encamped&#x201D; is not written here but &#x201C;encamped&#x201D; in the singular.<sup><xref rid="fn431">28</xref></sup> The Holy One said: All of the Torah is peace. So to whom shall I give it? To a people that loves peace. Ergo (in Prov. 3:17): <small>&#x003C;WISDOM&#x2019;S WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, &#x003E; AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>.</p>
<title>5.10 Exodus 19:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Eccl. 10:18): <small>THROUGH SLOTH THE ROOF SAGS, &#x003C;AND THROUGH LAZY HANDS THE HOUSE LEAKS</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn432">29</xref></sup> What causes a woman to discharge excessive blood (in her menstrual flow)? &#x003C;It happens&#x003E; because she is slothful in examining herself as to whether she is ritually unclean or not. &#x003C;This opinion&#x003E; is in accordance with what our masters taught (in <italic>Nid</italic>. 2:1): <small>EVERY HAND THAT FREQUENTLY EXAMINES</small> (for menstrual symptoms), behold, <small>IN THE CASE OF WOMEN</small> this &#x003C;hand&#x003E; <small>IS PRAISEWORTHY, BUT IN THE CASE OF MEN, LET IT BE CUT OFF</small>. There is a story about a female slave who belonged to Rabban Gamaliel. While she was moving &#x003C;ritually clean&#x003E; cups<sup><xref rid="fn433">30</xref></sup> and wine jugs from house to house, she examined herself at each and every jug. At the last one she examined herself and was found to be unclean. Rabban Gamaliel was afraid, saying: Perhaps the clean ones have been become unclean&#x0021; He said to her: Did you not examine yourself? She said to him: By your life, My Lord, I examined myself between each and every jug, but at the last one I examined myself and was found to be unclean. Rabban Gamaliel said: If this woman had been slothful, all the clean ones would already have been unclean. (Eccl. 10:18:) <small>THROUGH SLOTH THE ROOF SAGS</small>. Note that because a woman is slothful, she discharges excessive blood. Now <small>THE ROOF</small> (<small>MQRH</small>) can only be excessive blood, since it is stated (in Lev. 20:18): <small>THUS HE HAS UNCOVERED HER FOUNTAIN</small> (<small>MQRH</small>) <small>&#x003C;AND SHE HAS BARED THE FOUNTAIN</small> (<small>MQRH</small>) <small>OF HER BLOOD&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn434">31</xref></sup> (Eccl. 10:18, cont.:) <small>AND THROUGH LAZY HANDS &#x003C;THE HOUSE&#x003E;</small> (of her body) <small>LEAKS</small>. (Lev. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD &#x003C;FOR MANY DAYS&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 10:18): <small>THROUGH SLOTH THE ROOF SAGS, &#x003C;AND THROUGH LAZY HANDS THE HOUSE LEAKS</small>. &#x003E; It speaks of Israel when they came to Rephidim. Why was it called Rephidim (<small>RPYDYM</small>)? Because there their hands were slothful (<small>RPW YDYHM</small>) from transgressions. What is written (in Jud. 5:4): <small>THE EARTH TREMBLED, EVEN THE HEAVENS DRIPPED</small>&#x2026;. When did all these things happen? On the day that Torah was given.</p>
<title>5.11 Exodus 19:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>. What is written above on the matter? The parashah about Jethro, in which he taught Moses (in Exod. 18:21): <small>YOU SHALL ALSO SEEK OUT &#x003C;ABLE MEN&#x003E; FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn435">32</xref></sup> And after that (in vs. 27): <small>THEN MOSES SENT HIS &#x003C; FATHER-IN-LAW &#x003E; AWAY</small>. And after that (in Exod. 19:1): <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>. Solomon said (in Prov. 14:10): <small>THE HEART KNOWS ITS OWN BITTERNESS</small>&#x2026;, and therefore (according to the rest of the verse) <small>NO OUTSIDER SHALL INTERVENE IN ITS JOY</small>. The Holy One said: My children were enslaved with clay and bricks while Jethro was dwelling quietly within his house. So shall he come to behold the joy of the Torah along with my children? Then after that (in Exod. 19:1): <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>. Why so? Moses interpreted &#x003C;the matter on the principle of &#x003E; <italic>qal wahomer</italic> (i.e., a fortiori): If in the case of a single precept, when the Holy One was going to give the precept on Passover, Torah said (in Exod. 12:43): <small>NO FOREIGNER SHALL EAT OF IT</small>; in the case of six hundred and thirteen commandments which he wanted to give to Israel, should Jethro be there to behold them? Therefore (in Exod. 18:27): <small>MOSES SENT HIS &#x003C;FATHER-IN-LAW&#x003E; AWAY</small>; and after that (in Exod. 19:1): <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>. Why <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>, and not on the second new moon, or the seventh new moon, or on another new moon?<sup><xref rid="fn436">33</xref></sup> Our masters have said: R. Osha&#x2018;ya said: R. Hiyya the elder taught me: A female proselyte, a female captive, or an emancipated female slave may neither marry nor be betrothed for three new moons.<sup><xref rid="fn437">34</xref></sup> So &#x003C;it was with&#x003E; Israel. They were called proselytes (<italic>gerim</italic>), as stated (in Lev. 19:34): <small>FOR YOU WERE STRANGERS</small> (<italic>gerim</italic>) <small>IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. &#x003C;They were called&#x003E; captives, as stated (in Is. 14:2): <small>THEY SHALL TAKE THEIR CAPTORS CAPTIVE</small>. &#x003C;They were called&#x003E; emancipated slaves, as stated (in Lev. 26:13): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT TO BE THEIR SLAVES NO MORE</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: I will wait three new moons for them and after that I will give them the Torah.</p>
<title>5.12 Exodus 19:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE NEW MOON</small> (<italic>bahodesh</italic>), <small>&#x003C;THE THIRD ONE</small> &#x003E;. <italic>Ba hodesh</italic> (understood as two words) &#x003C; means &#x003E; <small>THE NEW MOON HAS COME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn438">35</xref></sup> R. Abbin said: When the Holy One appeared to Moses on Sinai, he said to him (in Exod. 3:12): <small>WHEN YOU HAVE BROUGHT</small> &#x007B;<small>THIS</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE</small>] <small>PEOPLE OUT OF EGYPT, YOU SHALL SERVE &#x003C;GOD ON THIS MOUNTAIN&#x003E;</small>. Now Moses was eagerly waiting and saying: When is this designated time coming? However, when [the designated time] did arrive, the Holy One said, <small>THE NEW MOON HAS COME</small>, &#x003C;namely the one&#x003E; that you have been eagerly awaiting. It does not say (in Exod. 19:1): &#x201C;In the third moon,&#x201D; even as it says (in I Kings 6:37): <small>THE MOON OF ZIV</small>, (in vs. 38:) <small>THE MOON OF BUL</small>, &#x003C;or&#x003E; (as in 8:2) <small>THE MOON OF ETHANIM</small>. Rather it says (here in Exod. 19:1): <small>ON THE</small> [<small>THIRD</small>] <small>NEW MOON</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HDSh</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn439">36</xref></sup> R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The Holy One said to them: I am making a renewal (rt.: <small>HD<italic>Sh</italic></small>) of things and renewing (rt.: <small>HD<italic>Sh</italic></small>) you. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. When he reached his maturity, his father wanted to have him marry; but he did not have a new <italic>argentaria</italic><sup><xref rid="fn440">37</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., court&#x007D;. The king said: This is not the honor due my son, to have him marry &#x007B;in an old court&#x007D; [it should read: with an old <italic>argentaria</italic>]; yet if I wait until I provide him with a new one, I shall delay my son&#x2019;s happiness. What did the king do? He brought smiths and artisans to polish vessels of copper. He brought skilled workers to carve designs on vessels of wood. [&#x003C;Thus&#x003E; the king was able to have his son marry with an old <italic>argentaria</italic> which appeared to be new (rt.: <small>HD<italic>Sh</italic></small>).] So too, when Israel went forth out of Egypt, the blind, the deaf, and the lame were among them. The Holy One said: [The Torah, all of it, is complete, as stated (in Ps. 19:8 [7]): <small>THE TORAH OF THE LORD IS PERFECT</small>.] Shall I give it to this generation when there are deformities among them? Shall I wait until their children arise? Shall I delay the joy of Torah? What did the Holy One do? He healed them. Then he gave them the Torah. But where is it shown [that he healed them]? Whoever was blind saw, as stated (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small>&#x2026;. Whoever was deaf was made to hear, as stated (in Exod. 24:7): <small>ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small> (literally: <small>HEAR</small>). Whoever was lame was made whole, as stated (in Exod. 19:17): <small>AND THEY STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN</small>. Ergo: I will establish (rt.: <small>HD<italic>Sh</italic></small>) a renewal of things (rt.: <small>HD<italic>Sh</italic></small>) for you.</p>
<title>5.13 Exodus 19:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Exod. 19:1:) <small>ON THE THIRD NEW MOON</small>. Why in the month of Gemini?<sup><xref rid="fn441">38</xref></sup> So that the nations of the world would have no pretext for saying: If he had given us the Torah, we should have fulfilled it. The Holy One said to them: Observe in what month I gave the Torah&#x0021; &#x003C;It was&#x003E; under the sign of Gemini (i.e., of the Twins). Thus if &#x003C;Jacob&#x2019;s twin&#x003E; Esau the Wicked would come to be a proselyte, he also would learn Torah. For that reason Torah was given under Gemini.</p>
<p>(Exod. 19:1:) <small>&#x003C;ON THE THIRD NEW MOON AFTER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LEFT THE LAND OF EGYPT, &#x003E; ON THIS DAY THEY CAME TO THE DESERT OF SINAI</small>. Did they come on this very day?<sup><xref rid="fn442">39</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;NO</small>&#x0021; &#x003E; But rather, when you study &#x003C;the words of Torah&#x003E; let them not be obsolete in your eyes. &#x003C;Let them be&#x003E; instead like these &#x003C; words &#x003E; given this day. &#x201C;That day&#x201D; is not written, but <small>THIS DAY</small>. The Holy One said to them: On this day I have given them the Torah (collectively), but &#x003C;only&#x003E; individuals have labored in it. In the world to come, however, I will teach it to all Israel; and none of them shall forget it. Thus it is stated (in Jer. 31:33): <small>FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT WHICH I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD</small>: [<small>I WILL PUT MY TORAH IN THEIR INNERMOST PARTS, AND UPON THEIR HEART WILL I WRITE IT</small>.] And not only that, but I will increase peace among them.

For that reason he descended with twenty-two thousand corresponding &#x003C;in number&#x003E; to the host of Levites. Another interpretation (of Ps. 68:18 [17]): <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWO MYRIADS, THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small> (<italic>shin&#x2019;an</italic>). &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that twenty-two thousand chariots came down with the Holy One.] Each and every chariot was like the chariot which Ezekiel saw, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; a chariot of God. <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD</small>. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: They all came down with sharp (<italic>shenunim</italic>) swords to destroy the enemies of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn446">43</xref></sup> For if they (Israel) had not accepted the Torah they would have destroyed them. R. Levi said: It is simply that they had seen the face of the Divine Presence; and whoever sees the face of the Divine Presence does not die, as stated (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING&#x2019;S FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 68:18 [17]): <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWO MYRIADS, &#x003C;THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small> (<italic>alfe shin&#x2019;an</italic>) &#x003E;. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: What is the meaning of <italic>alfe shin&#x2019;an</italic> (&#x2018;<small>LPY <italic>ShN&#x2019;N</italic></small>)? The most handsome (<small>HN&#x2019;YM,</small> rt.: <italic><small>N&#x2019;H</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn447">44</xref></sup> and the most excellent<sup><xref rid="fn448">45</xref></sup> of them (i.e., of the angels). Nevertheless, the Lord stood out among them, &#x003C;so that&#x003E; the congregation of Israel said (in Cant. 5:10): <small>MY BELOVED IS BRIGHT AND RUDDY, &#x003C;THE MOST PROMINENT OF TEN THOUSAND</small> &#x003E;. &#x003C;When&#x003E; a king of flesh and blood goes forth into the field,<sup><xref rid="fn449">46</xref></sup> how many are as handsome as he? How many are as valiant as he? With the Holy One, however, the situation is different. When he came to Sinai, he took along with him the most handsome and the most excellent of the ministering angels. R. Judah b. R. Simon said: what is written (in Deut. 33:2)? <small>HE</small> (the Lord) <small>APPEARED FROM MOUNT PARAN, AND ARRIVED</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ata</italic>) <small>FROM HOLY MYRIADS</small>. Thus he was <small>A BEACON</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ot</italic>) in the midst of <small>HOLY MYRIADS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn450">47</xref></sup> There is no one like him. Who is comparable to him&#x0021; R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: Wherever there are great throngs,<sup><xref rid="fn451">48</xref></sup> there is a pressing together. On Sinai, however, when the Holy One came, there came down with him thousands of thousands and a myriad of myriads (rt.: <small>RBH</small>), (according to Ps. 68:18 [17]) <small>THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small>; yet there was space for them. R. Eleazar ben Azariah and R. Eleazar of Modim made the following statements: One said: But would the mountain have contained them? The Holy One said to it: Widen (rt.: <small>RHB</small>) and lengthen yourself to receive the children of your Lord. But the other said: When the Holy One returns to Jerusalem, he will bring the diaspora back into it. It is so stated (in Is. 49:12): <small>LOOK</small>&#x0021; <small>THESE ARE COMING</small> &#x007B;<small>TO YOU</small>&#x007D; <small>FROM AFAR</small>&#x2026;. But will &#x003C;that city&#x003E; be able to contain them? The Holy One has told it (in Is. 54:2): <small>ENLARGE</small> (<small>RHB</small>) <small>THE SITE OF YOUR TABERNACLE</small>. (Ps. 68:18 [17], cont.): <small>THE LORD IS AMONG THEM, &#x003C;AS IN SINAI, SO IN THE HOLY PLACE</small>. &#x003E; Resh Laqish said: There is a tablet<sup><xref rid="fn452">49</xref></sup> over the heart of each and every angel where the name of the Holy One is joined with the name of each and every angel: &#x003C;e.g.,&#x003E; Michael (which means, &#x201C;Who is like God?&#x201D;) and Raphael (which means, &#x201C;God has healed.&#x201D;) (Ps. 68:18 [17], cont.): <small>THE LORD IS IN THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn453">50</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.15 Exodus 20:2ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 20:2:) <small>I AM THE LORD</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 50:7): <small>HEARKEN, O MY PEOPLE, AND LET ME SPEAK, O ISRAEL, SO THAT I MAY ADMONISH YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn454">51</xref></sup> R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: <small>HEARKEN, O MY PEOPLE, AND LET ME SPEAK</small>, so that I may have a chance to speak (in your defense) to the nations of the world. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: Formerly your names were like the names of the nations of the world, &#x003C;e.g.&#x003E; Seba and Havilah; but since you have accepted the Torah, your name has been Israel, as stated (in Ps. 50:7): <small>HEARKEN, O MY PEOPLE, AND LET ME SPEAK</small>, [<small>O ISRAEL, SO THAT I MAY ADMONISH YOU</small>]. One only speaks to someone who hearkens. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I AM GOD, YOUR GOD. I AM GOD</small>. I am judge, I am patron.<sup><xref rid="fn455">52</xref></sup> I am established on your behalf. R. Simeon says: <small>I AM YOUR GOD</small>, I am your patron. Just as the patron is an asset with the judge, &#x003C;even so&#x003E; <small>I AM GOD, YOUR GOD</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: <small>&#x003C;GOD, I AM YOUR GOD</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn456">53</xref></sup> To whom was he speaking? To Moses. Even though I have called you a <small>GOD</small>, as stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>; still <small>I AM YOUR GOD</small>. What is the meaning of I (&#x2018;<small>NKY</small>)?<sup><xref rid="fn457">54</xref></sup> Our masters have said: The word is an &#x003C;Aramaic&#x003E; acronym:<sup><xref rid="fn458">55</xref></sup> I (&#x2018;<italic>ana</italic>) myself (<italic>nafshi</italic>) have written (<italic>ketavit</italic>) &#x003C;and&#x003E; have given (<italic>yehavit</italic>) &#x003C;it&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn459">56</xref></sup> R.

When you accepted the Ten Commandments.</p>
<title>5.16 Exodus 20:2ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 20:2:) <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>&#x2026;. R. Aha said: For twenty-six generations (between creation and the giving of Torah) the <italic>alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn460">57</xref></sup> kept making a complaint before the Holy One, saying: Even though I am the first of all the letters, you did not create the world with me but with a <italic>bet</italic> (i.e., in Gen. 1:1): <small>IN THE BEGINNING</small> (<italic>Bereshit</italic>) <small>GOD CREATED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn461">58</xref></sup> The Holy One said: By your life, I will repay you with the Torah, which was created two thousand years before the world was created;<sup><xref rid="fn462">59</xref></sup> and when I come to give Torah to Israel, I will begin &#x007B;according to&#x007D; [with] you (in Exod. 20:2): I (<italic>Anokhi</italic>) <small>AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Nehemiah said: What is &#x2018;<italic>anokhi</italic>? It is an Egyptian word. To what is the matter comparable? To a king whose son was captured and spent a long time with the captors. He learned the speech of those captors. When &#x003C;his father&#x003E; had taken vengeance on his enemies and brought him &#x003C;back&#x003E;, he went to converse with him in his own language; but he did not know it. What did he do? He began to speak with him in the language of his captors. Thus did the Holy One do with Israel. During all those years that Israel had been in Egypt, they had learned the Egyptian speech. When the Holy One had redeemed them, he came to give them the Torah, &#x003C;but&#x003E; they did not know how to understand it. The Holy One said: Here, I shall converse with them in the Egyptian language. &#x2018;<italic>Anokh</italic>. In Egypt, when one wants to say &#x201C;I&#x201D; to a friend, he says: &#x2018;<italic>anokh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn463">60</xref></sup> Thus the Holy One began in their language and said (in Exod. 20:2): I (&#x2018;<italic>anokhi</italic>).</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Since the Holy One had appeared to them in the sea as a warrior making war (Exod. 15:3), appeared to them on Sinai as a scribe teaching Torah, appeared to them in the days of Solomon as a youth (Cant. 5:15), and appeared to them in the days of Daniel as an elder (Dan. 7:9, 13, 22); the Holy One said to them: Even though they saw me in many forms, I am the one who was in the sea; I am the one who was on Sinai; <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.</p>
<p>R. Hiyya bar Abba said: He appeared to them in &#x003C;a form that was&#x003E; appropriate for each and every concern, and so in each and every matter. In the sea &#x003C;it was&#x003E; as a warrior &#x003C;that&#x003E; he waged the wars of Israel. On Sinai he taught Torah to Israel and served as a scribe. In the days of Daniel he taught Torah as an elder, for so it is fitting for Torah to be coming from the mouths of the elders. He appeared to them as a youth in the days of Solomon as was fitting for their deeds, as stated (in Cant. 5:15): <small>HIS VISAGE IS LIKE LEBANON, YOUNG AS THE CEDARS</small>.</p>
<title>5.17 Exodus 20:2ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 20:2): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Hanina bar Pappa said: The Holy One appeared to them with an angry face, with a neutral face, with a friendly face, &#x003C;and&#x003E; with a laughing face.<sup><xref rid="fn464">61</xref></sup> An angry face is for Scripture. When someone teaches his child Torah, he is obligated to teach him with fear. A neutral face is for Mishnah. A friendly face is for Talmud. A laughing one is for Aggadah. The Holy One said to them: Even though you see all these likenesses, (according to Exod. 20:2) <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Levi said: The Holy One appeared to them as an image<sup><xref rid="fn465">62</xref></sup> with faces on every side. If a thousand people were looking at it, it would be looking &#x003C;back&#x003E; at all of them. So it is with the Holy One. When he spoke, each and every person of Israel said: The Divine Word has been with me &#x003C; alone &#x003E;. What is written (in Exod. 20:2) is &#x003C;this&#x003E;: <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small> (with <small>YOUR</small> in the singular). R. Jose bar Hanina said: It was according to the capacity of each and every person that the Divine Word spoke with him, and do not be surprised at this fact. Since we find in the case of the manna that, when it came down to Israel, each one of them savored it according to his capacity (<italic>koah</italic>), how much the more &#x003C;would the principle apply&#x003E; with the Divine Word&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn466">63</xref></sup> David said (in Ps. 29:4): <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD IS IN POWER</small> (<italic>koah</italic>). &#x201C;In his power&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>IN POWER</small> (<italic>bakoah</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; according to the capacity (<italic>bakoah</italic>) of each and every person. In this world Israel was redeemed from Egypt and enslaved in Babylon, &#x003C; redeemed &#x003E; from Babylon &#x003C;and enslaved &#x003E; to Media, &#x003C; redeemed &#x003E; from Media and &#x003C; enslaved &#x003E; to Greece, &#x003C; redeemed &#x003E; from Greece and enslaved to Edom (i.e., to Rome). But the Holy One will redeem them from Edom, and they shall be enslaved no more, as stated (in Is. 45:17): <small>ISRAEL HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE LORD WITH AN EVERLASTING SALVATION</small>. [<small>YOU SHALL NEITHER BE ASHAMED NOR CONFOUNDED FOREVER AND EVER</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn467">64</xref></sup></p>

After he had passed by, he thought: It is written in the Torah (in Exod. 23:5): <small>WHEN YOU SEE THE DONKEY OF ONE WHO HATES YOU &#x003C;LYING DOWN UNDER ITS BURDEN</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;, [<small>YOU MUST SURELY ASSIST HIM</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn470">3</xref></sup> He immediately returned and shared the load with him. He began to consider &#x003C;the matter &#x003E; in his heart. He thought: So-and-so actually loves me,<sup><xref rid="fn471">4</xref></sup> and I did not know it&#x0021; They entered an inn,<sup><xref rid="fn472">5</xref></sup> to eat and drink. Who caused them to make peace? &#x003C;It happened&#x003E; because this person considered the Torah. (Ps. 99:4, cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED UPRIGHTNESS</small>&#x2026;. What is this? This is justice (<italic>mishpat</italic>).</p>
<title>6.2 Exodus 21:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 21:1:) <small>AND THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES</small> (<italic>mishpatim</italic>). This text is related (to Prov. 29:4): <small>BY JUSTICE</small> (mishpat) <small>A KING SUSTAINS THE LAND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn473">6</xref></sup> This refers to the Holy One. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A PERSON OF REMOVALS</small> (<italic>temurot</italic>) <small>WILL DESTROY IT</small>. This refers to the first Adam who was separated out in a removal (<italic>temurah</italic>). R. Jose ben Qetsartah said: Where is it shown that he was separated out in a removal?<sup><xref rid="fn474">7</xref></sup> Where it is stated (in Gen. 2:6&#x2013;7): <small>BUT A MIST WENT UP FROM THE EARTH &#x003C;AND WATERED THE WHOLE FACE OF THE GROUND</small>&#x003E;. <small>THEN THE LORD FORMED &#x003C;THE HUMAN OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn475">8</xref></sup> &#x003C;It is&#x003E; like the wife of a priest putting water into the midst of her dough and after that taking the <italic>hallah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn476">9</xref></sup> <italic>Ergo</italic>, it says (in Prov. 29:4): <small>BUT A PERSON OF REMOVALS</small> (<italic>temurot</italic>) <small>WILL DESTROY IT</small>. When the Holy One commanded him to eat from this and not to eat from that, he transgressed the command. What did he bring about? (Gen. 3:17:) <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>. Ergo, (in Prov. 29:4): <small>&#x003C;BUT A PERSON OF REMOVALS &#x003E; WILL DESTROY IT</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 29:4): <small>BY JUSTICE</small> (<italic>mishpat</italic>) <small>A KING SUSTAINS &#x003C;THE LAND</small>&#x003E;. This refers to the Holy One. When he came to give Torah to Israel, he began with an ordinance (<italic>mishpat</italic>). What is written (in Exod. 15:25): <small>THERE HE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE</small>, and &#x003C;it was&#x003E; here &#x003C;that&#x003E; Moses learned the ordinances which he taught Israel.</p>
<p>R. Abbahu said: Wherever <small>THESE</small> is used, it cancels what precedes; and wherever <small>AND THESE</small> is written, it adds to what precedes.<sup><xref rid="fn477">10</xref></sup> It is written (in Gen. 2:4): <small>THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS &#x003C; AND THE EARTH</small>. &#x003E; What did <small>&#x003C;THESE</small>&#x003E; cancel? It canceled (Gen. 1:2:) <small>AND THE EARTH WAS VOID AND WITHOUT FORM WITH DARKNESS</small>. And so (in Exod. 21:1): <small>AND THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES</small> adds to what precedes (i.e., Exod. 15:25): <small>THERE HE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.3 Exodus 21:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 21:1:) <small>AND THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 147:19&#x2013;20): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, &#x003C;HIS STATUTES AND ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL</small>&#x003E;. <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION; &#x003C;AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn478">11</xref></sup> Aquila the son of Hadrian&#x2019;s sister wanted to convert to Judaism, but he was afraid of his uncle Hadrian.<sup><xref rid="fn479">12</xref></sup> He said to him: I want to engage in a business. He said to him: Do you perhaps lack silver or gold? Here, you have the treasury<sup><xref rid="fn480">13</xref></sup> before you. He said to him: I want to engage in a business in order to gain knowledge of humanity, and I want to consult you on how to do it. He said to him: Go and engage in any business<sup><xref rid="fn481">14</xref></sup> that you see established on earth, since in the end it will increase (<italic>hit&#x2018;allah</italic>) &#x003C;in value &#x003E;. Now he intended to convert to Judaism. He came to the land of Israel and studied the Torah. When R. Eliezer and R. Joshua came to him after some time, they found him and saw his face transformed. They said to each other: Aquila has been studying the Torah. When they came to him, he began to ask them questions, and they would answer him. He went up to Hadrian. He said to him: Why is your face transformed? Has your business failed, or is someone troubling you? He told him: No. Then why has your face been transformed? He said to him: Because I have been studying Torah. And not only that, but I have been circumcised. He said to him: And who told you &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;? He said to him: I consulted with you. He said to him: When? He said to him: When I told you I wanted to engage in a business, you told me: Engage in any business that you see established on earth, since in the end it will increase (<italic>hit&#x2019;allah</italic>) &#x003C;in value&#x003E;. So I went back over all the peoples and did not find &#x003C;any&#x003E; people established on earth like Israel. Now in the end they will be exalted (<italic>hit&#x2019;allah</italic>), just as Isaiah has said (in Is. 49:7): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD, THE REDEEMER OF ISRAEL, HIS HOLY ONE, TO</small> &#x007B;<small>ONE WHO DESPISES ONE</small>&#x2019;s&#x007D; [<small>A DESPICABLE</small>] <small>SOUL, TO AN ABHORRENT NATION, TO A SLAVE OF RULERS: &#x003C; KINGS SHALL SEE, AND NOBLES SHALL RISE UP. AND THEY SHALL PROSTRATE THEMSELVES ON ACCOUNT OF THE LORD, WHO IS FAITHFUL, EVEN THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL, BECAUSE HE HAS CHOSEN YOU</small>.&#x003E; His associate regent<sup><xref rid="fn482">15</xref></sup> said to him: Are these whom you have been annihilating going to be those before whom kings will stand, as stated (in Is. 49:7): <small>KINGS SHALL SEE AND RISE UP; NOBLES ALSO SHALL PROSTRATE THEMSELVES</small>? Hadrian hit him on the jaw. He said to him: One only puts a bandage on a wound. Would [someone] put it on sound flesh? Would he not put it on a wound? Now if one sees some common soldier,<sup><xref rid="fn483">16</xref></sup> he does not stand in his presence.<sup><xref rid="fn484">17</xref></sup> What did his associate regent do? He went up on the roof, fell down, and died. Thus the Holy Spirit cries out (in Jud. 5:31): <small>SO SHALL ALL YOUR ENEMIES PERISH, O LORD</small>. Hadrian said to Aquila: Why did you do this? He said to him: Because I wanted to learn Torah. He said to him: You could have learned it without becoming circumcised. He said to him: Without circumcising, one could not learn it, as stated (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB</small>, [<small>HIS STATUTES AND ORDINANCES</small> (<italic>mishpatim</italic>) <small>TO ISRAEL. TO JACOB</small>:] To whoever from Jacob practices circumcision. <small>HIS STATUTES</small>: This means Torah. <small>AND ORDINANCES</small>: These are the laws. [Thus it is stated] (in Exod. 15:25): <small>THERE HE ESTABLISHED FOR THEM</small> [<small>A STATUTE AND AN ORDINANCE</small> (<italic>mishpat</italic>)]. The Holy One said to Moses: I have given them the Torah; you give them the ordinances (mishpatim). The Holy One said to them: If you desire to survive in this world, observe the ordinances (<italic>mishpatim</italic>), for &#x007B;one&#x007D; [a world] cannot survive without justice (<italic>mishpat</italic>). The generation of the flood would not have perished from the world, had they not transgressed against justice (<italic>mishpat</italic>). R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: What is written about them (in Job 4:20)? <small>FROM MORNING TO EVENING THEY ARE SHATTERED; THEY PERISH FOREVER WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING</small> (rt.: <small>SYM</small>). Ergo (in Exod. 21:1): <small>AND THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES</small> (<italic>mishpatim</italic>) <small>&#x003C;THAT YOU SHALL SET</small> (rt.: <small>SYM</small>) <small>BEFORE THEM</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn485">18</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.4 Exodus 21:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>R. Eleazar said: If there is judgement (<italic>din</italic>) below there is no judgement above; if there is no judgement above, there is judgement below.<sup><xref rid="fn486">19</xref></sup> How so? If those below carry out a judgement, there is no judgement above? For this reason the Holy One said: Observe justice (<italic>mishpat</italic>) below so that you will not cause me to carry out justice (mishpat) above.<sup><xref rid="fn487">20</xref></sup> Ergo (in Exod. 21:1): <small>AND THESE ARE THE ORDINANCES</small> (<italic>mishpatim</italic>). The Holy One said to them: Whatever I do, I do with justice (<italic>din</italic>). Thus, had I desired to transgress against justice (<italic>din</italic>) one time, the world would have been unable to survive. Isaiah has said (in Is. 27:4): <small>THERE IS NO ANGER IN ME</small>. [<small>WOULD THAT HE WOULD GIVE ME THORNS AND THISTLES. I WOULD STEP FORTH AGAINST THEM IN BATTLE. I WOULD SET THEM ON FIRE ALL TOGETHER</small>.] Had I walked one step and disregarded judgment (<italic>din</italic>), <small>I WOULD SET THEM ON FIRE ALL TOGETHER</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; the world would have burned immediately. (Is. 27:5:) <small>OR LET HIM TAKE HOLD OF MY PROTECTION</small>, when my hand is seized in justice (<italic>din</italic>), [as stated (in Deut. 32:41):] <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small> (<italic>mishpat</italic>). (Is. 27:5, cont.:) <small>AND LET HIM MAKE PEACE FOR ME</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; <small>LET HIM MAKE PEACE</small> between me and the judgement (mishpat). (Deut. 32:41:) <small>IF I SHARPEN</small> (rt.: <small>SNN</small>) <small>MY FLASHING SWORD</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; if I should change (rt.: <small>SNH</small>) the measure of judgement (din), a single flash of lightning would go forth to destroy the world. What should I do? (Deut. 32:41, cont.:) <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small> (<italic>mishpat</italic>). The Holy One said: I am called the Lord of Justice (mishpat, rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>PT</small>), and I want to stretch out (rt.: <small>PS<italic>hT</italic></small>) my hand against Esau. Still I am unable &#x003C;to do so&#x003E; until I pay him a reward for a small favor which he did for me in this world. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said:<sup><xref rid="fn488">21</xref></sup> Look at what is written (in Zech. 12:9): <small>SO IT WILL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY</small> &#x007B;<small>SAYS THE LORD</small>&#x007D; <small>THAT I WILL SEEK TO DESTROY ALL THE NATIONS</small>. Israel says to him: Sovereign of the World, then who will stay your hand, since you are saying: <small>I SEEK</small>? The Holy One said: It is simply that, when <small>I SEEK</small> their merit and do not find it, then <small>I WILL SEEK TO DESTROY ALL THE NATIONS</small>. R. Levi said: What is written (in Dan. 7:9)? <small>I LOOKED UNTIL THRONES WERE THROWN DOWN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn489">22</xref></sup> The Holy One said: When I acquit some of the nations of the world &#x003C;for&#x003E; a few simple commandments which they have carried out in my presence, &#x003C;it is&#x003E; during that &#x003C; limited &#x003E; time, <small>UNTIL THRONES WERE THROWN DOWN</small>. &#x003C;It is those &#x003E; thrones belonging to the nations of the world that the Holy One is going to overturn, as stated (in Hag. 2:22): <small>THEN I WILL OVERTURN THE THRONES OF</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D;<small>KINGDOMS</small> [<small>AND DESTROY THE MIGHT OF THE KINGDOMS</small>] <small>OF THE NATIONS</small>. At that time I will &#x003C;also&#x003E; redeem you so that you shall be enslaved no more, as stated (in Nahum 1:12): <small>THOUGH I HAVE AFFLICTED YOU, I WILL AFFLICT YOU NO MORE</small>.</p>
<title>6.5 Exodus 22:24 [25]ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY TO MY PEOPLE, &#x003C;TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU, YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON</small>, whoever is quick to plunder the money of his comrade, <small>MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH, AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY</small> (<italic>heser</italic>) <small>WILL COME TO HIM</small>, that a lack (<italic>heseron</italic>) will come upon him. This man was Ephron the Hittite.<sup><xref rid="fn490">23</xref></sup> When Abraham said (in Gen. 23:4&#x2013;6): <small>GIVE ME A BURIAL SITE AMONG YOU&#x2026;, AND THE HITTITES ANSWERED&#x2026;: HEAR US, MY LORD</small>, Ephron said to him: But which place do you want? He said to him: I want a place in your field. He said to him (in vs. 15): <small>&#x003C;WHAT IS&#x003E; A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER &#x003C;BETWEEN YOU AND ME</small>&#x003E;? Immediately (in vs. 16): <small>SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE MONEY FOR EPHRON</small> (&#x007B;&#x2019;<italic><small>PRWN</small></italic>&#x007D; [&#x2018;<italic><small>PRN</small></italic>]). The <italic>vav</italic> (&#x003D; <italic><small>W</small></italic>) is lacking (<italic>haser</italic>) &#x003C;from his name&#x003E; because he lusted to take Abraham&#x2019;s money. He did not know (from Prov. 28:22b) <small>THAT POVERTY</small> (<italic>heser</italic>) <small>WILL COME TO HIM</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22a): <small>&#x003C;AN EVIL-EYED PERSON &#x003E; MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>.</p>
<p>Whoever lends at interest lusts for money; (according to Prov. 28:22:) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>. The Holy One is angry with him and causes him to perish from the world. What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 22:23 [24])? <small>MY WRATH WILL BURN</small>&#x2026;. When? (Vs. 24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND TO MY PEOPLE</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:8): <small>THE ONE WHO AUGMENTS HIS WEALTH BY INTEREST</small>. How? &#x003C;When&#x003E; Israel wanted to borrow from him [and a foreigner wanted to borrow from him], he said: It is better for me to lend to a foreigner from whom I shall get usury. So he made him a loan. It is about him that Solomon cries out (in Prov. 28:8): <small>THE ONE WHO AUGMENTS HIS WEALTH</small> [<small>BY INTEREST AND USURY AMASSES IT FOR ONE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>]. Who is being <small>GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>? This is Esau. But is Esau <small>GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>? It is simply that, when the empire becomes jealous of him, it takes his money and with it provides for the needs of the many, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; paved roads<sup><xref rid="fn491">24</xref></sup> and public buildings.<sup><xref rid="fn492">25</xref></sup> Ergo (in Prov. 28:8): <small>&#x003C;HE&#x003E; AMASSES IT FOR ONE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>.</p>
<title>6.6 Exodus 22:24 [25]ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY &#x003C;TO MY PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Tanhuma opened on &#x003C;this verse with&#x003E; (Prov. 19:17): <small>THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn493">26</xref></sup> Whoever lends to the poor is, as it were, as if he were lending to the Holy One. (Ibid.:) <small>THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>, [<small>AND HE WILL REPAY HIM HIS DUE</small>]. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: What is the meaning of <small>AND HE WILL REPAY HIM HIS DUE</small>? The Holy One said: When a poor person&#x2019;s soul (<italic>nefesh</italic>) was seeking to leave,<sup><xref rid="fn494">27</xref></sup> you revived him. By your life I am returning you life (<italic>nefesh</italic>) for life. Tomorrow, when your son or daughter comes into the hands of guilt or into the hands of death, [this deed] will be remembered on their behalf, and I will give them a life for a life. The Holy One said: By your life, you have been named as the one who gave him a loan, as stated (in Prov. 19:17): <small>&#x003C;THE ONE WHO IS GENEROUS WITH THE POOR&#x003E; IS LENDING TO THE LORD</small>. You find that for all the sins which a person commits, the Holy One sits in judgment over him, saying: How did his judgment come about? In the case of one who steals, the Holy One sits over him in judgment, also over the one who commits adultery and over the one who commits &#x003C;any other &#x003E; transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn495">28</xref></sup> And so you find in the days of Ahab that Micah (i.e., Micaiah) said (in I Kings 22:19 or II Chron. 18:18):<sup><xref rid="fn496">29</xref></sup> <small>HEAR, THEREFORE, THE WORD OF THE LORD: I SAW THE LORD SITTING UPON HIS THRONE, AND ALL THE HEAVENLY HOST WAS STANDING BY HIM TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>. Is there a left above?<sup><xref rid="fn497">30</xref></sup> &#x003C;Yes,&#x003E; and is it not written (in Exod. 15:6): <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND, O LORD, &#x003C;GLORIOUS IN POWER, YOUR RIGHT HAND SHATTERS THE ENEMY</small>&#x003E;? It also says (in Ps. 118:16): <small>THE RIGHT HAND OF THE LORD IS EXALTED</small>&#x2026;. And it says here (in I Kings 22:19): <small>TO HIS RIGHT</small>&#x2026; What is the meaning of <small>TO HIS RIGHT AND TO HIS LEFT</small>? [Those on the right and those on the left.] The first group tilts the balance towards the scale of merit, and the other group tilts the balance towards the scale of guilt. So does the Holy One act towards all who commit &#x003C;any&#x003E; transgression. Their judgment is a matter of give and take. But in the case of one who has made a loan with interest, there is no give and take in his judgment. Instead &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; renders his judgment by himself. Thus the Holy One has said this to the ministering angels (in Ezek. 18:13): <small>WITH USURY HE HAS GIVEN</small>, &#x007B;<small>AND WITH INTEREST</small>&#x007D; <small>HE HAS TAKEN</small> [<small>INTEREST</small>]. <small>&#x003C;SHALL HE LIVE</small>?&#x003E; Immediately the ministering angels answer (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT LIVE. HE HAS COMMITTED ALL</small> [<small>THESE</small>] <small>ABOMINATIONS. HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Therefore Moses has said (in Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY TO MY PEOPLE</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</p>
<title>6.7 Exodus 22:24 [25]ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY &#x003C;TO MY PEOPLE, TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU, YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small>. &#x003E; What is the difference between a human act and an act of the Holy One? When someone human is in debt to a comrade, he says: Give me what you have on hand. He says to him: I have nothing now. They immediately have a quarrel and humiliate each other. But the Holy One is not like that. Thus you find that in the summer the day borrows from the night until the summer solstice.<sup><xref rid="fn498">31</xref></sup> Then from the summer solstice until the winter solstice the night borrows from the day. Where is it shown? &#x003C;Where&#x003E; David said (in Ps. 19:3 [2]): <small>ONE DAY POURS OUT SPEECH TO ANOTHER</small>. The former is lending to the latter and the latter is lending to the former; but no one hears what the difference is between them, as stated (in vs. 4 [3]): <small>THERE IS NO UTTERANCE; THERE ARE NO WORDS</small>&#x2026;. But when humans lend to each other, one hears quarreling. The Holy One said to Moses: Go and say to those Israelites: Although you lend to each other, you shall not treat &#x003C;the borrower &#x003E; with contempt.</p>
<title>6.8 Exodus 22:24 [25]ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>IF</small> [<small>YOU LEND</small>] <small>MONEY</small> [<small>TO MY PEOPLE</small>], <small>&#x003C;TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU, YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small> &#x003E;. You shall not say: &#x003C;The verse concerns only&#x003E; money. Rather &#x003C;it includes&#x003E; anything else which you might lend him.<sup><xref rid="fn499">32</xref></sup> <small>YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small>. So do not say: In the case of money, Torah says not to loan at interest, &#x003C;but&#x003E; I am making a loan to him with wheat.<sup><xref rid="fn500">33</xref></sup> Thus it is stated &#x003C;in this extended sense &#x003E; (in Exod. 22:24 [25]): <small>IF YOU LEND MONEY TO MY PEOPLE, TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU</small>. Therefore, one looks at a poor person as though he were <small>WITH YOU</small>. Hence our masters have said: In the case of a poor person who is in the market and a poor person [in your own courtyard], the one in the courtyard &#x003C; being nearer &#x003E; has precedence &#x003C;in receiving a loan&#x003E;. In the case of a poor person dwelling near you and one dwelling in another city, the poor person nearer you has precedence. (Exod. 22:24 [25]:) <small>&#x003C;IF YOU LEND MONEY</small>&#x2026;&#x003E; <small>TO THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU</small>, to that poor person who is <small>WITH YOU</small> and one of your own, <small>YOU SHALL NOT ACT TOWARD HIM AS A CREDITOR</small>. &#x003C;Do&#x003E; not &#x003C;think&#x003E;, because of what I told you (in Deut. 23:21 [20]): <small>FOR A FOREIGNER YOU MAY DEDUCT INTEREST</small>, &#x003C;that&#x003E; you shall lend to a foreigner and abandon Israel by saying: I am profiting from the foreigner. The Holy One has said: Know that I am the one who has made him poor and you rich. I can make you poor again.<sup><xref rid="fn501">34</xref></sup> Rav Nahman said: [See] what is written (in Deut. 15:10): <small>GIVE TO HIM READILY</small> [&#x2026;], <small>&#x003C;FOR BECAUSE OF THIS DEED THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL BLESS YOU</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn502">35</xref></sup> &#x201C;For the sake of (<italic>lema&#x2018;an)&#x201D;</italic> is not written here, &#x003C;but&#x003E; &#x007B;<small>IF</small>&#x007D; <small>BECAUSE OF THIS DEED</small>.

Tanhum ben Hanila&#x2019;i.<sup><xref rid="fn504">37</xref></sup> When he bought some meat, greens, or anything else for his house, he would say to the children of his household: Separate out for the poor their portion, for I have bought only one pound<sup><xref rid="fn505">38</xref></sup> for myself and a half pound for the poor. &#x003C;He did so&#x003E; because he was fulfilling (Eccl. 7:14): <small>IN THE DAY OF PROSPERITY BE PROSPEROUS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn506">39</xref></sup> <small>AND IN THE DAY OF ADVERSITY</small>, which comes upon others, <small>REFLECT</small>. Why? Because you are not far from poverty. He is close to you, (i.e., in Exod. 22:24 [25]) <small>THE POOR PERSON WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>6.9 Exodus 22:24 [25]ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 22:25 [26]:) <small>IF YOU EVER TAKE &#x003C;YOUR NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S&#x003E; GARMENT IN PLEDGE &#x003C; BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN YOU SHALL RESTORE IT TO HIM&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: How much you owe (<italic>hayyav</italic>) me&#x0021; You sin before me, but I am patient with you. Your soul comes up to me with every passing evening and renders account. Even though it is guilty (<italic>hayyav</italic>), I restore it to you, while you are in debt (<italic>hayyav</italic>) &#x003C;to me&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn507">40</xref></sup> So also with you (according to Exod. 22:25&#x2013;26 [26&#x2013;27]:), <small>BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN YOU SHALL RESTORE IT TO HIM, BECAUSE IT IS HIS ONLY COVERING&#x2026;. THEREFORE, WHEN HE CRIES OUT TO ME, &#x003C;I WILL PAY HEED, FOR I AM COMPASSIONATE</small> &#x003E;. Why? Because he is laying his complaint before me and saying: I am human, and he is human. He lies down upon his bed, but I have nothing upon which to lie down. <small>I WILL PAY HEED, FOR I A M COMPASSIONATE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world, when an individual has cried unto me, I have hearkened unto him; but in the world to come &#x003C;all of&#x003E; you shall cry unto me, and I will answer you immediately. The prophet has said (in Is. 30:19): <small>HE WILL SURELY SHOW YOU COMPASSION AT THE SOUND OF YOUR CRY. AS SOON AS HE HEARS IT, HE WILL ANSWER YOU</small>.</p>
<title>6.10 Exodus 23:20ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 23:20:) <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL &#x003C;BEFORE YOU TO GUARD YOU ON THE WAY&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Jer. 3:19): <small>THEN I SAID: HOW WOULD I</small><sup><xref rid="fn508">41</xref></sup> <small>PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>,&#x2026; &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn509">42</xref></sup> R. Eleazar ben Pedat says: What is this &#x003C;expression&#x003E;: <small>WOULD I PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>YOU</small>? It had occurred to me that we, I and you, would be &#x003C; alone &#x003E; in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn510">43</xref></sup> How did you manage for me to bring the peoples of the world in among you?<sup><xref rid="fn511">44</xref></sup> This expression is nothing but an expression of setting apart (as in Gen. 30:40): <small>AND HE PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>HIS OWN FLOCKS &#x003C;APART&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. R. Hama bar Hanina said: What is the meaning of <small>WOULD I PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>YOU</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn512">45</xref></sup> There was a great love between me and you.<sup><xref rid="fn513">46</xref></sup> How did you manage that I should hate you? (Jer. 3:19:) <small>HOW WOULD I PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>ShYT</italic></small>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; This expression is nothing but an expression of hatred, as used (in Gen. 3:15): <small>I WILL PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>ENMITY &#x003C;BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN</small>&#x003E;. Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19:) <small>HOW WOULD I PUT</small> (<small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small> &#x0021; R. Joshua ben Levi said: I spoke in &#x003C;your&#x003E; defense.<sup><xref rid="fn514">47</xref></sup> You behaved toward me so that I denounced you and pronounced you guilty (rt.: <small>HYB</small>). The expression (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) is nothing but an expression of guilt (rt.: <small>HYB</small>), as used (concerning one guilty of negligence in Exod. 21:30): <small>IF A RANSOM IS PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>UPON HIM, &#x003C;HE SHALL GIVE WHATEVER IS PUT</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>UPON HIM TO REDEEM HIS LIFE</small>&#x003E;. Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19:) <small>HOW WOULD I PUT</small> (<italic>ashit;</italic> rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>YT</small>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; R. Berekhyah the Priest said: You were as dear to me as someone who has a single field, which he fertilizes, cultivates, and weeds. So dear were you to me. Your behavior toward me was for you to commit lawlessness. Now this word (<italic>ashit</italic>) is nothing but an expression for lawlessness, as used (in Is. 5:6): <small>AND I WILL MAKE</small> (<italic>ashit</italic>) <small>IT</small> (i.e., the Holy One&#x2019;s vineyard) <small>A DESOLATION</small>. (Jer. 3:19, cont.:) <small>AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND</small>, a land that the great ones of the world (i.e., the patriarchs) desired.<sup><xref rid="fn515">48</xref></sup> Abraham said to the Hittites (in Gen. 23:4): <small>GIVE ME A BURIAL SITE</small>. The Holy One also endeared it to &#x007B;the children of&#x007D; Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 26:3): <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND, &#x003C;AND I WILL BE WITH YOU AND BLESS YOU</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. Jacob said (according to Gen. 50:5): <small>IN MY GRAVE WHICH I DUG FOR MYSELF &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, THERE YOU SHALL BURY ME</small>&#x003E;. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): <small>A DESIRABLE LAND</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>&#x003C;THE MOST</small>&#x003E; [<small>BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE</small>] <small>&#x003C;OF ALL THE NATIONS</small>&#x003E;. What is the meaning of <small>&#x003C;THE MOST&#x003E; BEAUTIFUL</small> (<italic>tsevi</italic>) <small>HERITAGE</small>? Just as in the case of a deer (<italic>tsevi</italic>), when one slaughters it, strips off its hide, and tries to return the flesh into the hide, it does not contain it, so the land of Israel does not contain its produce. What is written (in Is. 30:24)? <small>AS FOR THE OXEN AND ASSES THAT WORK THE GROUND, THEY SHALL EAT FERMENTED FODDER, WHICH HAS BEEN WINNOWED WITH SHOVEL AND PITCH FORK</small>. First they winnow with the <small>SHOVEL</small> and after that with the <small>PITCH FORK</small>. Why? Because there was more grain than straw. Even so there was produce in &#x003C;further&#x003E; winnowing the straw. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (ibid.): <small>FERMENTED MASH, WHICH HAS BEEN WINNOWED WITH SHOVEL AND PITCH FORK</small>. Mashes are from produce. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): [<small>A DESIRABLE LAND</small>,] <small>&#x003C;THE MOST&#x003E; BEAUTIFUL</small> (<italic>tsevi</italic>) <small>HERITAGE</small> (understood in the sense of <small>THE MOST DEERLIKE HERITAGE</small>), a land which does not contain its produce, a land which was so good that all the kings of the world desired it. It is written (in Josh. 12:9): <small>THE KING OF JERICHO, ONE; THE KING</small> &#x007B;<small>FOR AI</small>&#x007D; [<small>OF AI WHICH IS BESIDE BETHEL</small>], <small>ONE</small>. Now there are only three miles<sup><xref rid="fn516">49</xref></sup> between Jericho and Ai; yet it says: <small>THE KING OF JERICHO</small>. It is simply that whoever has a possession outside of the land without having a possession in the land of Israel was not called a king.<sup><xref rid="fn517">50</xref></sup> Why? Because they longed for the land of Israel. R. &#x007B;Isaac&#x007D; [Johanan] said: What is written (in Josh. 7:21): <small>I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS A &#x003C;FINE&#x003E; SHINAR MANTLE</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; a Babylonian<sup><xref rid="fn518">51</xref></sup> robe of royal purple,<sup><xref rid="fn519">52</xref></sup> which the king of Babylon wore to rule in Jericho. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): <small>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn520">53</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND I SAID YOU SHALL CALL ME FATHER</small>. Just as a father is obliged &#x003C;to provide &#x003E; for his daughter&#x2019;s enjoyments, so did I bring down rain for you. (Exod. 16:14:) <small>WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP, &#x003C;THERE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH LAY SOMETHING FINE AND FLAKY</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. (Jer. 3:20:) <small>SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER &#x003C;SO YOU HAVE BROKEN FAITH WITH ME, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>&#x003E;. R. Judah bar Simon said: Oh that &#x003C;you were&#x003E; like an unfaithful wife. This &#x003C;kind of&#x003E; a woman, who has a lover, gives him food, drink, and love. When his power is diminished, she leaves him and goes away. <small>SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER</small>. I have not done so to you. The manna came down for you, and the well rose up. I did not deprive you of anything when you were unfaithful with me. See, I gave you an angel who watched over you. (Exod. 23:20:) <small>SEE, I AM SENDING YOU AN ANGEL &#x003C;TO WATCH OVER YOU</small>&#x003E;. When you became worthy and received the Torah, I went before you in person. But now, when you have been found guilty, here I am &#x003C;merely&#x003E; (ibid.:) <small>SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU</small>. [Another interpretation:]<sup><xref rid="fn521">54</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Moses: I am sending &#x003C;an angel&#x003E; before you but not before them. He said: If you send &#x003C;him&#x003E; out before me, I do not want &#x003C;him&#x003E;; but Joshua saw the angel and fell down before him. What did he say to him (in Josh. 5:13)? <small>ARE YOU FOR US OR FOR OUR ADVERSARIES</small>? When he said to him: <small>ARE YOU FOR US</small>? he began to cry in great anguish.<sup><xref rid="fn522">55</xref></sup> (Ibid., vs. 14:) Then he said: <small>NO, BUT</small> <bold>[I]</bold> <small>AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD&#x2019;S HOST. NOW I HAVE COME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn523">56</xref></sup> Here are two times that I have come to give Israel an inheritance. I am the one who came in the days of your master, Moses; but he rejected me. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOW I HAVE COME. THEN JOSHUA FELL ON HIS FACE</small>. He saw him and fell on his face, but when Moses saw &#x003C;him&#x003E;, he rejected him. The Holy One said (in Exod. 23:20): <small>SEE, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU</small>, to you and to whomever observes the Torah [as you &#x003C;do&#x003E;. Resh Laqish said: It is written (in Ps. 91:4): <small>HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS AND YOU WILL FIND REFUGE UNDER HIS WINGS</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; all who observe the Torah.] (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HIS FIDELITY IS A SHIELD AND BUCKLER</small>. Therefore (in Exod. 23:20): &#x003C; <small>I AM SENDING MY ANGEL BEFORE YOU &#x003E; TO GUARD YOU ON THE WAY</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.11 Exodus 23:20ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Exod. 23:21:) <small>PAY HEED TO HIM, AND HEARKEN</small> (<small><italic>SM</italic></small>&#x2019;) <small>TO HIS VOICE. DO NOT REBEL AGAINST HIM, FOR HE WILL NOT PARDON YOUR TRANSGRESSION</small>. You were not worthy of hearing (rt.: <small><italic>SM</italic></small>&#x2019;) my voice. Hearken to (rt.: <small><italic>SM</italic></small>&#x2019;) the voice of an angel. He is unable to pardon your transgressions, because he is from the class who do not sin. Another interpretation (of Exod. 23:21:) <small>FOR HE WILL NOT PARDON YOUR TRANSGRESSION</small>. Why? Because he is an agent (<italic>sheliah</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn524">57</xref></sup> and whatever an agent is ordered to do, he does. But I lift up my face to you (i.e., show you favor), as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE &#x003C;UNTO YOU</small>&#x003E;. David said to him: Sovereign of the World, You have delivered me to your angel, one who does not lift up his face. Who can withstand him? (Ps. 130:3) <small>IF YOU, O LORD</small>, &#x007B;<small>LORD</small>&#x007D;, <small>KEEP ACCOUNT OF INIQUITIES, WHO WILL WITHSTAND</small>? &#x003C;Even&#x003E; if you say there is no forgiveness with you, it is with you, as stated in (vs. 4): <small>FOR WITH YOU THERE IS FORGIVENESS SO THAT YOU MAY BE FEARED</small>.</p>
<title>6.12 Exodus 23:20ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 23:21, cont.:) <small>FOR MY NAME IS WITH HIM</small>. The name of the Holy One is associated with each and every angel.<sup><xref rid="fn525">58</xref></sup> Moses said to him: I do not want an angel to go with us.<sup><xref rid="fn526">59</xref></sup> He said to him: If you &#x003C;yourself &#x003E; do not go with us, we are not moving from our place. The Holy One said to him: By your life, even though I will not send an angel before you, I will send the hornet before you, as stated (in Exod. 23:28): <small>I WILL SEND THE HORNET &#x003C; BEFORE YOU TO DRIVE OUT THE HEVITES, THE CANAANITES, AND THE HITTITES FROM BEFORE YOU</small>&#x003E;. How did the Amorites die? R. Levi said: He wedded two hornets to each and every one &#x003C;of them&#x003E;. Then when each and every hornet poured out its venom right into &#x003C;an Amorite&#x2019;s&#x003E; eyes, he died immediately. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: How did they die? A poison entered them, they &#x007B;became saturated&#x007D; [contracted diarrhea], and they died in the presence of Israel. R. Berekhyah said: The Holy One bound them before Israel. Then they came and killed them, as stated (in Deut. 3:3): <small>SO THE LORD OUR GOD GAVE OG, KING OF BASHAN, INTO OUR HANDS</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C;The Holy One acted&#x003E; like someone who binds his child&#x2019;s enemy and sets him before his child. In case you say the Amorites were small, the Holy One exalts them (in Amos 2:9): [<small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES BEFORE THEM</small>,] <small>WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT</small>. And what did I do to them? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I DESTROYED THEIR FRUIT ABOVE</small>, i.e., their prince; <small>AND THEIR ROOTS BELOW</small>, i.e., the &#x003C;rest of the&#x003E; Amorites. The Holy One said: In this world I sent an angel before them, and he destroyed the peoples of the world; but in the world to come, I am sending you Elijah, may his memory be blessed. It is so stated (in Mal. 3:24 [4:5]): <small>LO, I AM SENDING YOU THE PROPHET ELIJAH BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND AWESOME DAY OF THE LORD</small>.</p>

<title>7.1 Exodus 25:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 25:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>&#x2026;. <small>INSTRUCTION</small> (<small>LQH</small>) &#x003C;denotes&#x003E; my Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn527">1</xref></sup> &#x003C;It was&#x003E; customary for two traders<sup><xref rid="fn528">2</xref></sup> to be in the &#x003C;same&#x003E; district. One took in (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) raw silk,<sup><xref rid="fn529">3</xref></sup> and the other took in finished silk.<sup><xref rid="fn530">4</xref></sup> They stood side by side. One said to his companion: Do you want to make a change? He said: Yes. &#x003C;So&#x003E; they changed &#x003C;roles&#x003E; with each other. The first handed over the raw silk and took the finished silk for himself. It turned out that a single commodity &#x003C;remained&#x003E; in the hands of the one, and a single commodity &#x003C;remained&#x003E; in the hands of the other. But Torah is not like that. One learns the &#x003C;talmudic&#x003E; order, &#x201C;Seeds (<italic>Zera&#x2018;im</italic>),&#x201D; while another learns the order, &#x201C;Damages (<italic>Neziqin).&#x201D;</italic> Both of them stood side by side. One said to his companion: Teach me the order, &#x201C;Seeds,&#x201D; and I shall teach you the order, &#x201C;Damages.&#x201D; It turned out that the one had two &#x003C;orders&#x003E; in hand, and the other had two &#x003C; orders &#x003E; in hand. Is there &#x003C;any&#x003E; merchandise greater than this? Ergo (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Whoever acquires goods and takes to the road, is afraid of brigands,<sup><xref rid="fn531">5</xref></sup> but Torah is not like that. Can a brigand remove his Torah from the midst of his heart? Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &#x003C;I GAVE YOU&#x003E; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.</p>
<p>Our masters have told a story about a ship in which there were traders.<sup><xref rid="fn532">6</xref></sup> Now there was there a certain associate (<italic>haver</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn533">7</xref></sup> They said to him: What is your business?<sup><xref rid="fn534">8</xref></sup> He said to them: It is secret. They said to him: Why will you not reveal it to us? He said to them: When I enter the district, I will reveal it to you. They began to go over the ship; and when they did not find &#x003C;anything&#x003E;, they began to laugh at him. They only did so until the tax collectors dealt with them and took whatever they had on hand. They had nothing to eat and nothing to wear. That associate entered the synagogue and began to sit and expound to them (the people). They began to honor him and to provide for him. Those who were with him in the ship began to come to him and seek &#x003C; assistance &#x003E; from him. They said to him, If you please, because you know us, plead our cause. What caused him to be saved? The Torah, which was in his heart. Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &#x003C;I GAVE YOU &#x003E; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &#x003C;I GAVE YOU &#x003E; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>. Whenever someone borrows from the children of Adam, acquires goods, and takes to the road, at times they are lost; but the Torah is not like this.<sup><xref rid="fn535">9</xref></sup> Rather, when one learns one chapter from here and another chapter from there, he is supported by them. Ergo: (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR &#x003C;I GAVE YOU&#x003E; GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.</p>
<title>7.2 Exodus 25:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 25:2:) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.] The Holy One said to them: The Torah was mine, and you undertook them (the commandments).<sup><xref rid="fn536">10</xref></sup> Take me along with it. (Ibid.:) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <small>LQH</small>) <small>ME AS A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn537">11</xref></sup> Resh Laqish said: Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ter</italic>. 1:1): <small>THERE ARE FIVE WHO DO NOT SEPARATE OUT THE PRIESTLY SHARE; AND IF THEY DO SEPARATE IT OUT, THEIR PRIESTLY SHARE IS NOT A &#x003C; VALID &#x003E; PRIESTLY SHARE. &#x003C;THE FIVE ARE &#x003E; THE DEAF, THE INSANE, THE MINOR, ONE WHO SEPARATES OUT A PRIESTLY SHARE WHICH IS NOT HIS OWN, AND A FOREIGNER WHO SEPARATES OUT A PRIESTLY SHARE FROM WHAT BELONGS TO ISRAEL. [EVEN IF IT IS WITH PERMISSION], HIS PRIESTLY SHARE IS NOT A &#x003C; VALID &#x003E; PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Now all of them are derived from this verse (i.e., Exod. 25:2): <small>&#x003C;SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE; YOU SHALL TAKE MY PRIESTLY OFFERING FROM EVERY PERSON WHOSE HEART MOVES HIM</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn538">12</xref></sup> <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>: A deaf person is exempt because he does not hear. <small>WHOSE HEART MOVES HIM</small>: An insane person is exempt because his heart is not being moved. <small>FROM EVERY PERSON</small>: The minor is exempt because he is not a &#x003C;grown&#x003E;person (<italic>ish</italic>). Also one who separates out what is not his, as stated (ibid.): <small>FROM EVERY PERSON</small>, i.e., from what belongs to them. Also the foreigner who separates out a priestly share of what belongs to Israel, even with permission, as stated (ibid.): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, is exempt because he is not from Israel.</p>
<title>7.3 Exodus 25:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 25:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003C;AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>&#x003E;. It is not written here: &#x201C;And let them take a priestly share,&#x201D; but <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>) <small>A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Anything about which <italic>li</italic> (&#x201C;to me&#x201D; or &#x201C;for me&#x201D;) is used, &#x003C;belongs to the Holy One&#x003E; in this world and in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn539">13</xref></sup> (Lev. 25:23:) <small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY, FOR</small> [<small>THE LAND]</small> <small>BELONGS TO ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>), in this world and in the world to come. [(Numb. 8:17:) <small>FOR EVERY FIRST-BORN AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BELONGS TO ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>), in this world and in the world to come. (Numb. 8:14:) <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BELONG TO ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>), in this world and in the world to come.] So also the priestly share &#x003C;belongs to the Holy One&#x003E; in this world and in the world to come.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>) <small>A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. Every offering concerning which <italic>li</italic> (&#x201C;to me&#x201D;) is used contains a blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn540">14</xref></sup> The priestly share contains a blessing. R. Johanan said: Israel brought everything for working on the Tabernacle on two mornings.<sup><xref rid="fn541">15</xref></sup> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Exod. 36:3): <small>AND THEY STILL BROUGHT FREEWILL OFFERINGS UNTO HIM IN THE MORNING, IN THE MORNING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn542">16</xref></sup> So a blessing was given in the priestly share of the Tabernacle. (Exod. 25:2) <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>.] The Holy One said to them: I am not bothering with &#x003C;any&#x003E; other people except you. What is written (in Hab. 2:4)? <small>LO, HIS INNER SOUL IS ARROGANT, NOT UPRIGHT; BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITHFULNESS. LO, &#x003C;HIS INNER SOUL&#x003E; IS ARROGANT</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar. How? The Holy One had made him king over all the world but he was unhappy with his lot. (Ibid.:) <small>HIS INNER SOUL IS &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; NOT UPRIGHT</small>. Then he looked at himself and felt ashamed;<sup><xref rid="fn543">17</xref></sup> but he said: I am king. Thus it says: <small>HIS INNER SOUL IS &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; NOT UPRIGHT</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITHFULNESS</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small>MN</small>). In the world to come the Holy One will judge the children of Adam, each and every one along with the children of his handiwork (rt.: &#x2018;<small>MN</small>); <small>BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE</small> with fidelity (rt.: &#x2018;<small>MN</small>). The Holy One said to them: Each and every one &#x007B;is from&#x007D; [lives off] his handiwork (rt.: &#x2018;<small>MN</small>). Now I have redeemed you from Egypt, but you are not setting aside for me a priestly share. (Exod. 25:2): <small>AND LET THEM TAKE FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>7.4 Exodus 25:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 25:3&#x2013;7:) <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE THAT YOU SHALL TAKE FROM THEM</small>: <small>&#x003C;GOLD, SILVER, AND BRONZE; &#x003E; BLUE, PURPLE, &#x003C;AND SCARLET YARNS; FINE LINEN, GOAT HAIR, REDDENED&#x003E; RAM SKINS, DOLPHIN SKINS, AND ACACIA WOOD;&#x003E; OIL FOR LIGHTING, &#x003C;SPICE FOR ANOINTING OIL AND FOR AROMATIC INCENSE, ONYX STONES</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. R. Judah bar Simon said: &#x003C;The Holy One said to Israel:&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn544">18</xref></sup> Do not think that you are repaying me thirteen things<sup><xref rid="fn545">19</xref></sup> which correspond to thirteen things which I set aside for you in Egypt. These were the following (according to Ezek. 16:10&#x2013;12, 19): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERY, SHOD YOU WITH DOLPHIN SKIN, WRAPPED YOU IN FINE LINEN, COVERED YOU WITH SILK, ADORNED YOU WITH JEWELS, PUT BRACELETS ON YOUR ARMS, AND A CHAIN AROUND YOUR NECK; I PUT A RING ON YOUR NOSE, EARRINGS ON YOUR EARS, AND A SPLENDID CROWN UPON YOUR HEAD&#x2026;. AND MY BREAD WHICH I GAVE YOU, &#x003C; BREAD &#x003E; OF FINE FLOUR, OIL, AND HONEY, &#x003C;THIS BREAD&#x003E; I GAVE YOU TO EAT</small>. Ergo, the thirteen things which you have set aside for me correspond to (but do not repay) the thirteen things which I set aside for you in Egypt. In the age to come I am repaying you these corresponding thirteen things, those which are mentioned (in Is. 4:5&#x2013;6): <small>FOR THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE</small> [<small>WHOLE]</small> <small>SITE OF MOUNT ZION &#x003C;AND OVER ITS ASSEMBLY A CLOUD AND SMOKE BY DAY AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. <small>AND THERE SHALL BE A SUKKAH AS A SHADE FROM THE HEAT BY DAY</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>7.5 Exodus 25:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:3, 5:) <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE,&#x2026;, SKINS OF TEHASHIM</small> (i.e., <small>DOLPHINS</small>),&#x2026;. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ.<sup><xref rid="fn546">20</xref></sup> R. Judah says: &#x003C;There was&#x003E; a large wild beast in the desert, which they took and from which they made hangings. R. Nehemiah said: It was a miracle; for at the time it was created, it was hidden away.</p>
<title>7.6 Exodus 25:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 25:3): <small>AND THIS IS THE PRIESTLY SHARE</small>&#x2026;: [<small>GOLD, SILVER, AND BRONZE]</small>. <small>GOLD</small> corresponds to the kingdom of Babylon, concerning which is written (in Dan. 2:38): <small>YOU</small> (Nebuchadnezzar) <small>ARE THE HEAD OF GOLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn547">21</xref></sup> <small>SILVER</small>: This denotes the kingdom of Media, concerning which is written (in Esth. 3:9): <small>THREE THOUSAND TALENTS OF SILVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn548">22</xref></sup> <small>AND BRONZE</small>: This denotes the kingdom of Greece, which was the least of them all. (Exod. 25:5:) <small>REDDENED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small>DM</small>) <small>RAM SKINS</small>. This denotes the kingdom of Edom, as stated (in Gen. 25:25): <small>THE FIRST</small> (i.e., Esau) <small>CAME FORTH RUDDY</small> (rt: &#x2018;<small>DM</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn549">23</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Although you have seen these four kingdoms exalting over you, by your life, I am producing salvation for you out of the midst of slavery. What is written next (in Exod. 25:6)? <small>OIL FOR LIGHTING</small> (<italic>ma&#x2019;or</italic>). What is the meaning of <small>LIGHTING</small>? This denotes the Messianic (<italic>Mashiah</italic>) King, as stated (in Ps. 132:17): <small>THERE I WILL MAKE A HORN SPROUT FOR DAVID</small>; [<small>I HAVE PREPARED A LAMP FOR MY ANOINTED ONE</small> (<italic>Mashiah</italic>)].<sup><xref rid="fn550">24</xref></sup> When Daniel saw these [four] kingdoms, he was afraid. It is so stated (in Dan. 7:15): <small>AS FOR ME, DANIEL, MY SPIRIT WAS DISTURBED &#x003C;WITHIN ME; AND THE VISION OF MY HEAD ALARMED ME</small>&#x003E;. What did Daniel see? It is simply that, when Nebuchadnezzar saw the dream, Daniel came and interpreted it for him. He said to him (in Dan. 2:38): <small>YOU</small> (Nebuchadnezzar) <small>ARE THE HEAD OF GOLD</small>. (Dan. 2:32:) <small>&#x003C;THE HEAD OF THAT STATUE WAS OF FINE GOLD;&#x003E; ITS BREAST AND ITS ARMS WERE OF SILVER</small>. This &#x003C;silver&#x003E; denotes the kingdom of Babylon.<sup><xref rid="fn551">25</xref></sup> (Dan. 2:39:) <small>BUT ANOTHER KINGDOM SHALL ARISE AFTER YOU, INFERIOR TO YOU</small>. (Dan. 2:32:) <small>ITS BELLY AND ITS THIGHS WERE OF BRONZE</small>. This denotes the kingdom of Media. (Dan. 2:39, cont.:) <small>THEN YET A THIRD KINGDOM, ONE OF BRONZE, WHICH SHALL RULE OVER THE WHOLE EARTH</small>. (Dan. 2:33:) <small>ITS LEGS WERE OF IRON</small>. This denotes the kingdom of Greece. (Dan. 2:40, 42:) <small>BUT THE FOURTH KINGDOM SHALL BE AS STRONG AS IRON&#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; &#x007B;AND ITS&#x007D; [THE] FEET</small><sup><xref rid="fn552">26</xref></sup> <small>WERE PARTLY &#x007B;OF&#x007D; IRON AND PARTLY &#x007B;OF&#x007D; CLAY</small>. This is Edom. Why was it likened to iron and clay? Our masters have said: This wicked kingdom is going to use clay coinage.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why was it likened to iron and clay? Just as iron is hard, so is this wicked kingdom hard. And why is it like clay? Because the Holy One is going to break it like clay, as stated (in Is. 30:14): <small>HE SHALL BREAK IT AS A POTTER&#x2019;S VESSEL IS BROKEN</small>&#x2026;. Now &#x003C; Daniel &#x003E; had seen the Messianic King, as stated (in Dan. 2:34): <small>YOU LOOKED ON UNTIL A STONE WAS CUT OUT WITHOUT THE USE OF HANDS</small>&#x2026;. Resh Laqish said: This &#x003C;stone&#x003E; is the Messianic King. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN IT STRUCK THE STATUE ON ITS FEET</small>, &#x003C;i.e., struck&#x003E; all the kingdoms, which were set in the statue. Now by virtue of what is the Messianic King likened to a stone (<italic>even</italic>)? By virtue of Jacob, &#x003C; of whom &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn553">27</xref></sup> it is stated (in Gen. 49:24): <small>FROM THERE &#x003C;COMES&#x003E; THE SHEPHERD, THE ROCK</small> (<italic>even</italic>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small><sup><xref rid="fn554">28</xref></sup> (Dan. 2:45:) &#x003C; <small>BECAUSE YOU SAW&#x003E; THAT A ROCK</small> (<italic>even</italic>) <small>WAS CUT FROM THE MOUNTAIN</small>, so that it consumes the whole world, as stated (in Is. 11:4): <small>AND HE SHALL SMITE THE EARTH WITH THE ROD OF HIS MOUTH</small>. In that hour Israel shall dwell in tranquillity and security, as stated (in Ezek. 28:26:) <small>AND THEY SHALL DWELL ON IT</small> (their own soil) <small>IN SECURITY</small>.</p>
<title>7.7 Exodus 26:7ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 26:7:) <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF GOATS</small>&#x2019; <small>HAIR &#x003C;FOR A TENT OVER THE TABERNACLE</small>;&#x003E;&#x2026;. This text is related (to Mal. 1:2): <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU, SAYS THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn555">29</xref></sup> Who spoke this verse? Malachi spoke it. When? When he rebuked Israel. Malachi said to them (in Mal. 3:8): <small>WOULD ANYONE ROB GOD</small>? <small>&#x003C;YET YOU ARE ROBBING ME</small>.&#x003E; They answered him (ibid., cont.): <small>HOW ARE WE ROBBING YOU</small>? Our masters have said of the generation of Malachi: He rebuked them, and they answered him. He said to them (ibid.): <small>WOULD ANYONE ROB</small> (<italic><small>QB</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>GOD</small>? R. Levi said: That (i.e., <italic><small>QB</small></italic>&#x2019;) is an Arabic word.<sup><xref rid="fn556">30</xref></sup> When an Arab comes to talk with his companion &#x003C;and&#x003E; says to him: Are you stealing (<italic><small>GNB</small></italic>) from us? &#x003C;he says:&#x003E; Are you robbing (<italic><small>QB</small></italic>&#x2019;) us? (Ibid.:) <small>WOULD ANYONE ROB</small> (<italic><small>QB</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>GOD</small>. Then he said (ibid., cont.): <small>BUT YOU SAY: HOW ARE WE ROBBING YOU? IN THE TITHE AND THE PRIESTLY SHARE</small>, because they are not collecting them properly. Again he said to them (in Mal. 1:2): <small>IS NOT ESAU JACOB&#x2019;S BROTHER</small>? And you say (ibid.): <small>HOW HAVE YOU LOVED US</small>? By universal custom, when someone has two sons, one first-born and one younger, who receives the most? The first-born. Esau came out &#x003C; of the womb&#x003E; first, as stated (in Gen. 25:25): <small>THE FIRST</small> (i.e., Esau) <small>CAME FORTH RUDDY</small>. It was proper for him to receive two shares, but I did not act in this way. Instead Jacob received two shares, this world and the world to come. Esau said so to Jacob (in Gen. 33:12): <small>LET US GO ON OUR JOURNEY</small>&#x2026;. Let both of us walk in the world &#x003C;together&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn557">31</xref></sup> Jacob said to him: Take your world and go away. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 33:14): <small>PLEASE LET MY LORD GO AWAY</small>&#x2026;, <small>UNTIL I COME TO MY LORD IN SEIR</small>. R. Jacob said: I went through all the Scripture &#x003C;to see&#x003E; whether Jacob did or did not go to Seir, and I found no &#x003C; indication that he did so&#x003E;. Then when is he going &#x003C;there&#x003E;? In the Age to come, as stated (in Obad., vs. 21): <small>FOR SAVIORS SHALL GO UP ON MOUNT ZION &#x003C;TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU</small>,&#x003E;&#x2026;. Therefore (in Mal. 1:2): <small>YET I HAVE LOVED JACOB</small>. Jacob is a partner with Esau in this world; &#x007B;I &#x003C;am a&#x003E; &#x007D; [but Esau is no] partner with Jacob in the world to come. Solomon said (in Prov. 5:17): <small>LET IT BE FOR YOU ALONE AND NOT FOR STRANGERS ALONG WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>7.8 Exodus 26:7ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Mal. 1:2:) <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU, SAYS THE LORD</small>. See how he has cherished you. From the earth to the sky is a journey of five hundred years.<sup><xref rid="fn558">32</xref></sup> And likewise from the first sky to the second, from the second to the third, from the third to the fourth, from the fourth to the fifth, from the fifth to the sixth, and from the sixth to the seventh. Now it is unnecessary to calculate from the hoofs of the beasts (in Ezek. 1:5&#x2013;13),<sup><xref rid="fn559">33</xref></sup> but the throne is above all of them. See how I cherished you&#x0021; &#x003C;I loved you so much&#x003E; that I forsook<sup><xref rid="fn560">34</xref></sup> them all and said to you: Make me tent sheets of goats&#x2019; hair, and I will come to dwell with you. R. Joshua ben Levi said: If the peoples of the world had known how good the Tabernacle was for them,<sup><xref rid="fn561">35</xref></sup> they would have surrounded it with encampments and fortifications.<sup><xref rid="fn562">36</xref></sup> Why? Before the Tabernacle was erected, the divine word went forth and entered into the midst of the tents belonging to the peoples of the world. Then they were seized with panic, since it is stated (in Deut. 5:23 [26]): <small>FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH THAT HAS HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LIVING GOD FROM THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED</small>? You heard it and are alive, but the peoples of the world heard it and were seized with panic in the midst of their tents. And you should not only say &#x003C; this &#x003E; about the Tabernacle, but even the Temple was good for them. Where is it shown? That is what Solomon ordained in his prayer (in I Kings 8:41, 43 // II Chron. 6:32, 33): <small>AND LIKEWISE, &#x003C;WHEN&#x003E; THE FOREIGNER, WHO IS NOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, &#x003C;COMES FROM A FAR COUNTRY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR NAME&#x003E;&#x2026;, MAY YOU HEARKEN UNTO &#x003C;HIM IN YOUR&#x003E; HEAVENLY &#x003C;ABODE</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn563">37</xref></sup> But when Israel came to worship, what does he say (in vs. 39)? <small>AND GIVE TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO</small> [<small>ALL]</small> <small>HIS WAYS, SINCE YOU KNOW HIS HEART</small>&#x2026;. Yet in the case of the foreigner, whether they do or do not do &#x003C;what is right &#x003E;, give him whatever he asks, (according to vs. 43, cont.) <small>SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH</small> [<small>MAY KNOW]</small> <small>&#x003C;YOUR NAME</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. Therefore, the Temple was good for the peoples of the world. [R. Samuel bar Nahman said: Before the Temple was built, the world rested upon a throne<sup><xref rid="fn564">38</xref></sup> of two legs; but since the Temple has been built, the world is firmly established<sup><xref rid="fn565">39</xref></sup> and stands in its place. And you should not &#x003C;only&#x003E; say: The Temple. Even the Tabernacle was good for the peoples of the world.] Therefore the Holy One said to Moses: Make me a tabernacle (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>KN</small>), because I desire to dwell (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>KN</small>) with my children. When the ministering angels heard that, they said to him: Sovereign of the World, why are you leaving heavenly beings and descending to earthly beings? Your glory is that you &#x003C;dwell&#x003E; in the heavens, <small>YOU WHO</small> (according to Ps. 8:2 [1]) <small>HAVE SET YOUR MAJESTY OVER THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One said to them: By your lives, I am doing just as you said. Habakkuk said (in Hab. 3:3): <small>GOD IS COMING FROM TEMAN</small>. Then afterwards (in the same verse): <small>AND THE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS PRAISE</small>. The Holy One said to them: Now how are you surprised over this? Look at how I cherish the earthly beings, so as to descend and dwell under tent sheets of goats&#x2019; hair. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 26:7): <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF GOATS</small>&#x2019; <small>HAIR</small>.</p>
<title>7.9 Exodus 26:7ff., Part III</title>
<p>R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ.<sup><xref rid="fn566">40</xref></sup> R. Judah says: A large, clean beast was in the desert, and out of it they made tent sheets. R. Nehemiah says: It was a miracle. It was created for a time and hidden away. You yourself know that it is written (in Exod. 26:7&#x2013;8): <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF &#x003C;GOATS</small>&#x2019; <small>HAIR FOR A TENT OVER THE TABERNACLE</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. <small>THE LENGTH OF EACH TENT SHEET SHALL BE THIRTY CUBITS</small>&#x2026;.. Who brings you tent sheets of thirty &#x003C;cubits&#x003E;? Hence you learn according to the words of R. Nehemiah that it was a miracle. [And you should not only say so concerning the tent sheeting, but there was even a miracle concerning the boards.] Where did the boards come from?<sup><xref rid="fn567">41</xref></sup> Our father Jacob planted them when he went down to Egypt. He said to his children: My children, you are going to be redeemed from here; and after you are redeemed, the Holy One is going to say to you: Make me a tabernacle. Just arise and plant cedars. When he tells you to make a tabernacle, the cedars will be available in your hands. Immediately they did as their father told them. They arose and planted cedars.</p>
<p>Our masters have said (concerning Exod. 26:28): <small>THE CENTER BAR &#x003C; THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE BOARDS</small> &#x003E; came down to Egypt at the hands of Jacob, the one which served &#x003C;as a bolt&#x003E; <small>FROM END TO END</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn568">42</xref></sup> It did not do so without the cedars uttering<sup><xref rid="fn569">43</xref></sup> a song, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; that which David utters (in I Chron. 16:33 // Ps. 96:12): <small>THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>SHALL ALL FOREST TREES SHOUT FOR JOY. THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) is nothing but a song which one utters to the Holy One<sup><xref rid="fn570">44</xref></sup> and says: When will the Tabernacle be made? Now when the Holy One said [to Moses] that he should make the Tabernacle, what did he say to him (in Exod. 26:15)? <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE THE BOARDS INTO A TABERNACLE &#x003C;OF ACACIA WOOD</small>&#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn571">45</xref></sup> the same boards which their father (Jacob) had prepared for them. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: There were twenty-four kinds of cedar; but from all of them, only seven were chosen.<sup><xref rid="fn572">46</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Is. 41:19): <small>IN THE WILDERNESS I WILL PLANT THE CEDAR, THE ACACIA, THE MYRTLE, AND THE OLIVE; IN THE DESERT I WILL SET THE CYPRESS, THE PLANE TREE, AND THE ELM TOGETHER</small>. Cypress is silver fir;<sup><xref rid="fn573">47</xref></sup> plane is maple;<sup><xref rid="fn574">48</xref></sup> elm is boxwood,<sup><xref rid="fn575">49</xref></sup> which is more approved than all species of cedar. But of them all, none was selected except the acacia alone. [It is so stated] (in Exod. 26:15): <small>&#x003C;AND YOU SHALL MAKE THE BOARDS FOR THE TABERNACLE&#x003E; OF ACACIA</small> (<italic>shittim</italic>) <small>WOOD</small>. And why did he call it <italic>shittim</italic>? Simply in order to heal what Israel did in Shittim (Numb. 25:1&#x2013;9). Another interpretation (of Exod. 26:15): <small>ACACIA</small> (<italic>shittim</italic>) <small>WOOD</small>. They sinned in Shittim, and they were stricken in Shittim. They sinned in Shittim (according to Numb. 25:1): <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM, &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB</small>&#x003E;. And they were stricken in shittim (according to Numb. 25:9): <small>AND THOSE WHO DIED FROM THE PLAGUE WERE &#x003C;TWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND</small> &#x003E;. Moreover, they did not move from there until they were healed. Phinehas arose and turned back the wrath from them, as stated (in vs. 11): <small>PHINEHAS BEN ELEAZAR &#x003C;BEN AARON THE PRIEST HAS TURNED AROUND MY WRATH FROM UPON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. The Holy One said: In the world to come I will heal the shittim, as stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE, THE HILLS SHALL RUN WITH MILK, AND</small> [<small>ALL]</small> <small>THE WATERCOURSES OF JUDAH SHALL RUN WITH WATER. THEN A SPRING SHALL ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHALL WATER THE WADI OF THE ACACIAS</small> (<italic>shittim</italic>).</p>

<title>8.1 Exodus 27:20ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 27:20:) <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Cant. 1:15): <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED</small>&#x2026;. R. Aqiva said: All of the whole world and its fullness was not as worthy as the day on which the Torah of Song of Songs was given to Israel; for while all of the writings are holy, the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy.<sup><xref rid="fn576">1</xref></sup> R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who took a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of wheat and gave it to a baker. He said to him: Take from it so much fine flour, so much crushed grain, so much bran. Similarly all the Writings are holy, but the Song of Songs is the holiest of the holy. Rabbi said: See how the Holy One praises the assembly of Israel in it (i.e., in Cant. 1:15). <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED. AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in works.<sup><xref rid="fn577">2</xref></sup> <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the work of your ancestors. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the house. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the field. In the house (according to Deut. 6:9): <small>UPON THE DOORPOSTS OF YOUR HOUSE</small>. In the field through priestly shares, tithes, gleaning the forgotten sheaf (of Deut. 24:19), and through the <italic>pe&#x2019;ah</italic> (of Lev. 19:9). (Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> on the roof (according to Deut. 22:8): <small>YOU SHALL MAKE A PARAPET FOR YOUR ROOF</small>. (Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in this world. <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL</small> in the world to come.</p>
<p>(Cant. 1:15:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED</small>. R. Simon ben Pazzi said: She praises him in a simple expression, and he praises her with a double expression. Why does he praise her with a double expression?<sup><xref rid="fn578">3</xref></sup> Because if she does not do his will, he can exchange her for another. But she praises him in simple language because she cannot exchange him for another. (Cant. 1:16:) <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY DEAR, LOVELY INDEED</small>. Therefore (in Cant. 1:15): <small>AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED; AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>. These (eyes) are the Sanhedrin.<sup><xref rid="fn579">4</xref></sup> Just as the whole body follows the eyes, so Israel follows the Sanhedrin. Whatever they (of the Sanhedrin) declare unclean is unclean; &#x003C; whatever they declare &#x003E; clean is clean. (Ibid.:) <small>WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>. Just as in the case of a dove: When all birds are being slaughtered, they move convulsively;<sup><xref rid="fn580">5</xref></sup> but the dove does not do so. Instead it stretches out its neck. So no one gives his life for the sake of the Holy One except Israel, as stated (in Ps. 44:23 [22]): <small>INDEED, FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE SLAIN ALL DAY LONG</small>; [<small>WE ARE REGARDED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED</small>.] (Cant. 4:1:) <small>&#x003C;AH, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, MY BELOVED, WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES&#x003E; BEHIND THE VEIL</small>. In the case of a woman, when the hair of her head grows, she puts the hair behind it (i.e., the veil); and it is becoming to her. So in the case of Israel, when their Sanhedrin sat in the chamber of hewn stones, it was confined behind your veil.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 1:15): <small>WITH YOUR DOVELIKE EYES</small>. R. Isaac said: The Holy One said to them: Your appearance (<italic>deigma</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn581">6</xref></sup> resembles a dove.<sup><xref rid="fn582">7</xref></sup> Whoever wants to buy wheat says to his comrade: Show me its appearance (<italic>deigma</italic>). Also in your case, your appearance (<italic>deigma</italic>) resembles a dove. How? When Noah was in the ark, what is written (in Gen. 8:8 &#x0026; 11)? <small>THEN HE SENT OUT THE DOVE</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND</small> [<small>THE DOVE</small>] <small>CAME TO HIM TOWARD EVENING</small>. The Holy One said to them: Just as the dove brought light to the world, you also, who were likened to the dove, brought olive oil and burned it before me, as stated (in Exod. 27:20): <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF BEATEN OLIVES &#x003C; FOR THE LIGHT</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E;</p>
<title>8.2. Exodus 27:20ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 27:20:) <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Cant. 7:6 [5]): <small>YOUR HEAD UPON YOU IS LIKE CARMEL, &#x003C;AND THE LOCKS</small> (<italic>dallah</italic>) <small>OF YOUR HEAD</small> (<italic>rosh</italic>) <small>ARE LIKE PURPLE</small>&#x003E;. The poor (<italic>dallim</italic>) and the needy (<italic>rashim</italic>) who are among you are as dear to me as Daniel.<sup><xref rid="fn583">8</xref></sup> [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>A KING IS CAPTIVATED BY THE TRESSES</small> (<italic>rehatim</italic>).] The Holy One, as it were, said to them: I am bound &#x003C;by an oath&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn584">9</xref></sup> to be among you. By virtue of what? By virtue of the races that Abraham ran for me, as stated (in Gen. 18:6&#x2013;7): <small>ABRAHAM HASTENED TO THE TENT &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn585">10</xref></sup> Ergo (in Cant. 7:6 [5]): <small>A KING IS CAPTIVATED BY THE TRESSES</small> (<italic>rehatim</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn586">11</xref></sup> R. Levi said: By virtue of Jacob, of whom it is written (in Gen. 30:38): &#x003C; <small>AND HE SET UP THE RODS WHICH HE HAD PEELED&#x003E; IN THE TROUGHS</small> (rehatim), <small>IN THE WATER RECEPTACLES</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 7:6 [5]): <small>A KING IS CAPTIVATED BY THE TRESSES</small> (<italic>rehatim</italic>). The Holy One said to Moses: Moses, I have made you a king. Just as the king issues decrees, and they act; so you issue decrees<sup><xref rid="fn587">12</xref></sup> over them, and they shall act. (Exod. 27:20:) <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.3 Exodus 27:20ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 27:20:) <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E; TO BRING UNTO YOU</small> [<small>CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN&#x003E; OLIVES</small>]. Why neither nut oil nor radish oil but oil of olives? Because olive oil is light for the world.</p>
<p>(Exod. 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF</small> [<small>BEATEN</small>] <small>OLIVES</small>. By universal custom, if one has bad oil, he burns it in a lamp; but the good &#x003C;oil&#x003E; he puts in cooked food. In the Temple, however, they do not do so. Rather they put clear olive oil into the lamp, and that which is second (in quality)<sup><xref rid="fn588">13</xref></sup> they put into the meal offering. David said (in II Sam. 22:29): <small>FOR YOU ARE MY LAMP, O LORD</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.4 Exodus 27:20ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 27:20): <small>AND YOU SHALL COMMAND &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF BEATEN OLIVES FOR THE LIGHT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;, not because I need light but in order to give you light. R. Johanan said: The eye is white with black in the middle.<sup><xref rid="fn589">14</xref></sup> From where must it see? Not from the white? But that is not so. One only sees from the midst of the black. Now you are not able to comprehend the light of the eyes; yet you seek to comprehend my ways. Is it not because your &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive misleads you, saying: Perhaps he (the Holy One) needs light? R. Abbin the Levite said: &#x007B;You desire that whoever wants&#x007D; [You find that whoever desires] to make windows for himself, makes them wider on the inside and narrower on the outside. Why? So that they will attract the light. But the windows of the Temple were wider on the outside and narrower on the inside.<sup><xref rid="fn590">15</xref></sup> Why? So that the light would go forth from the Temple and light up the world. The light goes forth from the midst of my house; so do I have need of light? But you may say: Why does he need a lamp? In order to give us light. (Exod. 27:20:) <small>TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF BEATEN OLIVES</small>&#x2026;, in order to light up an eternal lamp so that your light may be constantly before me. David said (in Ps. 97:11:) <small>LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.</p>
<title>8.5 Exodus 27:20ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 27:21:) <small>IN THE TENT OF MEETING OUTSIDE THE VEIL &#x003C;&#x2026; AARON AND HIS SONS SHALL SET IT</small> (the lamp) <small>UP</small>&#x003E;. Lest your &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive mislead you, saying: He needs light, see what is written (ibid.): <small>OUTSIDE THE VEIL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn591">16</xref></sup> The <italic>menorah</italic> only needed to be put inside of the veil with the ark, but it was put <small>OUTSIDE THE VEIL</small> in order to inform you that he does not need a light. Why did he tell you &#x003C;to set it up&#x003E;? Because you are worthy of the light. Another interpretation: By universal custom, &#x003C;when&#x003E; a king of flesh and blood makes himself a couch and table, he sets the <italic>menorah</italic> to his left; but it was not like this in the Temple. Instead the <italic>menorah</italic> was placed to the right of the table in order to inform you that he does not need a lamp of yours. Why did he tell you &#x003C;to set it up&#x003E;? To give you light in the world to come, when darkness shall come upon the peoples of the world, as stated (in Is. 60:2): <small>FOR BEHOLD DARKNESS SHALL COVER THE EARTH, AND THICK CLOUDS THE PEOPLES. THEN THE LORD WILL SHINE UPON YOU AND HIS GLORY WILL APPEAR OVER YOU</small>.</p>
<title>8.6 Exodus 27:20ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN&#x003E; OLIVES</small>. You find that whoever is put in the darkness sees whatever is in the light, and whoever is put in the light does not see whatever is in the darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn592">17</xref></sup> However, the Holy One sees whatever is in the darkness and whatever is in the light. Daniel said (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE REVEALS THE DEEP AND SECRET THINGS; HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM</small>. R. Judah bar Il&#x2019;ay said: The sun is put in the midst of his bosom, as stated (in Ps. 19:5 [4]): <small>HE PLACED IN THEM</small> (i.e., in the heavens) <small>A TENT FOR THE SUN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn593">18</xref></sup> At the summer solstice (June 21) it goes forth from the midst of his bosom to ripen the fruit, but the world cannot withstand it. Why? Because it is &#x003C;too&#x003E; strong on account of its light. The Holy One said. Since you cannot look at &#x003C;this light that is&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn594">19</xref></sup> a &#x003C;mere&#x003E; creation of mine, do I have need for a light of yours?<sup><xref rid="fn595">20</xref></sup> Then why did I tell you &#x003C;to set up the <italic>menorah</italic>&#x003E;? For the world to come.</p>
<p>(Exod. 27:20): <small>OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN &#x003E; OLIVES</small>. How did they make the oil? Our teachers have taught: The olive trees which bore good fruit were known to them. They took them and crushed them. When the first oil came forth, they set it aside for the <italic>menorah</italic>. The second after that was for the oblations, to fulfill what is stated (in 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF BEATEN OLIVES FOR THE LIGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn596">21</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you were under obligation to the light of the Temple; but in the world to come, on the merit of that lamp, I will bring you the Messianic (<italic>Mashiah</italic>) King who is compared to a lamp, as stated (in Ps. 132:17): <small>THERE WILL I MAKE A HORN SPROUT FOR DAVID</small>; [<small>I HAVE PREPARED A LAMP FOR MY ANOINTED ONE</small> (<italic>Mashiah</italic>)].<sup><xref rid="fn597">22</xref></sup> And not only that but I am making a light for you, just as Isaiah has said (in Is. 60:19): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT, YOUR GOD &#x003C;SHALL BE&#x003E; YOUR GLORY</small>.</p>
<title>8.7 Exodus 29:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 29:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE THING WHICH YOU SHALL DO TO THEM &#x003C;TO SANCTIFY THEM FOR SERVING ME AS PRIESTS</small> &#x003E;. This text is related (to Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn598">23</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE AWAY SHAME</small>. These are the peoples of the world. Now when did<sup><xref rid="fn599">24</xref></sup> Israel inherit the glory? When they received the Torah from Sinai. R. Johanan said: Sixty myriads of ministering angels descended with the Holy One to Sinai, and they put crowns on the head of each and every one from Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn600">25</xref></sup> R. Abba bar Kahana said: When Israel stood at Mount Sinai and said (in Exod. 24:7): <small>WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small>, the Holy One immediately loved them and gave two angels to each and every one of them. The one girded on his armor (<italic>zayin</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn601">26</xref></sup> and the other set a crown for him on his head. R. Simon said: They clothed them in purple,<sup><xref rid="fn602">27</xref></sup> as stated (in Ezek. 16:10): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERED GARMENTS</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: They gave them implements of war (<italic>zayin</italic>) with the Ineffable Name engraved thereon.<sup><xref rid="fn603">28</xref></sup> Ergo (in Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are the Israelites, because they received the Torah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE AWAY SHAME</small>. These are the peoples of the world. The Holy One put them to shame. R. Samuel said: (Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are David and Solomon, who built the Temple. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE AWAY SHAME</small>. These are the peoples of the world who destroyed it. The Holy One puts them to shame. R. Nahman said: See what is written (in Ps. 73:20): <small>O LORD, IN THE CITY</small><sup><xref rid="fn604">29</xref></sup> <small>YOU DESPISE THEIR IMAGE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn605">30</xref></sup> Why <small>IN THE CITY</small>? The proverb is simply saying: In the place where the robber<sup><xref rid="fn606">31</xref></sup> commits robbery, there he is hung. For that reason <small>IN THE CITY</small> is written.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are Moses and Aaron. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE AWAY SHAME</small>. These are Dathan and Abiram.<sup><xref rid="fn607">32</xref></sup> Why? When manna descended for Israel, Moses said (in Exod. 16:19&#x2013;20): <small>LET NO ONE LEAVE ANY OF IT UNTIL MORNING. BUT THEY DID NOT HEED MOSES</small>, [<small>AND CERTAIN PEOPLE LEFT SOME OF IT UNTIL MORNING</small>. And who were they: They were Dathan and Abiram.] R. Levi said: A colony<sup><xref rid="fn608">33</xref></sup> of worms came out of their tents.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are Aaron and his children, because the priesthood was established<sup><xref rid="fn609">34</xref></sup> in their hands, according to the saying (in Exod. 29:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE THING WHICH YOU SHALL DO TO THEM TO SANCTIFY THEM &#x003C;FOR SERVING ME AS PRIESTS &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>8.8 Exodus 29:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 29:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE THING</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Ps. 119:89): <small>FOREVER, O LORD, DOES YOUR WORD STAND FIRM IN THE HEAVENS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn610">35</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah the Priest said: From time immemorial you have treated us with the measure of mercy.<sup><xref rid="fn611">36</xref></sup> When? When our father Abraham was cast into the fiery furnace, the angels quarreled with each other.<sup><xref rid="fn612">37</xref></sup> Michael said: I am going down to rescue him,<sup><xref rid="fn613">38</xref></sup> but Gabriel said: I am going down and rescue him.<sup><xref rid="fn614">39</xref></sup> The Holy One said: I am going down in my glory to rescue him, as stated (in Gen. 15:7): <small>I AM THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM UR OF THE CHALDEES</small>&#x2026;. He said to them (the angels): You shall rescue his children&#x2019;s children. When Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah descended into the fiery furnace, the angel went down to rescue them.<sup><xref rid="fn615">40</xref></sup> Then the angels said (in Ps. 119:89&#x2013;90): <small>FOREVER, O LORD, DOES YOUR WORD STAND FIRM IN THE HEAVENS</small>&#x2026;. <small>YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED THE EARTH AND IT STANDS FIRM</small>. You are the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 119:90): <small>AND YOU STAND FIRM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn616">41</xref></sup> You stand firm by your word. By which word? By the word which you spoke to Aaron, that you would establish<sup><xref rid="fn617">42</xref></sup> the priesthood by his hand.</p>
<title>8.9 Exodus 29:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 29:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE THING WHICH YOU SHALL DO TO THEM</small>. To them you shall do it and not to others.<sup><xref rid="fn618">43</xref></sup> He began to teach them how they would keep &#x003C;themselves&#x003E; in a state of purity and eat the sacrifices, how they would immerse and eat the priestly share. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO SANCTIFY THEM FOR SERVING ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>) <small>AS PRIESTS</small>. R. Mani said in the name of R. Eliezer: Wherever <small>TO ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>) is stated, &#x003C;it means&#x003E; &#x201C;forever and forevermore.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn619">44</xref></sup> The first-born &#x003C; remains &#x003E; forever, since it is stated (in Numb. 3:13 &#x003D; 8:17): <small>FOR ALL THE FIRST-BORN ARE MINE</small> (<italic>li</italic>). Silver and gold &#x003C;remain&#x003E; forever, since it is stated (in Hag. 2:8): <small>THE SILVER IS MINE</small> (<italic>li</italic>), <small>AND THE GOLD IS MINE</small> (<italic>li</italic>). The kingship &#x003C;remains&#x003E; forever, since it is stated (in I Sam. 16:1): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN A KING FOR MYSELF</small> (<italic>li</italic>) <small>AMONG HIS</small> (Jesse&#x2019;s) <small>SONS</small>. The land &#x003C;remains&#x003E; forever, since it is stated (in Lev. 25:23): <small>FOR THE LAND BELONGS TO ME</small> (<italic>li</italic>).

<title>8.10 Exodus 29:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 29:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE THING WHICH YOU SHALL DO TO THEM&#x2026;: TAKE A YOUNG BULL OF THE HERD</small>, &#x003C;acquired&#x003E; through purchase and not from plunder.<sup><xref rid="fn620">45</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND TWO RAMS &#x003C;WITHOUT BLEMISH</small>&#x003E;, a ram on either side and the bull in the middle. Why three &#x003C; animals &#x003E;? To correspond to the three glories of the world (i.e., the patriarchs). The bull corresponds to Abraham (in Gen. 18:7): <small>THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD</small>. (Exod. 29:1): <small>AND TWO RAMS</small> [<small>WITHOUT BLEMISH</small>]. &#x003C;These&#x003E; [correspond to] Isaac and Jacob. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALSO UNLEAVENED BREAD</small>. By their merit I will bless their bread. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: When the offerings used to be brought, an Arbelian <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> &#x003C;of wheat&#x003E; produced a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of fine flour, a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of regular flour, a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of coarser meal,<sup><xref rid="fn621">46</xref></sup> a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of coarse bran, &#x003C;and&#x003E; a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of variegated flour; but now one brings a <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> of wheat to grind and only takes away as much as he brought plus a little extra.<sup><xref rid="fn622">47</xref></sup> Why? Because the shewbread has ceased. See how the offerings which were offered upon the altar were beneficial for them&#x0021; For whatever was offered from a species blessed that species. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: Even the establishment of an altar was done only for the atonement of Israel. Why was it named an altar (<small>MZBH</small>)? M, because it pardons (<italic>mohel</italic>) the sins of Israel; Z, because it is a good memorial (<italic>zikkaron</italic>) for Israel; B, because it is a blessing (<italic>berekhah</italic>) for Israel; &#x003C;and&#x003E; H, because it is life (<italic>hayyim</italic>) for Israel. The unleavened bread and the shewbread blessed the bread, and the first fruits blessed the fruit of the tree. &#x003C;There is&#x003E; a story about R. Johanan ben Eleazar, who dwelt under a fig tree; and the fig tree was full of beautiful figs. A dew came down and the figs absorbed honey. The wind kneaded them with the dust. A certain goat came and dripped milk in the honey. Then he called his students and said to them: Come and see an example<sup><xref rid="fn623">48</xref></sup> resembling the world to come. And why all this? Because the offerings were brought &#x003C;to the altar&#x003E;. &#x003C;There is&#x003E; a story about a certain scribe, who went up to Jerusalem each and every year. Now the people of Jerusalem knew him to be mighty in the Torah. They said to him: Take fifty gold coins each and every year and dwell with us. He said to them: I have one vine which is for me the most beautiful of them all, and it bears me three crops<sup><xref rid="fn624">49</xref></sup> in each year. So it bears six hundred barrels in each year. The first bears three hundred; the second, two hundred; and the third, one hundred. So I sell them at a very dear price, but all this gain is &#x003C;attributable&#x003E; to Jerusalem, on account of the libation of wine which they offer. When they abrogated it, all these good things were withheld. So you find that, when Israel was exiled to Babylon, Ezra said to them: Go up to the land of Israel. But they were unwilling. The Holy One said: When you offered the shewbread, you sowed little and brought in much. Now, however, (as in Hag. 1:6) <small>YOU HAVE SOWN MUCH AND BROUGHT IN LITTLE; YOU EAT WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn625">50</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU DRINK WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>, ever since the libation of wine has ceased,<sup><xref rid="fn626">51</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON CLOTHES, WITHOUT BEING WARM</small>, ever since they abrogated the vestments of priesthood. The prophet has said (in Hab. 3:17): <small>FOR THE FIG TREE SHALL NOT BLOSSOM</small>, ever since they abrogated the first fruits. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THERE IS NO YIELD ON THE VINES</small>, ever since they abrogated the drink offerings. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WORK OF THE OLIVE HAS FAILED</small>, ever since they abrogated the oil of olives for the light. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND FIELDS OF GRAIN PRODUCE NO FOOD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND FIELDS OF GRAIN</small> (<small>W<italic>Sh</italic>DMWT</small>)? <small>AND FIELDS OF CATTLE</small> (<small>W<italic>Sh</italic>DY BHMWT</small>). &#x003C;Therefore, <small>THE FIELDS PRODUCE NO CATTLE</small> &#x003E;, ever since they abrogated the &#x003C; commandments pertaining to&#x003E; firstlings. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE FLOCK HAS BEEN CUT OFF FROM THE FOLD</small>, ever since they have abrogated the daily sacrifices. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THERE IS NO HERD IN THE STALLS</small>, ever since they abrogated the bulls &#x003C;which they offered&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn627">52</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said (in Sot. 9:12): <small>SINCE THE DAY THAT THE TEMPLE WAS DESTROYED THERE HAS BEEN NO DAY IN WHICH THERE WAS NO CURSE</small>. It is so stated (in Ps. 7:12 [11]): <small>AND GOD IS ANGRY EVERY DAY</small>. In the world to come, however, the Holy One will restore the blessings which &#x003C;the land&#x003E; had acquired, as stated (in Ezek. 36:8): <small>BUT YOU, O MOUNTAINS OF ISRAEL, SHALL BRING FORTH YOUR BRANCHES AND RAISE UP YOUR FRUIT FOR MY PEOPLE ISRAEL, BECAUSE THEY ARE SOON TO COME</small>.</p>

<title>9.1 Exodus 30:11ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 30:12:) <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS</small> (<italic>rosh</italic>) <small>OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL. LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. &#x003C;The verse&#x003E; is speaking of Israel&#x2019;s Sanhedrin, since it was located in the center of the Temple in the Chamber of Hewn Stones, which resembles a navel.<sup><xref rid="fn628">1</xref></sup> As the navel is located in the middle of the body, so was the Sanhedrin located in the middle of the Temple.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>NAVEL</small>. As in the case of the navel, all the time that the infant is located in its mother&#x2019;s abdomen, the navel &#x003C; coming &#x003E; from it is a life&#x003C;line&#x003E;; so Israel draws its life from the Sanhedrin. Therefore, there is a resemblance between the Sanhedrin and a navel. What is the meaning of <small>ROUND BOWL</small> (literally: <small>BOWL OF ROUNDNESS</small> [<italic>sahar</italic>])? <italic>A patera</italic><sup><xref rid="fn629">2</xref></sup> used in business.<sup><xref rid="fn630">3</xref></sup> &#x007B;The <small>ROUNDNESS</small> (<italic>sahar</italic>) is like the merchant (<italic>soher</italic>).&#x007D; Whatever is needed comes out of it (i.e., round bowl). Now this expression (<small>ROUND BOWL</small>, i.e., <italic>aggan ha-sahar</italic>) can only be a word for <italic>patera</italic>, as stated (in Exod. 24:6): <small>AND MOSES TOOK HALF THE BLOOD AND PUT IT IN BOWLS</small> (<italic>agganot</italic>). Another interpretation (of Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL</small>. Abbin bar Bar Hisda said: What is the meaning of <small>ROUND BOWL</small> (<italic>aggan ha-sahar)?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn631">4</xref></sup> It is like the half moon, since they call the moon roundness (<italic>sihra</italic> in Aramaic).<sup><xref rid="fn632">5</xref></sup> &#x003C;Ergo:&#x003E; <small>ROUND BOWL</small>, &#x003C;i.e. the moon&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn633">6</xref></sup> Our masters have said (in <italic>Sanh</italic> 4:3): <small>THE SANHEDRIN WAS &#x003C;ARRANGED&#x003E; LIKE HALF OF A ROUND THRESHING FLOOR</small>. (Cant. 7:3 [2], cont.:) <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>, since there is never less than one-third of them. In the case of mixed wine, whoever mixes it properly mixes a third of a cup of wine with two parts water. So the Sanhedrin would sit from the &#x003C;time of &#x003E; the morning sacrifice until the sacrifice at twilight, so that none of them was free for &#x003C;heeding nature&#x2019;s&#x003E; necessities. Then what did they do when one of them wanted to leave? He would count. If there were twenty-three, he would leave; but if not, he would not leave. Thus it is written (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>; and there was never less than one third of them. Ergo (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>.</p>
<title>9.2 Exodus 30:11ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Cant. 7:3 [2], cont.:) <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. R. Johanan said: <small>A HEAP OF WHEAT</small> (<italic>hittim</italic>, sing.: <italic>hittah):</italic> This is the book of Leviticus, all of which &#x003C;concerns&#x003E; sin offerings (<italic>hatta&#x2019;ot</italic>, sing.: <italic>hatta&#x2019;ah</italic>) and guilt offerings (<italic>asamot</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn634">7</xref></sup> It is &#x003C;the law of&#x003E; the sin offering (<italic>hitta;</italic> cf. Lev. 6:18 [25]). It is &#x003C;the law of&#x003E; the guilt offering (<italic>asham;</italic> cf. Lev. 7:1). Moreover, &#x003C;like the belly in the middle of the body,&#x003E; it (i.e., Leviticus) is set in the middle of Torah, and all of it &#x003C;concerns&#x003E; sin offerings (i.e., the wheat of Cant. 7:3 [2]) and guilt offerings. Ergo (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY</small> (i.e., Leviticus) <small>IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small> (i.e.., sin offerings). Resh Laqish said: Why is it likened to wheat? It is simply that just as all of these wheat grains are reckoned by measure, so all of Israel was reckoned by number (<italic>minyan</italic>). The elders, the saints, the sages, and all Israel are reckoned by number (<italic>minyan</italic>).</p>
<p>(Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. Rav Idi said: But is not a heap of pine cones<sup><xref rid="fn635">8</xref></sup> more beautiful than one of wheat?<sup><xref rid="fn636">9</xref></sup> Yet it says (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. It is simply that the world cannot subsist on pine cones but can subsist on wheat. It is therefore written (in Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>R. Isaac said: No one reckons baskets of refuse, of chaff, or of straw to his steward.<sup><xref rid="fn637">10</xref></sup> What does he reckon to his steward? Baskets of wheat, not baskets of refuse. What does he do &#x003C;with the refuse&#x003E;? He cleans (rt.: <small>MHH</small>) it out with water, even as &#x003C;he did to&#x003E; the generation of the flood (according to Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT</small> (rt.: <small>MHH</small>) <small>OUT &#x003C;THE HUMANITY WHICH I CREATED &#x003E;</small>. And not baskets of chaff. Now what does he do? He scatters it to the wind, even as &#x003C;he did to&#x003E; the generation of the dispersion (according to Gen. 11:8): <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM</small>. Likewise the bundles of straw. Now what does he do? He puts them in the furnace, even as he did to the Egyptians (according to Exod. 15:7): <small>IT CONSUMES THEM LIKE STRAW</small>. [So what did his steward reckon? The bundles of wheat. Thus Israel is likened to wheat. He therefore counts them (in Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE &#x003C;A CENSUS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E;]</p>
<title>9.3 Exodus 30:11ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE &#x003C;A CENSUS</small>&#x003E;.] This text is related to Ps. 3:3 [2]): <small>MANY SAY TO MY SOUL</small>&#x2026;.. This refers to David, when that deed (of II Sam. 11) took place at his hand.<sup><xref rid="fn638">11</xref></sup> They said: What person is there who has carried off the ewe lamb, killed the shepherd, and made Israel fall by the sword?<sup><xref rid="fn639">12</xref></sup> Is there salvation for him? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR HIM THROUGH HIS GOD</small>. David said (in vs. 3 [2]): <small>AND YOU, O LORD</small>, have concurred with them and have written in the Torah (at Lev. 20:10): <small>THE ADULTERER AND THE ADULTERESS SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Still (according to Ps. 3:4 [3]) <small>&#x003C;YOU, O LORD, ARE&#x003E; A SHIELD ABOUT ME</small>. You &#x003C;are the one&#x003E; who shielded me through the merit of my ancestors, &#x003C;the one&#x003E; who restored me to the kingship, <small>AND</small> (ibid. cont.:) <small>THE ONE WHO RAISES UP MY HEAD</small>. Instead of that which I owed you, &#x003C; namely &#x003E; the lifting off of the head, you gave me an uplifted head at the hands of the prophet Nathan, [who said to me] (in II Sam. 12:13): <small>THE LORD HAS ALSO REMITTED YOUR SIN; YOU SHALL NOT DIE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: David spoke with respect to the event of the &#x003C;golden&#x003E; calf. The world said: This is the people who heard from the mouth of its God (in Exod. 20:3): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO &#x003C;OTHER GODS BESIDE ME&#x003E;</small>. Then at the end of forty days they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. Is there salvation for them? (Ps. 3:3 [2]:) <small>&#x003C;MANY SAY TO MY SOUL&#x003E;: THERE IS NO SALVATION FOR HIM THROUGH HIS GOD. SELAH</small>. &#x003C;The word&#x003E; <small>MANY</small> (in Ps. 3:3 [2]) can only mean the peoples of the world, since it is stated (in Is. 17:12): <small>HERE IS THE ROAR OF MANY PEOPLES</small>. Israel had promised (to have no other gods) and you agreed with them; so you said to Moses our Teacher (in Deut. 9:14): <small>LET ME ALONE, AND I WILL DESTROY THEM</small>. However, (in Ps. 3:4 [3]:) <small>&#x003C;YOU, O LORD ARE&#x003E; A SHIELD ABOUT ME</small>. You &#x003C;are the one&#x003E; who shielded me through the merit of our ancestors and recalled for us the merit of Abraham, in that you had said to him (in Gen. 15:1): <small>I AM A SHIELD FOR YOU</small>. Before I committed that &#x003C; sinful &#x003E; act, you had your Divine Presence dwell in our midst, but after I had committed that act, you said (in Exod. 25:8): <small>AND MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &#x003C;THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM</small>&#x003E;. (Ps. 3:4 [3]): <small>THE ONE WHO RAISES UP MY HEAD</small>. Instead of that which we owed you, &#x003C;namely&#x003E; the lifting off of our head, you gave us an uplifted head at the hands of Moses our Teacher, [to whom you said] (in Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF</small> (literally: <small>LIFT UP THE HEAD OF</small>) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;.&#x003E;</p>
<title>9.4 Exodus 30:11ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS</small>.] What is written &#x003C;just&#x003E; before this lection (in Exod. 30:10)? <small>AARON SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT UPON ITS HORNS</small> (i.e., the horns of the incense altar) <small>&#x003C;ONCE A YEAR</small>&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn640">13</xref></sup> When Israel sinned, the Holy One said to Moses: Go and make atonement for them. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, did you not say this: <small>ONCE A YEAR</small>? The Holy One said to him: Go and restore them. R. Abbin the Levite said: Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, out of all the peoples that you have in your world, you only charge me concerning Israel. (Lev. 20:2:) <small>AND UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL YOU SHALL SAY</small>. (Exod. 30:31:) <small>UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL YOU SHALL SPEAK</small>. To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn641">14</xref></sup> To a King who had purple garments.<sup><xref rid="fn642">15</xref></sup> Now he had a certain purple cloak which he cherished more than all of them. So he commanded his servant and said to him: Shake it out; fold it up. He also said to him: Set your mind on it. He said to him: My Lord King, of all your purple garments you have only commanded me concerning this one. He said to him: Because I wore this one when I first became king, I therefore cherish it more than all these &#x003C;other&#x003E; garments of mine. In such a way did the Holy One speak, when &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; said to him: For what reason did you command me more concerning Israel than all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; peoples which are in the world? He said to him: For what reason? Because they were the first to make me king, &#x003C;when they did so&#x003E; by the sea. (Exod. 15:18:) <small>THE LORD SHALL REIGN FOR EVER AND EVER</small>.</p>
<title>9.5 Exodus 30:11ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE &#x003C;A CENSUS</small>&#x003E;. R. Joshua bar Nahmani the Priest said: The Holy One said to Moses: Go and number Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn643">16</xref></sup> Moses said to the Holy One: It is written (in Gen. 28:14): <small>AND YOUR SEED SHALL BE LIKE THE DUST OF THE EARTH</small>&#x2026;; (and in Hos. 2:1 [1:10]): <small>THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA</small>&#x2026;. So are you saying: Go and number Israel&#x0021; Moses said to the Holy One: I am unable to hold out in counting them. The Holy One said to him: Moses, it is not as you think. However, if you wish to hold out in counting Israel, take the initial letters of the tribes. Then you shall hold out in counting them. &#x003C;Take&#x003E; the <italic>resh</italic> from Reuben, the shin from Simeon, the <italic>lamed</italic> from Levi, etc., for each and every tribe. To what is the matter comparable? To a money-changer who had a boy. He said to him: Count these coins for me. He said to him: How can I count them? He said to him: count the tops of the stacks of coins, and you will hold out in the calculation. So when Moses met with difficulties in the calculation of Israel, the Holy One said to him: Take the initial letters of the tribes, and you shall hold out in their calculation. The <italic>resh</italic> of Reuben equals two hundred thousand;<sup><xref rid="fn644">17</xref></sup> the <italic>nun</italic> of Naphtali equals fifty thousand; the shin of Simeon equals three hundred thousand; the <italic>yod</italic> of Judah &#x003C;plus&#x003E; the <italic>yod</italic> of Joseph &#x003C;plus&#x003E; the <italic>yod</italic> of Issachar equal thirty thousand; the <italic>zayin</italic> of Zebulun equals seven thousand; the <italic>dalet</italic> of Dan equals four thousand; the <italic>gimel</italic> of Gad equals three thousand; the <italic>bet</italic> of Benjamin equals two thousand; the <italic>alef</italic> of Asher equals one thousand. The result is five hundred ninety-seven thousand. Where are the three thousand (from the original six hundred thousand of Exod. 12:37)? These were the ones who fell in the days of the &#x003C;golden&#x003E; calf, as stated (in Exod. 32:28): <small>SO THE CHILDREN OF LEVI ACTED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES, AND ABOUT THREE THOUSAND OF THE PEOPLE FELL ON THAT DAY</small>. For that reason the Holy One said to Moses: Number Israel in order to know how many are missing.</p>
<title>9.6 Exodus 30:11ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Exod. 30:12): <small>WHEN YOU TAKE A CENSUS &#x003C;&#x2026;, EACH SHALL GIVE A RANSOM FOR HIS LIFE&#x2026;,&#x003E; SO THAT NO PLAGUE COME UPON THEM</small>. When Moses heard this, he was afraid, and said (as Job. 2:4): <small>SKIN FOR SKIN</small>&#x0021; <small>ALL THAT ONE HAS HE WILL GIVE FOR HIS LIFE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn645">18</xref></sup> R. Judah b. R. Il&#x2019;ay said: Moses said: We have already found that a ransom for a person&#x2019;s life is a talent of silver. It is so stated (in I Kings 20:39): <small>IT WILL BE YOUR LIFE FOR HIS LIFE OR YOU WILL PAY A TALENT</small> [<small>OF SILVER</small>]. R. Johanan said: From whom did he learn &#x003C;about the ransom &#x003E;? From the one who commits libel. Thus it is stated (concerning the man who commits libel against his virgin bride in Deut. 22:19): <small>AND THEY SHALL FINE HIM A HUNDRED &#x003C;SHEKELS OF&#x003E; SILVER</small>. Now we have committed libel against the Holy One<sup><xref rid="fn646">19</xref></sup> and said (of the golden calf in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;Therefore,&#x003E; each and every one of us must give a hundred &#x003C;shekels&#x003E; of silver. Resh Laqish said: Moses learned &#x003C;about the ransom&#x003E; from &#x003C;the law concerning &#x003E; the rapist. It is written (concerning the rapist in Deut. 22:29): <small>THE MAN WHO LAY WITH HER SHALL GIVE</small> [<small>TO THE YOUNG WOMAN&#x2019;S FATHER FIFTY &#x003C;SHEKELS OF&#x003E; SILVER</small>]. Now we have raped the &#x003C;divine&#x003E; word. Thus it is written (in Exod. 20:3): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO</small> [<small>OTHER GODS</small>] <small>&#x003C;BESIDES ME</small>&#x003E;; and we have committed idolatry. &#x003C;Therefore,&#x003E; each and every one of us must give fifty &#x003C; shekels of&#x003E; silver. R. Judah bar Simon said: Moses learned from &#x003C;the law concerning&#x003E; a goring bull, since it is stated (in Exod. 21:32): <small>IF A BULL GORES A MALE</small> [<small>OR FEMALE</small>] <small>SLAVE</small>, [<small>HE SHALL GIVE THIRTY SHEKELS OF SILVER TO THE MASTER</small>]. Now we have exchanged his glory for a bull. It is so stated (in Ps. 106:20): <small>THUS THEY EXCHANGED THEIR GLORY FOR THE IMAGE OF A BULL</small>. Does every one of us have to give thirty shekels? The Holy One knew what was in Moses&#x2019; heart. He said to him: By your life, &#x003C;the ransom will be&#x003E; not a talent of silver, not a hundred &#x003C; shekels of&#x003E; silver, not fifty shekels of silver, and not thirty shekels, but (as in Exod. 30:13): <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED IN THE RECORDS &#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS: &#x003C;A HALF SHEKEL &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>9.7 Exodus 30:11ff., Part VII</title>
<p>[(Exod. 30:13:) <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED IN THE RECORDS&#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS</small> (<small>ZH</small>): <small>&#x003C;A HALF SHEKEL</small>&#x003E;.] R. Meir said: The Holy One took something like a coin of fire<sup><xref rid="fn647">20</xref></sup> from under the throne of glory and showed it unto Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn648">21</xref></sup> Then he said to Moses <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED</small> (<italic>ha&#x2019;over</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) <small>IN THE RECORDS &#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS</small>. Moses said: Who shall give? The Holy One said to him: Everyone who crossed over (<italic>ha&#x2019;over</italic>) in the sea.</p>
<p>(Exod. 30:13:) <small>A HALF SHEKEL</small>. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ. R. Judah says: Because (in the matter of the calf) they sinned in the middle of the day, they would give the half shekel. But R. Nehemiah said: Because they sinned for six hours in the day, they would give the half shekel,<sup><xref rid="fn649">22</xref></sup> since it consists of six <italic>grammata</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn650">23</xref></sup> R. Judah bar Nehemiah said in the name of R.

Berekhyah said in the name of Resh Laqish: You sold Rachel&#x2019;s first-born for twenty &#x003C;pieces of&#x003E; silver (according to Gen. 37:28); therefore, in the case of every first-born that you shall have, his redemption shall be five shekels of silver, as stated (in Numb. 3:47): <small>YOU SHALL TAKE FIVE &#x003C;SHEKELS&#x003E; EACH</small>.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 30:13:) <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE WHO IS ENTERED IN THE RECORDS&#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS</small> (<small>ZH</small>). How many tribes should give? <italic>Z</italic> (<italic>zayin</italic>) equals seven &#x003C;and&#x003E; <italic>H</italic> (<italic>he</italic>) equals five for a total of twelve tribes.</p>

<p>The Holy One said: [in this world] the children of Adam count you. In the world to come, however, I will count them; and there is no one who will number you.

(Exod. 31:18:) <small>AS UNTO HIS BRIDE</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn660">33</xref></sup> <small>HE THEN GAVE UNTO MOSES</small>.</p>
<title>9.12 Exodus 31:18ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Exod. 31:18:) <small>WHEN HE HAD FINISHED &#x003C;SPEAKING WITH HIM ON MOUNT SINAI,&#x003E; HE THEN GAVE UNTO MOSES &#x003C;THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY</small>&#x003E;.] R. Abbahu said: The whole forty days that Moses spent on high, he was learning Torah and forgetting it.<sup><xref rid="fn661">34</xref></sup> Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, here I have &#x003C;spent&#x003E; forty days, and I do not know anything&#x0021; What did the Holy One do when he had completed the forty days? He gave him the Torah as a gift. <small>HE THEN GAVE UNTO MOSES</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 31:18, cont.:) <small>THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY</small> correspond to heaven and earth, to groom and bride, to the two wedding attendants, to this world and the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn662">35</xref></sup> Ergo: <small>THE TWO TABLETS OF THE TESTIMONY</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 31:18, cont.:) <small>TABLETS OF STONE</small> (<italic>even</italic>), &#x003C;were given&#x003E; by virtue of Jacob, of whom it is written (in Gen. 49:24): <small>FROM THERE &#x003C;COMES&#x003E; THE SHEPHERD, THE ROCK</small> (<italic>even</italic>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Exod. 32:16): <small>THE TABLETS WERE THE WORK OF GOD</small>. On each and every day a heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) comes forth from Mount Horeb and says: Woe to those people for their disregard of Torah. Thus, whoever is not busy with Torah is proclaimed &#x003C;to be&#x003E; under rebuke.<sup><xref rid="fn664">37</xref></sup> [Thus it is stated] (ibid.): <small>&#x003C;THE TABLETS WERE&#x003E; THE WORK OF GOD</small>, in that they were the handiwork of the Holy One.</p>
<p>(Exod. 32:16, cont.:) <small>INSCRIBED ON THE TABLETS</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>INSCRIBED</small> (<small>HRWT</small>)? R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and our masters disagree. R. Judah says: Freedom (<small>HYRWT</small>) from the empires;<sup><xref rid="fn665">38</xref></sup> R. Nehemiah says: Freedom from the angel of death; but our masters have said: Freedom from tribulations.</p>
<title>9.13 Exodus 31:18ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Exod. 32:1:) <small>WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW THAT MOSES WAS LATE &#x003C;IN COMING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN</small> &#x003E;. What is the meaning of <small>WAS LATE</small> (<italic>boshesh</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn666">39</xref></sup> &#x003C;That&#x003E; six (<italic>shesh</italic>) hours had passed (<italic>bo</italic>) without Moses having come down, for Moses had made an agreement with them and said to them: After forty days I will bring you the Law. As soon as six hours had passed and he had not come down, immediately (ibid., cont.): <small>THE PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST AARON</small>. Our masters have said: Satan came, confounded the world,<sup><xref rid="fn667">40</xref></sup> and showed them something like Moses suspended from the earth, i.e., in the air<sup><xref rid="fn668">41</xref></sup> beneath it.<sup><xref rid="fn669">42</xref></sup> Then they pointed a finger at him and said (ibid., cont.): <small>&#x003C;ARISE AND MAKE A GOD FOR US WHO WILL GO BEFORE US, &#x003E; FOR THIS IS THE MAN, MOSES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn670">43</xref></sup> At that time Hur said to them: O stiff-necked &#x003C; people &#x003E;, do you not remember what he did for you?<sup><xref rid="fn671">44</xref></sup> They arose and killed him.<sup><xref rid="fn672">45</xref></sup> Then they gathered together against Aaron, as stated (ibid.): <small>THE PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST AARON</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn673">46</xref></sup> They said to him: If you make a god for us, well and good; but if not, we will do to you just as we did to Hur. (Exod. 32:5:) <small>WHEN AARON SAW THIS</small>, &#x003C;i.e., when&#x003E; he saw what they had done to Hur, (ibid., cont.) <small>HE BUILT</small> (<small>YBN</small>) <small>AN ALTAR</small> (<small>MZBH</small>), &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; he understood (<small>HBYN</small>) from the slaughtered (<small>MZBWH</small>) one.<sup><xref rid="fn674">47</xref></sup> They wanted to build &#x003C;the altar&#x003E; along with him. He said to them, leave me alone, and I will make it by myself, for no one is to build it along with me. Now Aaron had a plan. &#x003C;He was&#x003E; saying &#x003C;to himself&#x003E;: While I am building it, Moses will come down.<sup><xref rid="fn675">48</xref></sup> Immediately (in Exod. 32:6): <small>SO THEY ROSE EARLY THE NEXT DAY, &#x003C; OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS, AND BROUGHT PEACE OFFERINGS</small>&#x003E;; [<small>AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK</small>.] In every place that you find sitting, there you find degradation.<sup><xref rid="fn676">49</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 37:25): <small>THEN THEY SAT DOWN TO EAT BREAD</small>. What degradation happened there? &#x003C;It was there&#x003E; that they sold Joseph. It is also written (in Numb. 25:1): <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING</small> (literally: <small>SITTING</small>) <small>AT SHITTIM</small>. And what was the degradation there? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING &#x003C;WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB</small>&#x003E;. And here too (in Exod. 32:6): <small>THEN THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN</small>, &#x003C;i.e., in&#x003E; the sitting of idolatry. The Holy One said to Moses; They have risen to revel in idolatry, while you are sitting &#x003C;up here&#x003E;. (Exod. 32:7:) <small>GO AND GET DOWN</small>. At that time Moses was going to go down, but he saw the angels of destruction and was afraid to go down. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 9:19): <small>FOR I WAS AFRAID OF ANGER AND RAGE</small>. What did he do? He went and grasped the throne, as stated (in Job 26:9): <small>HE</small> (Moses) <small>GRASPS THE FACE OF A THRONE</small>; [<small>HE</small> (the Holy One) <small>SPREAD HIS CLOUD UPON HIM</small>]. So the Holy One protected him and spread some of the radiance of his Divine Presence over him. Come and see how many troubles they caused. Yesterday Moses had shoved them (the angels of destruction) aside,<sup><xref rid="fn677">50</xref></sup> and now he was afraid of them. (Deut. 9:19:) <small>FOR I WAS AFRAID OF</small> [<small>ANGER AND RAGE</small>]. The five angels of destruction were <italic>Af</italic> (Anger), <italic>Qetsef</italic> (Wrath), <italic>Meshabber</italic> (Smasher), <italic>Mashhit</italic> (Destroyer), <italic>and Hemah</italic> (Rage); <sup><xref rid="fn678">51</xref></sup> Moses mentioned three patriarchs, and three &#x003C;angels&#x003E; went away.<sup><xref rid="fn679">52</xref></sup> But <small>ANGER AND RAGE</small> remained behind. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World: You stand up to one and I to one, as stated (in Ps. 7:7 [6]): <small>RISE UP, O LORD, IN YOUR</small> <italic>Af</italic> (<small>ANGER</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn680">53</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in Exod. 32:7): <small>GO AND GET DOWN</small>; you have a descent (i.e., degradation). He said to him: Why? <small>HE SAID TO HIM: BECAUSE YOUR PEOPLE &#x003C;WHOM YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x003E; HAVE ACTED BASELY</small>. Moses said to him: Now are they my people and not your people&#x0021; (Exod. 32:12:) <small>TURN BACK FROM YOUR WRATHFUL ANGER</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: Moses did not move from praying until the Holy One was reconciled to them. The Holy One said: In this world you sinned against me because the evil drive was ordering you; but in the world to come I am rooting it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn681">54</xref></sup></p>
<title>9.14 Exodus 33:12ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 33:12:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: SEE, YOU &#x003C;SAY UNTO ME: BRING THIS PEOPLE UP</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. it is written (in Ps. 77:6 [5]): <small>I HAVE CONSIDERED THE DAYS OF OLD</small>. The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, we sit and consider how many years you took to redeem us from Egypt, how many years you took to redeem us from Greece.<sup><xref rid="fn682">55</xref></sup> (Ps. 77:11 [10]) <small>THIS IS MY WEAKNESS</small> (rt.: <small>HLH</small>), <small>THAT THE RIGHT HAND OF THE MOST HIGH MIGHT CHANGE</small>. Resh Laqish said: If they are sick (rt.: <small>HLH</small>), they can be healed.<sup><xref rid="fn683">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 77:11 [10]): <small>THIS IS MY ENTREATY</small> (rt.: <small>HLT</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn684">57</xref></sup> R. Alexandri said: All these things which came upon us happened because we did not entreat (rt.: <small>HLH</small>) the Holy One, and this word (<small>ENTREATY</small>) can only be a word for prayer. It is so used (in Mal. 1:9): <small>AND NOW ENTREAT</small> (rt.: <small>HLT</small>) <small>THE FAVOR OF GOD</small>&#x0021; (Ps. 77:8 [7]:) <small>WILL THE LORD FOREVER REJECT AND NEVER AGAIN BE FAVORABLE</small>? In the past, when Moses was angry with Israel, the Holy One would placate him. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 33:11): <small>&#x003C;THE LORD WOULD SPEAK UNTO MOSES FACE TO FACE AS ONE SPEAKS UNTO HIS FRIEND. &#x003E; THEN HE WOULD RETURN UNTO THE CAMP</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>(Exod. 33:12:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a cavern which was located on the edge of the sea, and &#x003C;the sea&#x003E; filled it.<sup><xref rid="fn685">58</xref></sup> From then on the sea was flowing into the cave, and the cave making a return to the sea. (Exod. 33:1:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES</small>. (Exod. 33:5:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES</small>. (Exod. 33:12:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn686">59</xref></sup></p>
<title>9.15 Exodus 33:12ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 33:12:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in vs. 5)? <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES: SAY UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL: YOU ARE A STIFF-NECKED PEOPLE&#x2026;. NOW THEN, REMOVE YOUR ORNAMENTS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>YOUR ORNAMENTS</small>? R. Simeon said: The weaponry which the Holy One gave them with the Ineffable Name inscribed upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn687">60</xref></sup> Immediately (in vs. 6), <small>SO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF ORNAMENTS</small> (i.e., their weapons). When Moses saw that they had lost the good gift, he became angry with them.</p>
<p>(Exod. 33:7:) <small>NOW MOSES WOULD TAKE THE TENT</small> [&#x2026;.<small>FAR AWAY</small> (rt.: <small>RHQ</small>) <small>FROM THE CAMP</small>]. How far was it? A mile.<sup><xref rid="fn688">61</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Josh. 3:4): <small>YET THERE SHALL BE A DISTANCE</small> (rt.: <small>RHQ</small>) <small>BETWEEN YOU AND IT</small> (the Ark of the Covenant) <small>OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CUBITS BY MEASURE</small>. Resh Laqish said: It is comparable to a king who had one legion.<sup><xref rid="fn689">62</xref></sup> When &#x003C;the legion&#x003E; revolted against the king, what did the head of that army do? He took the royal standard<sup><xref rid="fn690">63</xref></sup> and fled. So Moses, when Israel committed that act, took the Tabernacle and went away.</p>
<p>(Exod. 33:7, cont.:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ANYONE WHO SOUGHT THE LORD &#x003C;WOULD GO OUT UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING, WHICH WAS OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>&#x003E;. &#x201C;Anyone who sought Moses&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>ANYONE WHO SOUGHT THE LORD</small>. This &#x003C; wording &#x003E; teaches that everyone who welcomes an elder fulfills Torah. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; as though he is welcoming the Divine Presence. For even the angels, the seraphim, and the &#x003C; heavenly&#x003E; hosts were seeking him to obtain his permission to go forth. They would say to one another: Here he is in the tabernacle of Moses. When sun and moon want to get permission to go forth into the world, they go unto the tent. (Exod. 33:7:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ANYONE WHO SOUGHT THE LORD</small> [<small>WOULD GO OUT UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING WHICH WAS OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>.]</p>
<p>(Exod. 33:8:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN MOSES WOULD GO OUT</small> &#x007B;<small>TO</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THE TENT</small>, they would stand at the sides and honor him by saying: Blessed is the woman who gave birth to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn691">64</xref></sup> What would he see in it?<sup><xref rid="fn692">65</xref></sup> (Exod. 33:9:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN MOSES WOULD GO</small> [<small>TO THE TENT</small>], <small>THE PILLAR OF CLOUD WOULD DESCEND</small>. They knew that the Divine Presence was being revealed to Moses. (Exod. 33:10): <small>ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE &#x003C;AND BOW DOWN, EACH AT THE ENTRANCE OF HIS TENT</small>&#x003E;. The Holy One said to him: Moses, return unto the camp. He said to him. I am not going back. The Holy One said to him: Be aware that Joshua is in the Tabernacle. To what is the matter comparable? To a matron,<sup><xref rid="fn693">66</xref></sup> who became angry with the king and left the palace.<sup><xref rid="fn694">67</xref></sup> Now she had been raising a certain orphan girl in the palace. The king sent after the matron and said to her: Return unto the palace; but she did not want to return. The Holy one said to her: I am telling you to return, but you are unwilling. Be aware that the orphan girl is being installed in the palace. So (in Exod. 33:11): <small>THE LORD WOULD SPEAK UNTO MOSES FACE TO FACE &#x003C;AS ONE SPEAKS UNTO HIS FRIEND</small>&#x003E;. What did he speak? Return unto the camp. But he did not wish to return. The Holy One said: I am telling you to return, but you do not wish &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;. By your life, Joshua is in the Tent of meeting.<sup><xref rid="fn695">68</xref></sup> Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, was it not for your sake that I was angry with them? (Exod. 33:12:) <small>SEE, YOU SAY UNTO ME: &#x003C;BRING THIS PEOPLE UP</small>&#x003E;. See, you cannot forsake them.<sup><xref rid="fn696">69</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: I have already told you (in Exod. 23:20): <small>AND I AM SENDING</small><sup><xref rid="fn697">70</xref></sup> <small>AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU</small>. Moses said to him: Are you delivering me to an angel? (Exod. 33:15:) <small>UNLESS YOUR PRESENCE GOES ALONG, DO NOT MAKE US GO UP FROM HERE</small>. (Exod. 33:13:) <small>AND NOW, IF I HAVE TRULY FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES, &#x003C; PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAYS KNOWN TO ME</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<title>9.16 Exodus 33:12ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 33:21:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: SEE, THERE IS A PLACE WITH ME</small>,&#x2026;. R. Jose bar Halafta said: &#x201C;See I am in this place,&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>SEE, THERE IS A PLACE WITH ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">71</xref></sup> My place is secondary to me; so would I be secondary to my place? Exod. 33:19:) <small>AND HE SAID: I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS &#x003C; BEFORE YOU</small>&#x003E;. Goodness, <small>ALL MY GOODNESS</small>, &#x003C;also implies &#x003E; the attribute of punishment.<sup><xref rid="fn699">72</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small>. At that time the Holy One showed him all the treasuries with the rewards which are prepared for the righteous. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, To whom does this treasury belong? He said to him: To those who act with righteousness. To whom does this one belong? To those who support orphans. And it was so for each and every treasury, until he saw a certain huge treasury. He said to him: To whom does this one belong? He said to him: To the one who has &#x003C; merit &#x003E;, to him I give what belongs to him out of &#x003C;this one&#x003E;; but to the one who has not, for him I do it gratis, &#x003C;and give it to him from here&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn700">73</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 33:19): <small>I WILL BE GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small>. &#x007B;&#x201C;Who is prepared&#x201D;&#x007D; [&#x201C;To whom we will be gracious&#x201D;] is not written here, but <small>TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 33:20:) <small>HE ALSO SAID: YOU CANNOT SEE MY FACE</small>. Moses wanted to understand about the reward for &#x003C; keeping the&#x003E; commandments and about the prosperity of the wicked. The Holy One said to him: <small>YOU CANNOT</small> [<small>SEE MY FACE</small>] (i.e., understand about the prosperity of the wicked). Now this word (<small>FACE</small>) can only be a word for the prosperity of the wicked. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 7:10): <small>AND &#x003C;GOD&#x003E; REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM</small> [<small>TO THEIR FACE</small>&#x2026;.]<sup><xref rid="fn701">74</xref></sup> The Holy One said [to him] (in Exod. 33:23): <small>THEN I WILL TAKE AWAY MY HAND</small>. In this world I show you the reward of those who fear &#x003C;me&#x003E;, but in the world to come I will show the goodness which is laid up for them. David said (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>.</p>
<title>9.17 Exodus 34:27ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 34:27:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small>. This text is related (to Hos. 8:12): <small>SHOULD I WRITE THE FULL ABUNDANCE OF MY TORAH</small> (i.e., including the Oral Torah) <small>FOR HIM</small>? When the Holy One came to give the Torah, he spoke it to Moses in &#x003C;this&#x003E; order: the Scripture, the Mishnah, the Aggadah, and the Talmud.<sup><xref rid="fn702">75</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Exod. 20:1): <small>THEN GOD SPOKE ALL THESE WORDS</small>. At that time the Holy One told Moses even what an advanced student &#x003C;one day&#x003E; would ask his teacher, as stated (ibid.): <small>THEN GOD SPOKE ALL &#x003C;THESE&#x003E; WORDS</small>. After Moses had learned it, the Holy One said to him: Go and teach it to my children. Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, write it down for your children. He said to him: I want to give it to them in writing, because it has been revealed to me that the peoples of the world are going to have dominion over them and take it away from them, so that my children would be like the peoples of the world. Then give them the Scripture in writing but the Mishnah, the Aggadah, and the Talmud orally. (Exod. 34:27): <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WRITE DOWN &#x003C; THESE WORDS</small> &#x003E;. This is Scripture. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR ORALLY IN</small><sup><xref rid="fn703">76</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;THESE WORDS</small>&#x2026;, i.e.&#x003E; in the Mishnah and the Talmud, since they separate Israel from the peoples of the world.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; (Exod. 34:27:) <small>WRITE DOWN &#x003C;THESE WORDS&#x003E; FOR YOURSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn704">77</xref></sup> With regard to the first tablets, I wrote them, as stated (in Exod. 31:18): <small>WRITTEN WITH THE FINGER OF GOD</small>; but with regard to the second ones (in Exod. 34:27): You <small>WRITE DOWN &#x003C;THESE WORDS&#x003E; FOR YOURSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn705">78</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who took a wife and wrote her a <italic>gamitos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn706">79</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., a marriage contract&#x007D; at his own &#x003C;expense&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn707">80</xref></sup> She brought nothing but disgrace, so he drove her out. Her bridal sponsor came and reconciled her to the king. The king said to her: See, I have been reconciled. Simply go and make another <italic>gamitos</italic>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 34:27:) <small>WRITE DOWN &#x003C;THESE WORDS &#x003E; FOR YOURSELF</small>. Through your merit I am giving them the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn708">81</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Halafta said: That is what Moses said to them (in Deut. 10:1&#x2013;2): <small>&#x003C;AT THAT TIME THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: CARVE OUT TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST ONES&#x2026;.&#x003E; THEN I WILL WRITE UPON THE TABLETS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn709">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 34:27): <small>WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small> <italic>devarim</italic>.

<p>(Exod. 34:27:) <small>&#x003C;AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES:&#x003E; WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small>, [<small>FOR ORALLY IN THESE WORDS</small>&#x2026;. ]<sup><xref rid="fn712">85</xref></sup> R.

I gave you Written Torah and Oral Torah. If you make what is in writing oral and what is oral into writing so as to reverse them, you will not receive a reward. Why? Because I gave you Written Torah and Oral Torah. I also made a covenant with you with the stipulation that you recite them in this way; but if you change it, know that you will invalidate the covenant. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:9): <small>LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>, &#x003C;things&#x003E; which are written down in writing. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>AND LEST THEY DEPART FROM YOUR HEART</small>. These are &#x003C; words &#x003E; that are oral.</p>

Because of the Torah I love Israel; and not Israel alone, but also Moses, [&#x003C;since&#x003E; he magnified him] by virtue of the Law. <small>FOR ORALLY IN THESE WORDS I HAVE MADE A COVENANT WITH YOU</small>. And how did he magnify Moses? R. Samuel said in the name of R. Jeremiah bar Isaac: When he saw all the glory in this world, he took nothing from the principal (<small>QRN</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn713">86</xref></sup> Rather the principal (i.e., the shining) remains in tact for him in the age to come.</p>
<title>9.19 Exodus 34:27ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 34:28:) <small>AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS</small>; [<small>HE ATE NO BREAD AND DRANK NO WATER</small>]. Is it possible for someone to remain forty days without eating and drinking?<sup><xref rid="fn714">87</xref></sup> When angels came down to Abraham from heaven, they ate. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Moses went up to the heavenly places &#x003C;and&#x003E; saw that there was no eating or drinking there, he did not eat and drink.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; (Exod. 34:28:) <small>AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. There was a story about R. Johanan, that he went from Tiberias to Sepphoris; and R. Hiyya bar Abba was with him.<sup><xref rid="fn715">88</xref></sup> Now the two of them were walking along the road when R. Johanan saw a vineyard. He said to R. Hiyya: This belonged to me, but I sold it for so much. And likewise a field of olive trees belonged me but I sold it for so much. R. Hiyya said to him: Of all the <italic>ousia</italic> &#x007B;i.e., fields&#x007D;,<sup><xref rid="fn716">89</xref></sup> did you not have something to leave for your old age? He said to him: I sold something that was worth six gold coins and bought something worth forty gold coins. He said to him: What did you get? He said to him: I sold something, &#x003C;i.e. &#x003E; fields and vineyards, which were created in six days; and I bought Torah, which was created in forty days.</p>
<p>(Exod. 34:28:) <small>AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. <small>HE ATE NO BREAD</small>. He ate from the bread of Torah. <small>AND DRANK NO WATER</small>. He drank from the water of Torah. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 9:5): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. And it says (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small> (of Torah).</p>
<p>&#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; (Exod. 34:28:) <small>AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD</small>. He was learning Torah by day and interpreting it by night all by himself. Why? Simply to teach Israel that they should labor in the Torah day and night. And from where was he nourished those forty days? From the splendor of the Divine Presence.</p>
<title>9.20 Exodus 34:27ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 34:28:) <small>AND HE WROTE DOWN UPON THE TABLETS</small> [<small>THE WORDS OF THE COVENANT, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</small>]. Thus the first and the second (copies of the commandments) were the same.<sup><xref rid="fn717">90</xref></sup> And how were &#x003C;the&#x003E; ten commandments written? Five on one tablet and five on the other tablet. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>THE TEN COMMANDMENTS</small>.</p>
<p>(Exod. 34:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, WHEN MOSES CAME DOWN&#x2026; FROM THE MOUNTAIN</small>, [<small>MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE WAS SHINING</small>]. From where did Moses receive the rays of glory?<sup><xref rid="fn718">91</xref></sup> Our masters say: From the cave. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 33:22): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT WHEN MY GLORY PASSES BY</small>, [<small>I WILL PUT YOU IN A CLEFT OF THE ROCK</small>]. R. Berekhyah said: From the tablets.<sup><xref rid="fn719">92</xref></sup> R. &#x003C;Berekhyah&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn720">93</xref></sup> said: Their length was six handbreadths, and their width was three handbreadths.<sup><xref rid="fn721">94</xref></sup> Then Moses grasped two handbreadths, the Holy One grasped two handbreadths, and there was a space of two handbreadths in the middle. It was from there that Moses received the rays of glory. R. Judah bar Nehemiah says: While Moses was writing the Torah, a little &#x003C;ink&#x003E; remained on the pen.<sup><xref rid="fn722">95</xref></sup> So he passed it over his head (to dry it on his hair), and it was from there that the rays of glory were produced for him. (Exod. 34:29:) <small>MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT &#x003C;THE SKIN OF HIS FACE&#x003E; WAS SHINING</small> (<small>QRN</small>). All the glory that he received &#x003C;came&#x003E; as an &#x003C; extra &#x003E; reward, but the principal (<small>QRN</small>) remained in tact, as stated (in Hab. 3:4): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>RAYS &#x003C;COMING&#x003E; FROM HIS HAND</small>. So when the righteous receive their reward in the world to come, he will &#x003C;also&#x003E; receive his reward. Where is it shown? Where the prophet has so declared, when he said (in Is. 40:10): <small>BEHOLD, THE LORD GOD COMES IN MIGHT, AND HIS MIGHTY ARM RULES FOR HIM. BEHOLD, HIS REWARD IS WITH HIM, AND HIS RECOMPENSE BEFORE HIM</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 10 Exodus, Parashah X: <italic>Wayyaqhel</italic></title>
<title>10.1 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 35:1:) <small>THEN MOSES ASSEMBLED</small>&#x2026;. (Exod. 35:30:) <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL: SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED &#x003C;BEZALEL</small>&#x2026;&#x003E; <small>BY NAME</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>; for in the case of good oil, how far does its fragrance travel?<sup><xref rid="fn723">1</xref></sup> One or two miles?<sup><xref rid="fn724">2</xref></sup> But a good name travels the earth from one end to the other. Ergo (in Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>.</p>
<p>(Eccl. 7:1, cont.:) <small>AND THE DAY OF DEATH THAN THE DAY OF ONE&#x2019;S BIRTH</small>, (i.e.) the day of one&#x2019;s death &#x003C;is better&#x003E; than the day on which one was born. Why? On the day on which one is born, no one knows whether his deeds will be worthy or not; but when he dies, he makes known his deeds to humankind.</p>
<p>(Eccl. 7:1:) <small>AND THE DAY OF DEATH THAN THE DAY OF ONE&#x2019;S BIRTH</small>. R. Levi said: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn725">3</xref></sup> To two ships which were at sea full of merchandise. One was coming and the other was going. The one which was coming they praised. &#x003C;Those who&#x003E; stood by them were amazed. They said: Why are you praising this one when you do not praise the other one. They said to them: We praise this one which came back, because we know that it went away safely and came back safely; but as for the other one, we do not know what it is going to do. Likewise, when someone is born, no child of Adam knows about his &#x003C;future&#x003E; deeds. When he has departed from the world they do know what his deeds were. Ergo: <small>AND THE DAY OF DEATH THAN THE DAY OF ONE&#x2019;S BIRTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>. The Names of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were &#x003C;better&#x003E; than the good oil with which Nadab and Abihu were anointed.<sup><xref rid="fn726">4</xref></sup> Why? The children of Aaron went in to sacrifice and were burned;<sup><xref rid="fn727">5</xref></sup> Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were thrown into the midst of a fiery furnace and were saved.<sup><xref rid="fn728">6</xref></sup> Ergo (in Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:1): <small>A GOOD NAME &#x003C;IS BETTER THAN GOOD OIL</small>&#x003E;. The name of Bezalel was better <small>THAN GOOD OIL</small>. Why? Because the scriptural verse has proclaimed<sup><xref rid="fn729">7</xref></sup> it, where it is stated (in Exod. 35:30); <small>AND MOSES SAID UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL: SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; BY NAME</small></p>
<title>10.2 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; BY NAME.</small>] This text is related (to Is. 40:25&#x2013;26): <small>THEN UNTO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME THAT I SHOULD BE EQUAL? SAYS THE HOLY ONE. LIFT UP YOUR EYES ON HIGH &#x003C;AND SEE: WHO CREATED THESE</small>? &#x003E;&#x2026;. The Holy One said: <small>THEN UNTO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME</small>? If &#x003C;a person of&#x003E; flesh and blood is walking in the darkness, when someone comes and gives him light, should he not be grateful to him?<sup><xref rid="fn730">8</xref></sup> Now you are asleep at night when I cause the light to rise for you. Should you not be grateful to me? (Is. 40:26:) <small>LIFT UP YOUR EYES ON HIGH &#x003C;AND SEE; WHO CREATED THESE</small>?&#x003E;&#x2026;. By virtue of what do they stand? <small>THESE</small> (in Gen. 2:4:): <small>THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn731">9</xref></sup> By virtue of <small>THESE</small> (in Exod. 1:1): <small>THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn732">10</xref></sup> And these are by virtue of whom? By virtue of <small>THESE</small> (in Deut. 4:45): <small>THE TESTIMONIES, THE STATUTES, AND THE JUDGMENTS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn733">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Is. 40:26:) <small>WHO CREATED THESE</small>? [<small>THE ONE WHO SENDS FORTH THEIR HOST BY NUMBER. HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &#x003C;A SINGLE&#x003E; NAME</small>.] It is written (ibid.): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &#x003C;A SINGLE &#x003E; NAME</small>. But one scriptural verse says, <small>NAMES</small> (i.e., Ps. 147:4): [<small>HE GIVES NAMES TO THEM ALL</small>]. If &#x003C;Ps. 147:4 says&#x003E; <small>NAMES</small>, why &#x003C;does Is. 40:26 say&#x003E; <small>BY &#x003C;A SINGLE&#x003E; NAME</small>? If &#x003C;Is. 40:26 says&#x003E; <small>BY &#x003C;A SINGLE&#x003E; NAME</small>, why &#x003C;does Ps. 147:4 say&#x003E; <small>NAMES</small>? It is simply that, when the Holy One wishes, he calls them all as a single &#x003C;unit&#x003E;; but when he wishes &#x003C;otherwise&#x003E;, he calls each and every one by his own name, &#x003C;e.g.&#x003E; Michael and Gabriel. Ergo (in Is. 40:26): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY &#x003C;A SINGLE&#x003E; NAME</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 40:26): <small>HE CALLS THEM ALL BY NAME</small>. So it is for above. Where is it shown for below? Where it is stated (in Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED &#x003C;BEZALEL&#x2026;&#x003E; BY NAME</small>.</p>
<title>10.3 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 38:23:) <small>AND WITH HIM</small> (i.e., with Bezalel) <small>WASOHOLIAB BEN AHISAMACH</small> [<small>OF THE TRIBE OF DAN</small>]. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; glory for himself, glory for his father, glory for his family, and glory for his tribe, because he came from it. (Lev. 24:11, concerning an unnamed blasphemer): <small>AND THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER WAS SHELOMITH BAT DIBRI &#x003C;OF THE TRIBE OF DAN</small>&#x003E;. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a disgrace for himself, a disgrace for his father, a disgrace for his mother, a disgrace for his family, &#x003C;and&#x003E; a disgrace for his tribe, because he came from it. (Josh. 7:1): <small>ACHAN BEN CARMI BEN ZABDI BEN ZERAH, OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</small>. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a disgrace for himself, a disgrace for his father, a disgrace for his family, &#x003C;and&#x003E; a disgrace for his tribe, because he came from it. (Exod. 38:22:) <small>NOW BEZALEL BEN URI BEN HUR</small> [<small>OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</small>]. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; glory for himself, glory for his father, glory for his family, glory for his tribe because he came from it.</p>
<title>10.4 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED</small> [<small>BEZALEL BEN URI BEN HUR</small>] <small>&#x003C;OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH&#x003E; BY NAME</small>. What need was there for Hur to be mentioned here?<sup><xref rid="fn734">12</xref></sup> It was simply that he had given his life for the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn735">13</xref></sup> When Israel wanted to practice idolatry, he did not allow them. They arose and killed him. The Holy One said: By your life, I am repaying you. To what is the matter comparable? To a king whose legions<sup><xref rid="fn736">14</xref></sup> rebelled.<sup><xref rid="fn737">15</xref></sup> The commander of his army arose and fought with them. He said to them: You are rebelling against the king. They arose against him and killed him. The king came and said: Where is the head of my army? They said to him: The legions have killed him. The king said to him: By your life, if you had given money to me, I should have repaid you. Now you have given your life for me. By your life, to all the children which you have I will give world-wide fame. I will make them commanders<sup><xref rid="fn738">16</xref></sup> and governors.<sup><xref rid="fn739">17</xref></sup> Similarly, Hur gave his life for the Holy One during the incident of the &#x003C; golden &#x003E; calf. The Holy One said to him: By your life, to all your children I will give world-wide fame. (Exod. 35:30&#x2013;31:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED &#x003C;BEZALEL BEN URI BEN HUR OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH&#x003E; BY NAME; AND HE HAS FILLED HIM WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>. And &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; does not speak about Bezalel alone, but about any who were engaged in the work of the tabernacle. In them the Holy One instilled understanding, wisdom and knowledge. It is so stated (in Exod. 36:8): <small>THEN ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES &#x003C; AMONG THE WORKERS MADE THE TABERNACLE</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. But out of all of them none was proclaimed &#x003C;by name&#x003E; except Bezalel. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 35:30:) <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED BEZALEL &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; BY NAME</small>.</p>
<title>10.5 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part V</title>
<p>Now from where did all this glory come?<sup><xref rid="fn740">18</xref></sup> From the tribe of Judah, since it is stated (in Exod. 35:30): <small>&#x003C;BEZALEL BEN URI BEN HUR&#x003E; OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</small>. This text is related (to Job 28:27&#x2013;28): <small>THEN HE SAW AND DECLARED IT; HE ESTABLISHED IT AND ALSO PROBED IT; AND HE SAID TO THE MAN</small> (i.e., to Moses): <small>SEE, THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS WISDOM; AND TO DEPART FROM EVIL IS UNDERSTANDING</small>. R. Aha and our masters differ.<sup><xref rid="fn741">19</xref></sup> Our masters say: Two times he uttered the oracle privately to himself. Then after that he spoke to Israel. Thus it is stated (in Job. 28:27): <small>THEN HE SAW AND DECLARED IT</small>. That was one &#x003C;time&#x003E;. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE ESTABLISHED IT AND ALSO PROBED IT</small>. That was the second &#x003C;time&#x003E;. Then after that he said (in vs. 28): <small>AND HE SAID TO THE MAN</small> (Moses). But R. Aha said: Four times, as stated (in vs. 27): <small>THEN HE SAW AND DECLARED IT; HE ESTABLISHED IT AND ALSO PROBED IT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn742">20</xref></sup> Ergo: Four times.<sup><xref rid="fn743">21</xref></sup> From whom do you learn it? From Jochebed<sup><xref rid="fn744">22</xref></sup> and Miriam. What is written (in Exod. 1:15)? <small>THEN THE KING OF EGYPT</small> &#x007B;<small>PROCLAIMED</small>&#x007D; [<small>SAID</small>] <small>TO THE &#x003C;HEBREW&#x003E; MIDWIVES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn745">23</xref></sup> What did he say to them (in vs. 16)? <small>LOOK AT THE BIRTHSTOOL</small>. Why did he do so? Because the astrologers<sup><xref rid="fn746">24</xref></sup> had said to them: On this day the redeemer of Israel shall be born, but we do not know whether he is an Egyptian or not. At that time he assembled all the Egyptians and said to them: Lend me your sons for one day, since it is stated (in Exod. 1:22): <small>EVERY SON BORN &#x003C;YOU SHALL THROW INTO THE NILE</small>&#x003E;. &#x201C;&#x003C; Every son&#x003E; of Israel&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>EVERY SON</small>, whether Israelite or Egyptian. (Exod. 1:17:) <small>BUT THE MIDWIVES FEARED &#x003C;GOD</small>&#x003E;. So how did the Holy One repay them? (Vs. 3:) <small>HE ESTABLISHED HOUSEHOLDS FOR THEM</small>: Priestly households, Levitical households, and kingship. Jochebed received priesthood and kingship as her reward &#x003C; through her sons&#x003E;, Moses<sup><xref rid="fn747">25</xref></sup> and Aaron. What did Miriam receive as her reward? Wisdom, for it is stated (in Job 28:28): <small>SEE, THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS WISDOM</small>. From her he brought forth Bezalel, who was wise, as stated (in Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT &#x003C;IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>10.6 Exodus 35:1ff., 35:30ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 35:30): <small>SEE, THE LORD HAS CALLED</small> [&#x2026; <small>IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>]. See the wisdom, [understanding, and knowledge] which I have instilled in his heart (i.e., the heart of Bezalel).<sup><xref rid="fn748">26</xref></sup> By these three things were heaven and earth created,<sup><xref rid="fn749">27</xref></sup> as stated (in Prov. 3:19&#x2013;20): <small>THROUGH WISDOM THE LORD FOUNDED THE EARTH; HE ESTABLISHED THE HEAVENS THROUGH UNDERSTANDING</small>; [<small>THROUGH HIS KNOWLEDGE THE DEPTHS BURST APART</small>]. Moreover, by these three things was the Tabernacle made, as stated (in Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>. Again, by these three things was the Temple made, as stated (in I Kings 7:14): <small>HE</small> (i.e., Hiram) <small>WAS THE SON OF A WIDOW&#x2026;; AND HE WAS FILLED WITH WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE</small>. And also in the world to come the Temple shall be built on these three things, [as stated (in Prov. 24:3&#x2013;4): <small>THROUGH WISDOM SHALL A HOUSE BE BUILT, BY UNDERSTANDING SHALL IT BE ESTABLISHED, AND BY KNOWLEDGE SHALL ITS ROOMS BE FILLED WITH ALL PRECIOUS AND LOVELY RICHES</small>. Ergo (in Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM &#x003C;WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Exod. 31:3): <small>AND I HAVE FILLED HIM &#x003C;WITH THE DIVINE SPIRIT IN WISDOM, UNDERSTANDING, AND KNOWLEDGE &#x003E;</small>. Joshua, who came from the tribe of Joseph, was also filled with the spirit of wisdom, as stated (in Deut. 34:9): <small>NOW JOSHUA BEN NUN WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM</small>. Also Othniel ben Kenaz, who was from the tribe of Judah, was filled with the spirit of God, as stated (in Jud. 3:10): <small>AND THE SPIRIT OF</small> &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>CAME UPON HIM</small>. Now all this was by virtue of the blessing with which Moses blessed this tribe, as stated (in Deut. 33:7): <small>AND THIS IS FOR JUDAH</small>, [<small>AND HE SAID: HEAR, O LORD, THE VOICE OF JUDAH</small>&#x2026;.] The Holy One said to Israel: in this world my Spirit shall instill wisdom within you, but in the world to come I &#x003C;myself&#x003E; will teach you, as stated (in Ezek. 37:14): <small>I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE</small>.</p>
<title>10.7 Exodus 37:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 119:130): <small>THE OPENING OF YOUR WORDS ENLIGHTEN; IT GIVES UNDERSTANDING TO THE SIMPLE</small>. R. Simeon [ben Jehozadak] asked R. Samuel bar &#x007B;Nehemiah&#x007D; [Nahman]: &#x003C; Since &#x003E; you are a master of Haggadah, tell me: How did the Holy One create the world?<sup><xref rid="fn750">28</xref></sup> He said to him: When the Holy One wanted to create the world, he wrapped himself in light and created his world, as stated (in Ps. 104:2): <small>WHO PUTS ON LIGHT LIKE A GARMENT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn751">29</xref></sup> After that (in the same vs.): <small>WHO SPREADS OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A SHEET</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 119:130): <small>THE OPENING OF YOUR WORDS ENLIGHTEN</small>&#x2026;. R. Judah said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king &#x007B;who had&#x007D; [who wanted to build himself] a palace,<sup><xref rid="fn752">30</xref></sup> but that place was &#x007B;one of&#x007D; darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn753">31</xref></sup> What did he do? He lit the lamps, and afterwards he built a palace. So when the Holy One built the world, it was all darkness. What did he do? He wrapped himself in light and created it. Ergo (in Exod. 119:130): <small>THE OPENING</small> (<small>PTH</small>) <small>OF YOUR WORDS ENLIGHTEN</small>&#x2026;. From the Holy One the righteous have learned that they should begin &#x003C;any task&#x003E; in light. When the Holy One said to him (i.e., to Moses in Exod. 25:8): <small>AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY</small>, Moses told Bezalel to make a Tabernacle. With what did he first begin (<small>PTH</small>)? The work on the Ark. (Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK</small>.</p>
<title>10.8 Exodus 37:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK</small>.] This text is related to (Prov. 9:9): <small>GIVE TO ONE WHO IS WISE, AND HE WILL BE STILL WISER; INFORM ONE WHO IS RIGHTEOUS, AND HE WILL INCREASE IN LEARNING</small>. &#x003C;The verse&#x003E; speaks about Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn754">32</xref></sup> When he made the ark, the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 7:2): <small>OF EVERY CLEAN BEAST</small> [<small>YOU SHALL TAKE SEVEN PAIRS</small>&#x2026;.] When he left &#x003C;the ark&#x003E;, he sacrificed some of the clean &#x003C; animals &#x003E;. He said: Did not the Holy One increase the clean animals simply so that I might sacrifice some of them?<sup><xref rid="fn755">33</xref></sup> Ergo (in Prov. 9:9): <small>GIVE TO ONE WHO IS WISE</small>&#x2026;. This is Noah.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 9:9): <small>GIVE TO ONE WHO IS WISE</small>&#x2026;. This was Moses. When the Holy One gave him the Torah, he went and taught it to Israel. Thus he increased the value of his words.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 9:9): <small>GIVE TO ONE WHO IS WISE</small>&#x2026;. This is Bezalel. When Moses said to Bezalel: Make a Tabernacle, Bezalel said: What is the Tabernacle for? He said to him: To have the Divine Presence dwell within it and teach Israel Torah. Bezalel said: And where will the Torah be put? He said to him: When we make a Tabernacle, we shall make an Ark. So he began with the Ark, as stated (in Exod. 37:1) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>10.9 Exodus 37:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK OF ACACIA WOOD</small>.] &#x007B;R.&#x007D; Jeremiah said (in Jer. 30:17): <small>FOR I WILL RESTORE HEALTH TO YOU, AND I WILL HEAL YOU OF YOUR WOUNDS</small>. A king of flesh and blood wounds with a knife<sup><xref rid="fn756">34</xref></sup> and heals with a bandage, but the Holy One is not like that.<sup><xref rid="fn757">35</xref></sup> The very thing which he uses for wounding he uses for healing. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 15:23): <small>WHEN THEY CAME TO MARAH</small>, [<small>THEY COULD NOT DRINK THE WATER OF MARAH BECAUSE IT WAS BITTER</small> (marim)]. R. Levi said: Why? <small>BECAUSE IT WAS BITTER</small>. The generation was bitter in its deeds. (Exod. 15:25:) <small>THEN HE</small> (i.e., Moses) <small>CRIED UNTO THE LORD</small>, [<small>AND THE LORD SHOWED HIM A TREE</small>]. The Holy One gave him bitter wood, he put it into the bitter &#x003C;water&#x003E;, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>THE WATER BECAME SWEET</small>. Ergo (in Jer. 30:17): <small>AND I WILL HEAL YOU OF YOUR WOUNDS</small>. Also, when Israel sinned at Shittim, the Holy One said to them: By your life, through that in which you sinned, you shall be healed. (Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE THE ARK</small> [<small>OF ACACIA</small> (<italic>shittim</italic>) <small>WOOD</small>].</p>
<title>10.10 Exodus 37:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>&#x007B;Our masters have said:&#x007D; What is written above on the matter (in Exod. 36:35)? <small>AND HE MADE THE VEIL</small>&#x2026;. [Our masters have said:]<sup><xref rid="fn758">36</xref></sup> The veil was a span in thickness and woven on a seventy-two-thread warp with twenty-four threads on each and every strand. Its length was forty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits. There were also no knots in it. [Now they made two &#x003C; veils &#x003E; each and every year, and three hundred priests would immerse it (in a ritual bath).] How did they immerse it? All the priests went up and immersed it. Then they went up and spread it out within the <italic>hel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn759">37</xref></sup> After Moses had made the veil which was &#x003C;to be&#x003E; located before the Ark, &#x003C;it was&#x003E; after that he told Bezalel to make the Ark.</p>
<p>You find that whatever was in the Tabernacle was made in the proper order.<sup><xref rid="fn760">38</xref></sup> First he made the boards and joined them.<sup><xref rid="fn761">39</xref></sup> Then after that he made tent sheets, which he stretched out over them, as stated (in Exod. 26:7) <small>THEN YOU SHALL MAKE TENT SHEETS OF GOATS</small>&#x2019; <small>HAIR</small>. Then after that he made the veil which was placed before the Ark. Then after that he made the Ark. Then after that he made the gold Mercy Seat on top of the Ark. R. Eleazar b. R. Jose said: I have seen it in Rome, and there were several drops of blood on it. I asked them what this blood was upon the Mercy Seat. They said: &#x003C;It comes &#x003E; from the blood of the Day of Atonement (rt.: <small>KPR</small>), when the High Priest came in and sprinkled it. Why is it named a Mercy Seat (rt.: <small>KPR</small>)? Because he atoned (rt.: <small>KPR</small>) &#x003C; there &#x003E; for the sins of Israel. Then after that he made the table on which the shewbread lay. Then after that he made the menorah which shed light over the table. See, he made it like an &#x003C;ordered&#x003E; array<sup><xref rid="fn762">40</xref></sup> of kings. Therefore (in Exod. 37:1): <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE &#x003C;THE ARK</small>&#x003E;.</p>
<title>10.11 Exodus 37:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Exod. 37:1:) <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE</small>.] Did Bezalel make them by himself, since it says each and every time: <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn763">41</xref></sup> It is simply because he put his whole heart into the work of the Tabernacle. Therefore, the Holy One did not deprive him of his reward, and proclaimed him on each occasion: <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE</small>. There is also a similar instance (in Ezra 10:15): <small>ONLY JONATHAN BEN ASAHEL AND JAHZEIAH BEN TIKVAH REMAINED FOR THIS PURPOSE, WITH MESHULLAM AND SHABBETHAI THE LEVITES HELPING THEM</small>. The text proclaims Jonathan because he put his heart into it. Here also &#x003C;the name is proclaimed &#x003E; (in Exod. 37:1): <small>THEN BEZALEL MADE</small>.</p>
<p>The Holy One said: You have made me sheets of goats&#x2019; hair for the tent on the Tabernacle. When you came out of Egypt, I brought a cloud and it became a shield over you. Even though you rebel (<italic>pore&#x2018;im</italic>) against me, I am rewarding (<italic>porea</italic>&#x2018;) you in the world to come, as stated (in Is. 4:5): <small>FOR THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE WHOLE SITE OF MOUNT ZION AND OVER ITS ASSEMBLY A CLOUD &#x003C;AND SMOKE&#x003E; BY DAY &#x003C;AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT</small>&#x003E;. You made me a Mercy Seat; I am pardoning (<small>KPR</small>) you for all your sins, as stated (in Ezek. 16:63): <small>WHEN I FORGIVE YOU</small>&#x2026;. You made me the ark (&#x2018;<small>RWN</small>); by your life I am enlightening (rt.: &#x2018;<small>WR</small>) you, as stated (in Is. 30:26): <small>MOREOVER, THE LIGHT OF THE MOON SHALL BE AS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN</small>&#x2026;. It also says (in Ps. 97:11): <small>LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS</small>&#x2026;.</p>

<title>Chapter 11 Exodus, Parashah XI: <italic>Pequde</italic></title>
<title>11.1 Exodus 38:21ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 28:20): <small>A FAITHFUL PERSON WILL RECEIVE MANY BLESSINGS</small>, [<small>BUT ONE WHO HASTENS TO BECOME RICH WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED</small>]. In the case of whoever is faithful, you find that the Holy One brings blessings through him; but whoever is unfaithful <small>AND HASTENS TO BECOME RICH WILL NOT GO UNPUNISHED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn764">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:20): <small>A FAITHFUL PERSON WILL RECEIVE MANY BLESSINGS</small>. This was Moses. Because of all the things that were done, he was remembered for himself; and they were blessed through him. Why? Because he was faithful. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT ONE WHO HASTENS TO BECOME RICH</small>. This was Korah, who was a Levite and wanted to obtain the high priesthood as well.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:20): <small>A FAITHFUL PERSON WILL RECEIVE MANY BLESSINGS</small>. This was Moses, who became sole treasurer; and although he alone was treasurer, he summoned others and rendered an accounting through them. It is so stated (in Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>.</p>
<title>11.2 Exodus 38:21ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>]. This text is related (to II Kings 12:16 [15]): <small>AND THEY DID NOT ASK AN ACCOUNTING FROM THE ONES INTO WHOSE HANDS THEY GAVE THE MONEY TO GIVE TO THOSE DOING THE WORK, BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING IN GOOD FAITH</small>. This is the generation of King Joash, which did act in good faith.<sup><xref rid="fn765">2</xref></sup> Our masters have taught: Whoever entered the Temple treasury to make a withdrawal did not enter in a hemmed tunic<sup><xref rid="fn766">3</xref></sup> or with a money girdle,<sup><xref rid="fn767">4</xref></sup> for if he became wealthy, they would say he became rich from what belonged to the Temple treasury.<sup><xref rid="fn768">5</xref></sup> Thus a person must satisfy the people just as he satisfies Heaven, as stated (in Numb. 32:22): <small>SO YOU SHALL BE BLAMELESS BEFORE THE LORD AND BEFORE ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. Now Moses was sole treasurer over the business of the Tabernacle. When the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 25:8): <small>MAKE ME A SANCTUARY</small>, Moses said to all the children of Israel (in Exod. 35:4&#x2013;5): <small>THIS IS THE THING WHICH THE LORD HAS COMMANDED &#x003C;&#x2026;:&#x003E; TAKE FROM AMONG YOU AN OFFERING</small>&#x2026;. R. Johanan said: In two mornings they brought &#x003C; building materials &#x003E; for the whole Tabernacle, so that they had more than enough.<sup><xref rid="fn769">6</xref></sup> (Exod. 36:6&#x2013;7:) <small>THEN MOSES COMMANDED, AND THEY HAD IT PROCLAIMED THROUGHOUT THE CAMP&#x2026;: FOR THEY HAD SUFFICIENT SUPPLIES</small>&#x2026;. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, We have done all the work for the Tabernacle, and we have more than enough. What shall we do with the surplus? He said to them: Go and make a tabernacle for the commandments. He went and made a tabernacle for the commandments. When he came to give the accounting, he said to them (i.e., to the Israelites) thus and so was spent for the &#x003C;actual&#x003E; Tabernacle, and with the rest I made a tabernacle for the testimony. It is so stated (in Exod. 38:21): <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE, THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TABERNACLE</small> (<small>M<italic>Sh</italic>KN</small>), <small>TABERNACLE</small> (<small>M<italic>Sh</italic>KN</small>), &#x003C;with the word repeated&#x003E; two times?<sup><xref rid="fn770">7</xref></sup> R. &#x007B;Simeon&#x007D; [Samuel] said: It was mortgaged (<small>NTM<italic>Sh</italic>KN</small>) two times for them.<sup><xref rid="fn771">8</xref></sup> R. Ishmael said: This &#x003C; usage &#x003E; is a sign<sup><xref rid="fn772">9</xref></sup> for all who come into the world that there is only forgiveness for Israel alone.<sup><xref rid="fn773">10</xref></sup> <small>THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small> is testimony for all who come into the world that the Holy One has been reconciled with Israel. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who took a wife and loved her excessively. He became angry with her and left her. Her woman neighbors said to her: He will not return to you. After some days the king was reconciled to her and entered his palace<sup><xref rid="fn774">11</xref></sup> [with her], where he ate and drank. Now her neighbors would not believe that he had been reconciled to her; but when there was an aroma in the heavens over her, they immediately knew that the king had been reconciled to her. Similarly the Holy One loved Israel, brought them to Mount Sinai, gave them the Torah, and called them kings (in Exod. 19:6). At the end of forty days they made the calf and said (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. In that hour the peoples of the world said: The Holy One will never again be reconciled to them. When Moses arose and prayed for them, the Holy One said to him (in Numb. 14:20): <small>I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn775">12</xref></sup> And not only that but I have had my Divine Presence dwell over them and among them, so that everyone may know that I have forgiven them. It is so stated (in Exod. 25:8): <small>AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY</small> [<small>THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG YOU</small>].</p>
<title>11.3 Exodus 38:21ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>. When Hadrian entered the Holy of Holies of the Temple, he became arrogant there and blasphemed the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn776">13</xref></sup> R. Hiyya bar Abba said: David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, may you consider &#x003C;the matter &#x003E; for yourself in this way: If they had been able to make ladders and ascend on high (<italic>lema&#x2019;la</italic>), they would have ascended &#x003C; against you&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 74:5): <small>LET HIM APPEAR AS ONE WHO WIELDS AXES UPWARD</small> (<italic>lema&#x2019;la</italic>) <small>IN A THICKET OF WOOD</small>. However, because they were unable, they left you and came back against us, as stated (in Ps. 79:1): <small>O GOD, THE GENTILES HAVE COME AGAINST YOUR INHERITANCE</small> (i.e., against Israel); <small>THEY HAVE DEFILED YOUR HOLY TEMPLE</small>.</p>
<title>11.4 Exodus 38:21ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>. Whatever Moses did he did through others, as stated (ibid.): <small>&#x003C;THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE, THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY, WHICH WERE DRAWN UP AT MOSES</small>&#x2019; <small>BIDDING,&#x003E; THE WORK OF THE LEVITES BY MEANS OF ITHAMAR &#x003C;BEN AARON</small> &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn777">14</xref></sup> He only did &#x003C;the accounting &#x003E; after the work on the Tabernacle was finished. He said to them: Come and let me make an accounting before you. All Israel gathered while he sat and made calculations. He forgot one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, of which he had made hooks for the pillars.<sup><xref rid="fn778">15</xref></sup> He said to them (in vs. 28): <small>AND OF THE ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-FIVE &#x003C; SHEKELS</small> &#x003E; [<small>HE</small> (Ithamar) <small>MADE HOOKS FOR THE PILLARS</small>]. At that time Israel was mollified<sup><xref rid="fn779">16</xref></sup> over the building of the Tabernacle. And who brought it about for him? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because he &#x003C; himself&#x003E; sat down and mollified them. (Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>. But why did he make an accounting with them when the Holy One trusted him? It is so stated (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT MOSES</small>; [<small>HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE</small>]. Yet Moses said: Come and make an accounting with me. It was simply that Moses had heard Israel speaking behind his back, as stated &#x007B;in Exod. 33:9): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN MOSES WOULD GO</small> [<small>TO THE TENT</small>], <small>THE PILLAR OF CLOUD WOULD DESCEND</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND THE LORD WOULD SPEAK WITH MOSES</small>.&#x007D; [(in Exod. 33:8): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN MOSES WOULD GO OUT UNTO THE TENT, &#x003C;ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE</small>&#x003E;&#x2026; <small>AND STARE AFTER MOSES</small>.] And what were they saying?<sup><xref rid="fn780">17</xref></sup> R. Isaac says: They were saying in his favor: Blessed is she who bore this man. All his days the Holy One speaks with him; all his days he genuinely belongs to the Holy One. (Exod. 33:8:) <small>&#x003C;ALL THE PEOPLE WOULD RISE</small> &#x2026;&#x003E; <small>AND STARE AFTER MOSES</small>. But R. Hama said: They were saying to his shame: Look at the &#x003C;fat&#x003E; neck; look at the &#x003C;fat&#x003E; thighs. Moses is eating from what belongs to Jews and drinking from what belongs to Jews, for everything he possesses comes from the Jews. Then an associate of his would reply: Would you not want a person in charge of the work on the Tabernacle to be wealthy? As soon as Moses heard that, he said to them: By your life, after the Tabernacle is finished, I am making an accounting with you. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>11.5 Exodus 38:21ff, Part V</title>
<p>[Exod. 38:21:) <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE, THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>THE TESTIMONY</small>? This is the Torah in which they would labor.<sup><xref rid="fn781">18</xref></sup> The Holy One said to them: By virtue of the Torah and by virtue of the offerings, I am saving you from Gehinnom. Also in the case of their father Abraham, the Holy One showed him the Torah, the offerings, Gehinnom, and the empires (all of which were revealed to him in the theophany of Gen. 15):<sup><xref rid="fn782">19</xref></sup> Torah (in Gen. 15:17): <small>AND A FLAMING TORCH</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn783">20</xref></sup> the offerings (in vs. 9): <small>AND HE SAID UNTO HIM: BRING ME A THREE-YEAR-OLD HEIFER</small>; Gehinnom (in vs. 17): <small>A SMOKING OVEN</small>; the empires (in vs. 12): <small>AND LO, A GREAT DARK DREAD &#x003C;FELL UPON HIM</small>&#x003E;. The Holy One said to him: As long as your children are engaged in &#x003C;the first&#x003E; two, they shall be saved from &#x003C;the other &#x003E; two. As long as they are engaged in the Torah and the offerings, they shall be saved from Gehinnom and from the empires. Now the Temple is going to be destroyed, and the offerings shall cease. Therefore, how do you say that your children should be enslaved? By Gehinnom or by the empires? Abraham chose the empires. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, Let them be enslaved by the empires, and let not one of them go down into Gehinnom. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:30): <small>&#x003C;HOW SHOULD ONE HAVE ROUTED A THOUSAND, OR TWO PUT TEN THOUSAND TO FLIGHT, &#x003E; UNLESS THEIR ROCK HAD SOLD THEM</small>? Now <small>THEIR ROCK</small> can only be their father Abraham, since it is stated (in Is. 51:1): <small>LOOK UNTO THE ROCK OUT OF WHICH YOU WERE HEWN</small>. (Deut. 32:30, cont.:) <small>AND THE LORD HAD GIVEN THEM UP</small>, because the Holy One had concurred with him (i.e., with Abraham in his decision to be enslaved by the empires). R. Hanina said: Abraham was standing in bewilderment, and did not know what to choose. The Holy One said to him: Make the decision. At that time the Holy One gave him a hint to choose the empires.<sup><xref rid="fn784">21</xref></sup> Ergo (in Exod. 38:21): <small>THESE ARE THE RECORDS OF THE TABERNACLE &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; OF THE TESTIMONY</small>, &#x003C;a testimony that&#x003E; as long as Israel was engaged in the Torah and in the offerings, they would not go down into Gehinnom. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you have been enslaved in the hands of empires, but in the world to come I will save you from Gehinnom by virtue of the Torah, which is called a fire, as stated (in Deut. 33:2): <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND THERE A FIERY LAW</small> (<italic>dat</italic>) <small>FOR THEM</small>. So the fire (of Torah) puts out the fire (of Gehinnom), as stated (in Is. 43:2): <small>WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE FIRE, YOU SHALL NOT BE SCORCHED, NEITHER SHALL THE FLAME BURN YOU</small>.</p>
<title>11.6 Exodus 39:33ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Exod. 39:33:) <small>AND THEY BROUGHT THE TABERNACLE UNTO MOSES</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 31:19 [18]): <small>LET LYING LIPS BE DUMB THAT SPEAK HAUGHTILY AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. &#x003C;The verse &#x003E; speaks about Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn785">22</xref></sup> When the Holy One told him to make [a tabernacle], he immediately told them (in Exod. 35:5): <small>TAKE FROM AMONG YOU AN OFFERING FOR THE LORD</small>. So Moses was occupied with the Tabernacle. R. Hanina said: He was occupied with the Tabernacle for six months. For three months they made it, and for three months they had it folded away. Nevertheless they murmured about it and said: See, the Tabernacle is made. Did he not say that he would have his Divine Presence dwell with us? But the Holy One had intended the Tabernacle to go up in the month that our father Abraham had been told the good news about Isaac. He only acted when the month arrived.<sup><xref rid="fn786">23</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in Exod. 40:2): <small>ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FIRST MONTH</small> [<small>YOU SHALL SET UP THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small>]. At that time the Holy One said (in Ps. 31:19 [18]): <small>LET LYING LIPS BE DUMB THAT SPEAK HAUGHTILY AGAINST THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. The very ones who were murmuring against the Tabernacle, began to carry it, with each and every one of them joining in the work, as stated (in Exod. 39:33): <small>AND THEY BROUGHT THE TABERNACLE UNTO MOSES</small>.</p>
<title>11.7 Exodus 39:33ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Exod. 39:33:) <small>AND THEY BROUGHT THE TABERNACLE UNTO MOSES</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 31:25): &#x007B;<small>MAJESTY</small>&#x007D; [<small>STRENGTH</small>] <small>AND SPLENDOR ARE HER CLOTHING; AND YOU WILL LAUGH</small><sup><xref rid="fn787">24</xref></sup> <small>AT THE LATTER DAY</small>. There is a story about R. Abbahu.<sup><xref rid="fn788">25</xref></sup> When he was departing this world, the Holy One showed him his reward as it was prepared for him in the world to come. He made thirteen rivers of balsam<sup><xref rid="fn789">26</xref></sup> pass before him. When he saw them, he was astonished and said: Are all these for Abbahu? Then he read to himself the verse (Is. 49:4): <small>I HAVE USED UP MY STRENGTH FOR A VOID AND VANITY; SURELY MY JUDGEMENT IS WITH THE LORD AND MY RECOMPENSE IS WITH MY GOD</small>. [Ergo (Prov. 31:25): <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE LATTER DAY</small>.] Zavday ben Levi, Levi ben Paytam,<sup><xref rid="fn790">27</xref></sup> and R. Judah ben Levi, each of them individually, [cited] a verse at the time of their departure from the world.<sup><xref rid="fn791">28</xref></sup> One cited (Ps. 32:6): <small>THEREFORE LET EVERY SAINT PRAY UNTO YOU &#x003C;IN ANTICIPATION OF THE TIME OF DISCOVERY</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. The next cited (Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD &#x003C;WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>&#x003E;. And the other cited (Ps. 5:12 [11]): <small>BUT LET ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN YOU REJOICE. &#x003C;LET THEM EVER SING FOR JOY, AND YOU SHALL SHELTER THEM</small>.&#x003E; Ergo, at the time of their departure from the world, the Holy One showed them their reward. Ben &#x2018;Azzay said (Ps. 116:15): <small>PRECIOUS IN THE EYES OF THE LORD IS THE DEATH OF HIS SAINTS</small>. When does the Holy One show his righteous ones the honor which he has prepared for them? Near their death. Ergo (in Prov. 31:25): <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE LATTER DAY</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn792">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a story about a certain disciple of R. Simeon who went abroad and came back wealthy. When the &#x003C;other&#x003E; disciples saw him, they &#x003C;also&#x003E; wanted to go abroad. R. Simeon knew &#x003C; about the situation &#x003E; and brought them out to a valley which was near his native town of Meron. Then he prayed to the Holy One, and the valley was filled with gold dinars. He said to them, whoever wants to take &#x003C;some&#x003E; may take &#x003C;some&#x003E;. But they knew that whoever took &#x003C;some&#x003E; then was taking it out of his portion in the world to come, for the reward &#x003C;of Torah&#x003E; is not in this world but in the world to come. Ergo (in Prov. 31:25): <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE LATTER DAY</small>.</p>
<p>There is a story about R. Simeon ben Halafta, that he came &#x003C;home&#x003E; on Sabbath eve and did not have anything to eat.<sup><xref rid="fn793">30</xref></sup> On Sabbath eve at nightfall he went outside of the city and prayed to the Holy One. Immediately a precious stone was given to him from heaven. So he came in, gave it to the money-changer, and provided for the Sabbath. Then he sat down to eat on the Sabbath night. His wife said to him: Where did these &#x003C; provisions &#x003E; come from? He said to her: From what the Holy One supplied. She said to him: If you do not tell me, I am not tasting anything until you will tell me. He said to her: Thus and so is what happened: I prayed, a precious stone was given to me from heaven, and these things came from that. She said to him: I am not tasting anything until you give me your word that you will return it on the evening after the Sabbath. He said to her: Why? She said to him: In the future &#x003C; life &#x003E; you will come with your friends; and they will take more, with you taking less than they. Why? Because there is no reward for Torah except in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 31:25): <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE LATTER DAY</small>. As soon as the Sabbath had gone, he arose and returned it. Immediately it was taken from him.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 31:25): <small>STRENGTH AND SPLENDOR ARE HER CLOTHING</small>. This is Moses (in Exod. 34:29): <small>MOSES DID NOT KNOW</small> [<small>THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE WAS SHINING</small>]. (Prov. 31:25, cont.:) <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH</small>. These words are &#x003C;in reference to incident of&#x003E; the mockers of Israel, when they murmured after Moses saying: Is it possible for the Divine Presence to come to rest upon the handiwork of Moses? He did not act. However, when the Holy One told him to erect the Tabernacle, he began to laugh at them. (Prov. 31:25): <small>AND YOU WILL LAUGH AT THE LATTER DAY</small>.</p>
<title>11.8 Exodus 39:33ff, Part III</title>
<p>How many were skilled but could not erect the Tabernacle?<sup><xref rid="fn794">31</xref></sup> Solomon said (in Prov. 31:29): <small>MANY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE VALIANTLY, &#x003C;BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL</small>&#x003E;. Why? Because they built the Tabernacle but did not know how to set it up. Each and everyone took his work and went to Moses. Each and every one would say: Here is my hook. Here is my board. Here is my bolt. But the Holy Spirit rested upon Moses, and he erected the tabernacle. Still you should not say &#x003C;that&#x003E; Moses &#x003C;did it&#x003E;. Rather The Tabernacle arose by itself, as stated (in Exod. 40:17): <small>THE TABERNACLE WAS ERECTED</small>. And you should not speak of the Tabernacle &#x003C; alone being automatically erected &#x003E;, but also of the Universal House (i.e., the Temple).<sup><xref rid="fn795">32</xref></sup> Had it not been for the Holy One helping, neither Solomon nor all Israel would have built it. Where is it shown? Where David says so (in Ps. 127:1): <small>UNLESS THE LORD BUILDS THE HOUSE</small>, [<small>THE BUILDERS</small>&#x2019; <small>LABOR ON IT IN VAIN</small>]. Therefore, the Tabernacle was erected through work of miracles. As soon as that Tabernacle was erected, all Israel began to rejoice, as stated (in Cant. 3:11): <small>O DAUGHTERS OF ZION, GO FORTH AND GAZE AT KING SOLOMON</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>LM</small>), &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; at the king to whom peace (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>LM</small>) belongs, i.e., the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. (Ibid., cont.:) [<small>IN THE CROWN WITH WHICH HIS MOTHER CROWNED HIM</small>, for the &#x003C; verse here&#x003E; is calling the Tabernacle a crown. Just as this crown is described, so was the Tabernacle described (e.g., in Exod. 36:35): <small>BLUE AND PURPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn796">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Cant. 3:11): <small>IN THE CROWN WITH WHICH HIS MOTHER CROWNED HIM</small>. R. Isaac said: I have searched through every bit of the whole Scripture, and not found where Bathsheba made a crown for her son Solomon; yet it says (ibid): <small>IN THE CROWN WITH WHICH HIS MOTHER CROWNED HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn797">34</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Johay questioned R. Eleazar bar Jose. He said to him: Is it possible that you heard from your father (R. Jose ben Halafta) what the meaning is of (Cant. 3:11): <small>IN THE CROWN WITH WHICH HIS MOTHER CROWNED HIM</small>? He said to him: Daddy said this: It is comparable to a king who had an only daughter, and loved her excessively. He persisted in his love for her until he called her [my sister. He persisted &#x003C; further &#x003E; in his love for her until he called her] my mother. So the Holy One loved Israel and called them, my daughter, as stated (in Ps. 45:11 [10]): <small>HEAR, O DAUGHTER, TAKE NOTE</small>. He persisted until he called them, my sister, as stated (in Cant. 5:2): <small>MY SISTER, MY BELOVED</small>. He persisted &#x003C;further&#x003E; until he called them, my mother, as stated (in Is. 51:4): <small>HEARKEN UNTO ME, MY PEOPLE, AND &#x003C;GIVE EAR UNTO ME,&#x003E; MY NATION</small> (<small>L&#x2019;WMY</small>)&#x2026;. <small>MY MOTHER</small> (<small><italic>L&#x2019;MY</italic></small>) is what is &#x003C;actually&#x003E; written.<sup><xref rid="fn798">35</xref></sup> R.

<p>(Ps. 48:3 [2]): <small>&#x003C;BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE&#x003E;, THE JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &#x003C;EVEN MOUNT ZION</small>&#x003E;. R.

<title>Chapter 1 Leviticus, Parashah I: <italic>Wayyiqra</italic></title>
<title>1.1 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES &#x003C;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 103:20): <small>BLESS THE LORD, O HIS MESSENGERS</small><sup><xref rid="fn806">1</xref></sup> <small>OF HIS, MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn807">2</xref></sup> These are the prophets, since they are called messengers where it is stated (in Numb. 20:16): <small>AND HE SENT A MESSENGER</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>WHO BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn808">3</xref></sup> So also (in II Chron. 36:16): <small>BUT THEY MOCKED THE MESSENGERS</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akhim</italic>) <small>OF GOD, &#x003C;DISDAINED HIS WORDS, AND TAUNTED HIS PROPHETS</small>,&#x003E;&#x2026;. R. Huna said in the name of R. Aha: These &#x003C;messengers&#x003E; are Israel, since it says (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD, HEARKENING TO THE VOICE OF HIS WORD</small>, in &#x003C;reference to the fact&#x003E; that they &#x003C;were the ones who&#x003E; had put fulfilling ahead of hearkening.<sup><xref rid="fn809">4</xref></sup> R. Isaac the Smith said: These are those who observe the Sabbatical year. So why were they called <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small>? When &#x003C;such a one&#x003E; sees his field abandoned, his trees abandoned, his fences breached, and sees his fruit trees eaten, he suppresses his drive (like one mighty in strength) and does not speak. Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Avot</italic> 4:1): <small>AND WHO IS MIGHTY? ONE WHO SUBDUES HIS DRIVE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn810">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Tanhum ben Hanila&#x2019;i says: (Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small>. This is Moses because no one is as <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small> as Moses. When Israel stood before Mount Sinai, they were not capable of hearing the divinely spoken word, as stated (in Deut. 5:22 [25]): <small>IF WE CONTINUE HEARING THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD ANY LONGER, WE SHALL DIE</small>. But Moses was not harmed, &#x003C;an exception made &#x003E; in order to teach you that the great ones are more righteous than the ministering angels, since the ministering angels are not able to hear his voice. Rather they stand with excitement and dismay, while the righteous are able to hear his voice. It is so stated (in Joel 2:11): <small>THE LORD SHOUTS ALOUD BEFORE HIS ARMY, FOR HIS HOST IS VERY GREAT</small>, &#x007B;<small>IF MIGHT &#x003C;COMES TO&#x003E; THE ONES WHO FULFILL</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR MIGHTY IS THE ONE WHO FULFILLS</small>] <small>HIS WORD. HIS HOST</small> denotes angels, since it is stated (re angels in Gen. 32:3 [2]): <small>THIS IS GOD&#x2019;S HOST</small>. And so it says (in Dan. 7:10): <small>THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS MINISTERED TO HIM</small>. And who among them are the strongest? The righteous, of whom it is stated (in Joel 2:11): &#x007B;<small>IF MIGHT &#x003C;COMES TO&#x003E; THE ONES WHO FULFILL</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR MIGHTY IS THE ONE WHO FULFILLS</small>] <small>HIS WORD</small>, i.e., a righteous person who does his bidding. And who is this? This is Moses, to whom the [Holy One] said: Make a tabernacle. So he was hurried and made it. Then he stood alone outside, because he was afraid to enter the Tent of Meeting, as stated (in Exod. 40:35, 38): <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING</small>&#x2026;. <small>FOR THE CLOUD OF THE LORD RESTED UPON THE TABERNACLE</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: It is not right for Moses, since he fretted over the Tabernacle, to stand outside while I stand inside; so look, I am calling upon him to enter. It is therefore written (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. Look at the mighty strength of the righteous, in that they are able to hear his voice&#x0021; So also it is written concerning Samuel (in I Sam. 3:10): <small>THEN THE LORD CAME, AND STOOD THERE, AND HE CALLED AS AT OTHER TIMES: SAMUEL, SAMUEL</small>. [<small>SO SAMUEL SAID: SPEAK, FOR YOUR SERVANT IS LISTENING</small>.] Therefore David has said (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD, HEARKENING TO THE VOICE OF HIS WORD</small>. Now if you say that, when he spoke with Moses, he spoke in a low voice, &#x003C;and&#x003E; for that reason he was able to hear, he only spoke in the voice &#x003C;used in&#x003E; the giving of Torah. &#x003C;That was&#x003E; when they heard his voice and were dying at the first utterance. It is so stated (in Deut. 5:22 [25]): <small>IF WE CONTINUE &#x003C;HEARING THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD ANY LONGER, WE SHALL DIE</small>&#x003E;. And so it says (in Cant. 5:6): <small>MY SOUL DEPARTED WHEN HE SPOKE</small>. And where is it shown that he spoke with the voice &#x003C;used in&#x003E; the giving of Torah? Where it says so (in Ps. 29:4&#x2013;5): <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD HAS POWER; THE VOICE OF THE LORD HAS MAJESTY</small>; [<small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS CEDARS</small>]. It also says so (in Numb. 7:89): <small>WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH HIM, HE WOULD HEAR THE VOICE SPEAKING UNTO HIM</small>, the voice which he heard in the giving of Torah. &#x007B;(Ps. 29:5:) <small>THE VOICE OF THE LORD BREAKS CEDARS</small>.&#x007D; He also spoke thus for each and every utterance and for each and every saying. Perhaps you will say that Israel heard the voice from outside.<sup><xref rid="fn811">6</xref></sup> The text (of Numb. 7:89) reads: <small>HE WOULD HEAR</small> [<small>THE VOICE</small>]. He heard the voice alone. But since he spoke in a loud voice, why did they not hear? Because the Holy One decreed over the utterance, that it would go forth and come to Moses. So the Holy One made a path for it by which the utterance went forth until it reached Moses, and it was not heard here and there. It is so stated (in Job 28:25): <small>TO FIX A WEIGHT FOR THE WIND</small>. Thus, when each saying went forth from the mouth of the Holy One, [every one had a &#x003C; fixed &#x003E; weight]. And so it says (in Job 28:26): <small>AND A WAY FOR THE THUNDER OF VOICES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn812">7</xref></sup> in that the Holy One made a way for that voice, because it was going forth to Moses alone. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>. It was heard by him and not by another. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 103:20): <small>MIGHTY IN STRENGTH WHO FULFILL HIS WORD</small>.</p>
<title>1.2 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. <bold>1:1:)</bold> <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES &#x003C;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>&#x003E;. This text is related (to Prov. 25:7): <small>FOR IT IS BETTER THAT YOU BE TOLD: COME UP HERE, THAN THAT YOU BE PUT DOWN BEFORE A PRINCE, WHOM YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN</small>. R. Tanhum says: Keep two or three places distance from your &#x003C; rightful &#x003E; place so that they will say to you: Come up higher.<sup><xref rid="fn813">8</xref></sup> So do not come up, lest they tell you: Go down. R. Tanhuma began (with Prov. 20:15): <small>THERE IS GOLD AND A MULTITUDE OF JEWELS, BUT LIPS WITH KNOWLEDGE AREA PRECIOUS OBJECT</small>. The proverb says: If you lack knowledge, what do you possess? If you possess knowledge, what do you lack?<sup><xref rid="fn814">9</xref></sup> Even Moses did not ascend until the Holy One called him (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>.</p>
<title>1.3 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 1:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES &#x003C;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;: <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;: WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>.] Let our master instruct us: When the one who leads the prayers makes a mistake by not saying the benediction on the cursing of the heretics (<italic>minim</italic>), is it necessary to have him repeat &#x003C;the benediction&#x003E;?<sup><xref rid="fn815">10</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: When the one leading the prayers makes a mistake in any of the &#x003C;other&#x003E; benedictions, they do not have him repeat; &#x003C;if he does so&#x003E; in the &#x003C;twelfth&#x003E; benediction concerning the heretics, they force him to repeat it.<sup><xref rid="fn816">11</xref></sup> We suspect that he may be a heretic and therefore have him repeat, so that if there is a heretical side to him, he will be cursing himself with the community responding: Amen. So also &#x003C;do we treat&#x003E; whoever does not say &#x003C;benediction 14&#x003E;, &#x201C;Who builds Jerusalem,&#x201D; since they will suspect that he may be a Samaritan. R. Jose said: If a proselyte takes upon himself &#x003C;all&#x003E; the words of Torah except for one, they do not accept him.<sup><xref rid="fn817">12</xref></sup> And not only that, but &#x003C;the same rule applies&#x003E; even in the case of a single minute detail out of &#x003C;all&#x003E; the minute details in the Torah or out of the minute details from the scribes. R. Judah bar Shallum said: You find forty-eight times in the Torah where the Torah warns against &#x003C;harming&#x003E; the proselytes and, with reference to them, it warns against idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn818">13</xref></sup> The Holy One said: It is enough that he forsakes his idolatry and comes to you; therefore I am warning you about him, because I love him, as stated (in Deut. 10:18): <small>AND &#x003C;HE&#x003E; LOVES THE PROSELYTE</small><sup><xref rid="fn819">14</xref></sup> <small>IN GIVING HIM FOOD AND CLOTHING</small>.</p>
<title>1.4 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 29:23): <small>ONE&#x2019;S PRIDE WILL BRING HIM LOW, BUT THE LOW IN SPIRIT WILL OBTAIN HONOR</small>. Whenever anyone flees from authority, the authority will pursue him.<sup><xref rid="fn820">15</xref></sup> Saul fled from authority when he came to reign, as stated (in I Sam. 10:22): <small>SO THEY INQUIRED OF THE LORD AGAIN: HAS ANYONE ELSE COME</small> [<small>HERE</small>]? <small>AND THE LORD SAID: HERE HE IS HIDING AMONG THE BAGGAGE</small>. What does it (the word <small>BAGGAGE</small>) mean? When they came and brought him word of his kingship, he told them: I am not worthy of kingship. Rather inquire by means of Urim and Thummim whether I am worthy; and if not, leave me alone. Immediately (ibid.), <small>THEY INQUIRED OF THE LORD AGAIN</small> (i.e., this second time), &#x003C;and&#x003E; immediately he hid himself until they had inquired of Urim and Thummim. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID: HERE HE IS HIDING AMONG THE BAGGAGE</small> (literally: <small>INSTRUMENTS</small>). Thus have our masters taught: These instruments were Urim and Thummim. This man fled from authority, and it pursued him, as stated (in I Sam. 10:24): <small>DO YOU SEE THE ONE WHOM THE LORD HAS CHOSEN, THAT THERE IS NO ONE LIKE HIM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES</small>? But Abimelech ben Jerubbaal pursued authority, and it fled from him, as stated (in Jud. 9:1&#x2013;2, 23): <small>BUT ABIMELECH BEN JERUBBAAL WENT TO SHECHEM &#x003C;UNTO HIS MOTHER&#x2019;S BROTHERS &#x003E;&#x2026;, &#x003C;SAYING&#x003E;: PLEASE SPEAK IN THE EARS OF ALL THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM&#x2026;. THEN</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>GOD</small>] <small>SENT AN EVIL SPIRIT BETWEEN ABIMELECH &#x003C;AND THE CITIZENS OF SHECHEM</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<p>Moses also fled from authority when the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): &#x007B;<small>ARISE</small>&#x007D; [<small>COME</small>], <small>I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>&#x2026;. (Exod. 14:13): <small>BUT HE SAID: PRAY LORD, PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. R. Levi said: For seven days the Holy One prevailed upon Moses in the thornbush in order to send him,<sup><xref rid="fn821">16</xref></sup> and he was answering him: <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 4:10): <small>THEN MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: &#x003C;PRAY, LORD,&#x003E; I HAVE NEVER BEEN A MAN OF WORDS, EITHER IN THE PAST OR NOW THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN UNTO YOUR SERVANT, FOR I AM SLOW OF SPEECH AND SLOW OF TONGUE</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: By your life, in the end you shall go. When he did go, he said: (in Exod. 5:1): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD, THE GOD OF</small> &#x007B;<small>THE HEBREWS</small>&#x007D; [<small>ISRAEL</small>]: <small>&#x003C;LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. That wicked man said (in vs. 2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD, THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn822">17</xref></sup> Moses began to say: I have already fulfilled my mission. He went and sat down. The Holy One said to him: Are you sitting down? (Exod. 6:11:) <small>GO AND SPEAK UNTO PHARAOH KING OF EGYPT</small>. For each and every oracle (as in Exod. 7:15), <small>GO UNTO PHARAOH</small>. (Exod. 8:16 [20]:) <small>RISE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING</small>. &#x003C;These verses are&#x003E; to teach you that he fled from authority. In the end he led them forth, divided the sea for them, brought them into the desert, brought down the manna for them, brought up the well for them, brought over the quails for them, and made the Tabernacle. Then he said: From now on what is there for me to do? He got ready and sat down. The Holy One said to him: By your life, now you have a greater work than any that you have done, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; to teach my children clean and unclean, to enlighten them on how to offer sacrifice to me, as stated (in Lev. 1:1&#x2013;2): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; [<small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;: WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>.] Abimelech pursued authority and it fled from him, in fulfillment of what is stated (in Prov. 29:23): <small>ONE&#x2019;S PRIDE WILL BRING HIM LOW</small>. (Ibid., cont.: <small>BUT THE LOW IN SPIRIT WILL OBTAIN HONOR</small>. This is Moses, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 8:6 [5]): <small>FOR YOU HAVE MADE HIM A LITTLE LESS THAN DIVINE, AND CROWNED HIM WITH GLORY AND MAJESTY</small>.</p>
<title>1.5 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 89:20 [19]): <small>THEN YOU SPOKE TO YOUR SAINTS IN A VISION AND SAID: I HAVE CONFERRED HELP UPON ONE WHO IS MIGHTY; I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE</small>. Although the Holy One spoke with the first Adam and commanded him concerning the tree of knowledge, he was alone in the world. So also in the case of Noah, although he spoke with him, he &#x003C; alone &#x003E; was upright in his generations. And so it was in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were unique in the world. But in the case of Moses, how many righteous ones [were in the world]? Seventy elders, Bezalel, Uri, Aaron and his sons, and the &#x003C;tribal&#x003E; princes. Yet of them all he called only Moses. Ergo, it says (in Ps. 89:20 [19]): <small>I HAVE EXALTED ONE CHOSEN FROM THE PEOPLE</small>. This is Moses, [since it is written] (in Ps. 106:23): &#x003C;&#x2026;,&#x003E; <small>HAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN ONE</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;.</p>
<title>1.6 Leviticus 1:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 1:1:) <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>. From where [did he call him]?<sup><xref rid="fn823">18</xref></sup> From the Tent of Meeting. May his name be blessed forever, because he left the upper world and chose to dwell below in the Tabernacle out of love for Israel. Solomon said (in I Kings 8:27): <small>FOR WILL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; <small>GOD REALLY DWELL ON THE EARTH</small>? [<small>EVEN THE HEAVENS AND THE HEAVENS ABOVE THE HEAVENS CANNOT CONTAIN YOU, HOW MUCH LESS THIS HOUSE THAT I HAVE BUILT</small>&#x0021;] Is there a potter who yearns for vessels of clay? &#x003C;It is the Holy One&#x003E;, as it were, (in Jer. 10:16): <small>FOR HE HAS FORMED EVERYTHING</small>. However, out of love (according to Ps. 84:3 [2]): <small>MY SOUL LONGS FOR AND EVEN PINES FOR &#x003C;THE COURTS OF THE LORD</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. And so it says (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES &#x003C;AND SPOKE UNTO HIM FROM THE TENT OF MEETING</small>&#x003E;. Moses was great. See what is written (in Gen. 1:5). <small>AND GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY</small>. [There is a &#x201C;calling&#x201D; for the one (in Gen. 1:5), and there is a &#x201C;calling&#x201D; for the other (in Lev. 1:1). Who is greater, the captor or the captive? You must say: The captive.<sup><xref rid="fn824">19</xref></sup> See what is written. <small>AND GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY</small>.] Now there is no light but Torah, as stated (in Prov. 6:23): <small>FOR THE COMMANDMENT IS A LAMP, AND TORAH IS A LIGHT</small>. Moses captured the Torah, as stated (of him at Sinai in Ps. 68:19 [18]): <small>YOU ASCENDED ON HIGH; YOU CAPTURED</small> [<small>CAPTIVES</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to him: In this world I have made you head &#x003C;over all Israel &#x003E;;<sup><xref rid="fn825">20</xref></sup> but in the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn826">21</xref></sup> when the righteous come to receive their reward, you will come at the head of them all.

<title>1.8 Leviticus 4:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 4:1&#x2013;2:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: &#x003C;SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: WHEN A SOUL SINS &#x003C;BY MISTAKE</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us:<sup><xref rid="fn834">29</xref></sup> Is it right for one to enter the Temple mount with his staff or his money girdle?<sup><xref rid="fn835">30</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ber</italic>. 9:5): <small>ONE MAY NOT ENTER THE TEMPLE MOUNT WITH HIS STAFF, HIS MONEY GIRDLE, OR WITH DUST ON HIS FEET</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn836">31</xref></sup> lest he treat it with disrespect, even in its destruction. The Holy One said (in Lev. 26:2): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY: I AM THE LORD</small>. And what was the reason for comparing keeping the Sabbath with the Sanctuary? Thus did R. Hiyya the Great teach: Just as keeping the Sabbath is forever so is reverence for the Sanctuary forever. Now Solomon cried out (in Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>. Solomon was observing how the wicked subverted &#x003C;justice&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn837">32</xref></sup> in the Sanctuary. Solomon said: The place where the Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn838">33</xref></sup> sat to judge criminal law, [civil law,] decisions on scourgings, and decisions on clean and unclean, there they defiled it.<sup><xref rid="fn839">34</xref></sup> See what is written (in Jer. 39:3): <small>THEN ALL THE OFFICERS OF THE KING OF BABYLON CAME AND SAT IN THE MIDDLE GATE: NEGRAL-SAREZER, SAMGAR-NEBO, SARSECHIM THE RAB-SARIS, &#x003C;NERGAL-SAREZER THERAB-MAG</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. (Lam. 5:18:) <small>BECAUSE OF MOUNT ZION, WHICH LIES DESOLATE, THE JACKALS WALK OVER IT</small>. The Holy One said to him: You name those entering, but you do not name those leaving. (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>. (Lam. 2:20:) <small>SHOULD PRIEST AND PROPHET BE SLAIN IN THE SANCTUARY OF THE LORD</small>? Here is the blood of Zechariah shed on the stones,<sup><xref rid="fn840">35</xref></sup> as stated (in Ezek. 24:7): <small>FOR HER BLOOD WAS IN HER MIDST; SHE SET IT UPON BARE ROCK</small>.</p>
<title>1.9 Leviticus 4:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>. This is the central gate in which the Great Sanhedrin sat. <small>THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>. (Lam. 2:9:) <small>HER GATES HAVE SUNK INTO THE GROUND</small>. The Holy One said (in Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE, THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small> (<italic><small>RSh</small></italic>&#x2018;). There was one place for the Righteous One of the World, the Holy Temple, which was set apart for the Divine Presence. Then Manasseh wronged (rt.: <italic><small>RSh</small></italic>&#x2018;) it, and brought an image into its midst.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 3:16): <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small>, The Holy One said: I created the soul, and it is delivered into my hand, [as stated] (in Job 12:10): <small>IN WHOSE HAND IS EVERY LIVING SOUL</small>. And justice also is delivered into my hand, as stated (in Deut. 32:41): <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON JUSTICE</small>. But I did not deliver the soul to judgment. Rather &#x003C;it is in my hand&#x003E; that it might see what is fitting for it and not sin; yet it does sin. (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>, for the soul is placed next to the judgment.</p>
<title>1.10 Leviticus 4:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS &#x003C;BY MISTAKE</small>&#x003E;. This text is related (to Prov. 19:2): <small>ALSO, A SOUL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT GOOD</small>; [<small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>]. When someone sins, even by mistake, it is not a good sign<sup><xref rid="fn841">36</xref></sup> for him.<sup><xref rid="fn842">37</xref></sup> How so? There were two stores before him, one belonging to a star worshiper and one belonging to Israel. He entered the one belonging to the star worshiper. He entered deliberately. He is called a sinner, as stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn843">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rav Isaac bar Samuel bar Martha said: There were two ways before him, one long and one short. The short one was full of pebbles, but the long one did not have a pebble in it. He left the long one and went by the short one on the Sabbath. Concerning him it was stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. Our masters have taught (in <italic>Avot</italic>. 4:2): <small>ONE GOOD LEADS TO ANOTHER, AND ONE TRANSGRESSION LEADS TO ANOTHER</small>. A person should not worry about a sin which he commits by mistake, but rather that an opening has been made for him to sin, whether by mistake or deliberately. Moreover, one should not rejoice over a good deed which comes to him (for fulfillment), but rather that many good deeds are going to come to him.<sup><xref rid="fn844">39</xref></sup> Therefore, if one has sinned by mistake, this is not a good sign. How much the more so if he sins deliberately&#x0021; About him it has been stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. So also (in Prov. 6:16&#x2013;19): <small>SIX THINGS THE LORD HATES&#x2026;: HAUGHTY EYES, A LYING TONGUE,&#x2026; FEET QUICK TO RUN TO EVIL</small>, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; This refers to Ahab ben Kolaiah and Zedekiah ben Maaseiah (the false prophets of Jer. 29:21&#x2013;23), who sinned in Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn845">40</xref></sup> And that was not enough for them, but after they had gone into exile in Babylon, they added to their sin. And what had they done in Jerusalem? They were false prophets. Moreover, they did not forsake their trade in Babylon. Now they would pimp for each other. Ahab would go to visit &#x003C;one of&#x003E; the great ones in the kingdom and would say to him: I am so-and-so, a prophet. The Holy One has sent me to say something to your wife. Then he would say to him: Here she is before you. Go on in. When he was alone with her, he would say to her: The Holy One wants to raise up prophets from you. Simply go, have intercourse with Zedekiah, and give birth to prophets from him. So he would come and have intercourse with her. Then Zedekiah would similarly pimp for Ahab. And this was their trade for several years. Come and see how wicked they were. They gave themselves a reputation in Babylon for being great prophets. When some woman became pregnant and saw one of them, she would say to him, O Prophet, what is in my womb? A male or a female? He would say: A male. Then he would go to her neighbors and say: So-and-so will bear a female. If she bore a male, she would say: So-and-so, the prophet, told me. If it was a female, the neighbors would say: Thus did so-and-so, the prophet, tell us; but he did not want to worry you. Now they acted in this way until they came to Shemirah, the wife of Nebuchadnezzar. Zedekiah said to her. Thus says the Lord: Inform Ahab&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn846">41</xref></sup> What caused these wicked men to be burned? It was because they ran with their feet after transgressions. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 19:2): <small>AND ONE WHO HASTENS WITH THE FEET IS A SINNER</small>. Nevertheless (ibid.) <small>ALSO, A SOUL WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT GOOD</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses: Say unto Israel (in Lev. 4:2) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>.</p>
<title>1.11 Leviticus 4:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>. Is it the soul that sins? The Scripture verse (Eccl. 3:16) says: <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small> (<italic>tsedeq</italic>), <small>THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS. THE PLACE</small> is &#x003C;the source of&#x003E; the soul, which has been given out of righteousness (<italic>tsedeq</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; out of a place where there is no iniquity or sin.<sup><xref rid="fn847">42</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; it does sins, the Scripture verse (Lev. 4:2) cries out in surprise: <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small>?&#x0021; (Eccl. 3:16:) <small>TO THE PLACE OF JUSTICE</small> (<italic>tsedeq</italic>), <small>THITHER &#x003C;CAME&#x003E; WICKEDNESS</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To two children of Adam who sinned against the king. One was a country bumpkin, and one a person from the palace.<sup><xref rid="fn848">43</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; he saw that both of them had committed a single offense, he released the country bumpkin but rendered a &#x003C;guilty&#x003E; verdict<sup><xref rid="fn849">44</xref></sup> against the person from the palace. His palace people said to him: Both of them committed a single offense; &#x003C;yet&#x003E; you released the country bumpkin &#x003C;and&#x003E; gave a verdict against the person from the palace. He said to them: I released the country bumpkin because he did not know the laws<sup><xref rid="fn850">45</xref></sup> of the kingdom, but the person from the palace is with me every day and knows what the laws of the kingdom are. Now for the one close to me who sinned, [what verdict] will be pronounced against him? So also the body is a country bumpkin. (Gen. 2:7:) <small>THE LORD FORMED THE HUMAN</small> [<small>OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND</small>]. But the soul is a palace person from above. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND BLEW INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE</small>. Yet both of them sinned. Why? Because it impossible for the body to exist without the soul.<sup><xref rid="fn851">46</xref></sup> Thus, if there is no soul, there is no body, and if there is no body, there is no soul. So both of them sinned. (Ezek. 18:20:) <small>THE SOUL THAT SINS SHALL DIE</small>. Therefore the scripture verse (Lev. 4:2) cries out in surprise: <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE &#x003C;AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD&#x2019;S COMMANDMENTS</small> &#x003E;&#x0021; What is the significance of <small>BY MISTAKE</small> (rt.: <italic>Sh</italic><small>GG</small>) <small>AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD&#x2019;S COMMANDMENTS</small>? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; to teach you that, when anyone sins <small>BY MISTAKE</small>, [it is as if] one transgresses against <small>THE LORD&#x2019;S COMMANDMENTS</small>. And so it says (in Numb. 15:22): <small>AND WHEN YOU SIN UNINTENTIONALLY</small> (rt.: <italic>Sh</italic><small>GG</small>) <small>AND DO NOT FULFILL ALL THESE COMMANDMENTS</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn852">47</xref></sup> [So also David has said (in Ps. 19:13&#x2013;14 [12&#x2013;13]): <small>WHO CAN DISCERN MISTAKES? CLEANSE ME FROM HIDDEN FAULTS</small>]. <small>ALSO RESTRAIN YOUR SERVANT FROM WILLFUL SINS&#x2026;, AND I SHALL BE CLEAN OF GREAT TRANSGRESSION</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; from the great sin which I have committed. But if you do so act (Ps. 19:15 [14]:), <small>LET THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH &#x003C;AND THE MEDITATIONS OF MY HEART&#x003E; BE ACCEPTABLE &#x003C;BEFORE YOU</small>&#x003E;. From here you learn that everyone who sins, even by mistake, is called a sinner. Our masters have said: A mistake in study is accounted as willful sin. It is therefore written (in Lev. 4:2:) <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS</small>. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; because it is from above that &#x201C;a person (<italic>adam</italic>)&#x201D; is not written here.</p>
<title>1.12 Leviticus 4:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>In the world to come the Holy One will bring in the soul and say to it: Why have you transgressed against the commandments? Then it will say: The body transgressed against the commandments. From the day that I left it, have I ever sinned? &#x003C;Then&#x003E; he will go back and say to the body: For what reason did you transgress the commandments? It will say to him: The soul sinned. Since the soul left me, have I ever sinned? What will the Holy One do? He will bring them both in and judge them as one. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard in which were grapes, figs, pomegranates, and early-ripening figs.<sup><xref rid="fn853">48</xref></sup> The king said (to himself): If I post someone there who can see and walk, he will eat the early-ripening figs for himself. He &#x003C;therefore&#x003E; posted two guards, one lame and one blind. They stayed and watched the orchard. They smelled the early-ripening figs. The lame one said to the blind one: I see lovely early-ripening figs in the orchard. Come and give me a ride, so we can get them and eat them. The lame one rode upon the back of the blind one, so that he got them, and they ate them. One day the king came. He wanted the early-ripening figs, but he did not find any. He said to the blind one: Did you eat them? He said to him: Do I have any eyes? He said to the lame one: Have you eaten them? He said: Do I have any feet? He &#x003C; therefore &#x003E; mounted the lame person on the blind person&#x2019;s back and judged them as one. So the Holy One will take a spirit and toss it into a body, as stated (in Ps. 50:4): <small>HE SUMMONED THE HEAVENS ABOVE</small>, i.e., the soul; (ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE EARTH TO JUDGE HIS PEOPLE</small>, i.e., the body. So David foresaw how the Holy One would judge his creatures. He began to seek mercy for his soul. He said: Master of the World, when you judge your creatures, do not judge me like them. [(Ps. 143:2): <small>AND DO NOT ENTER INTO JUDGMENT WITH YOUR SERVANT, FOR NO ONE LIVING SHALL BE JUSTIFIED BEFORE YOU</small>.] Rather act justly with me, as stated (in Ps. 17:15): <small>AS FOR ME, I WILL BEHOLD YOUR FACE IN JUSTICE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world because the evil drive rules in them.<sup><xref rid="fn854">49</xref></sup> You have sinned, but in the world to come I will root it out from you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.13 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 5:1:) <small>AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C;IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small>&#x003E;. This text is related (to Eccl. 5:1 [2]): <small>DO NOT BE RASH WITH YOUR MOUTH, AND LET NOT YOUR HEART HASTEN TO BRING FORTH A WORD BEFORE GOD</small>. These &#x003C; words refer to&#x003E; the children of Adam who vilify the name of the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn855">50</xref></sup> Come and see. When the celestial beings were created, those below were created with half of the name, as stated (in Is. 26:4): <small>FOR THROUGH YH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn856">51</xref></sup> <small>THE LORD FORMED THE WORLDS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn857">52</xref></sup> But why were they not created with all of it? So that none of them would repeat the full name of the Holy One. Woe to those creatures who vilify the name of the Holy One in vain. See what is written about offerings (in Lev. 1:2): <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>. It does not say &#x201C;To the Lord, an offering,&#x201D; but <small>AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn858">53</xref></sup> so the Children of Adam vilify the name of the Lord in vain. It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 5:1 [2]): <small>DO NOT BE RASH WITH YOUR MOUTH</small>&#x2026;. [<small>FOR GOD IS IN HEAVEN AND YOU ARE ON EARTH</small>.] For who would say that God is not in Heaven and that the children of Adam are not on earth? However, Solomon has said: Every time that the weakest of the weak is from above, he defeats the warrior from below. Go and learn from Abimelech (in Jud. 9:53): <small>BUT A CERTAIN WOMAN DROPPED AN UPPER MILLSTONE</small> [<small>ON ABIMELECH&#x2019;S HEAD AND CRACKED HIS SKULL</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn859">54</xref></sup> And how much the more so in the case of a warrior among warriors from above&#x0021; See what is written about him (in Dan. 4:32 [35]): <small>ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH ARE OF NO ACCOUNT</small>, [<small>AND HE DOES AS HE WISHES WITH THE HOST OF HEAVEN AND WITH THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH</small>]. It is also written (in Ps. 47:3 [2]): <small>FOR THE LORD MOST HIGH IS AWESOME, A GREAT KING OVER ALL THE EARTH</small>. But the children of Adam are below. (Eccl. 5:1 [2]:) <small>THEREFORE LET YOUR WORDS BE FEW</small>. So what is there for you to do? To put your hand upon your mouth and upon your ear in order to neither speak nor hear. Ergo (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn860">55</xref></sup></p>
<title>1.14 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 5:1:) <small>&#x003C;AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING,&#x003E; WHEN HE IS A WITNESS TO WHAT HE HAS EITHER SEEN OR COME TO KNOW, &#x003C;IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small> &#x003E;. This text is related (to Prov. 29:24): <small>THE ONE WHO SHARES WITH A THIEF HATES HIS OWN SOUL</small>; [<small>HE HEARS SWEARING AND DOES NOT SPEAK OUT</small>]. What has caused anyone to say of him: <small>IF A SOUL SINS</small>? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; simply because he did not come and tell a sage: So-and-so blasphemed the name of the Holy One. He therefore shares his iniquities with him, as stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF HE DOES NOT SPEAK OUT, HE SHALL BEAR HIS INIQUITY</small>. Therefore Solomon has said (in Prov. 29:24): <small>THE ONE WHO SHARES WITH A THIEF HATES HIS OWN SOUL</small>. Just as when the thief is caught, his partner is convicted along with him,<sup><xref rid="fn861">56</xref></sup> so whoever hears blasphemy of the Holy One and does not speak out is convicted along with him. And let no one say: What denunciation do I say? The Holy One has said (in Lev. 5:1ff.): On every matter, there is a denunciation in it. &#x003C;Would there be, therefore&#x003E; an exception for cursing the Name? Why? Because &#x003C;it is&#x003E; just like a case of a person cursing his companion. When one hears him, it is of no concern to him. But if he has cursed his father in his presence, he puts his life on the line and says: You have cursed my father. Moses said (in Deut. 32:6): <small>IS HE NOT YOUR FATHER WHO CREATED YOU</small>?</p>
<title>1.15 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 5:1:) <small>AND IF A SOUL SINS IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>, [<small>WHEN HE IS A WITNESS TO WHAT HE HAS EITHER SEEN OR COME TO KNOW</small>.] The Holy One said: If you want to bear witness, bear witness; but if not, I will bear witness. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>WHEN HE IS A WITNESS</small>. And where is it shown that the Holy One is called a witness? Where it is stated (in Jer. 29:23): <small>I AM THE ONE WHO KNOWS AND BEARS WITNESS, SAYS THE LORD</small>. Come and see. All the parashioth written in this book have <small>MISTAKE</small> written in them, except for this parashah, in which <small>MISTAKE</small> is not mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn862">57</xref></sup> About him Solomon has said (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>]. It is comparable to two people who threw stones at an image of a king.<sup><xref rid="fn863">58</xref></sup> One was drunk, and one was in possession of his senses. Both of them were caught and went to trial. &#x003C;The judge&#x003E; rendered a &#x003C;guilty&#x003E; verdict<sup><xref rid="fn864">59</xref></sup> against the one with his senses and acquitted the one who was drunk. So it is in the case of whoever sins. It is concerning him that <small>MISTAKE</small> is written (in Lev. 4:2): <small>WHEN A SOUL SINS BY MISTAKE</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>GG</small>) &#x003C; <small>AGAINST ANY OF THE LORD&#x2019;S COMMANDMENTS</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. (Lev. 4:13:) <small>AND IF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL SHOULD ERR</small> (rt.: <small><italic>Sh</italic>GG</small>), because they all sinned by mistake, they bring an offering, and shall be forgiven them. It is so stated (in Numb. 15:26): <small>THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND THE STRANGER WHO RESIDES IN THEIR MIDST SHALL BE FORGIVEN BECAUSE &#x003C;IT HAPPENED &#x003E; TO ALL THE PEOPLE BY MISTAKE</small>. But the one who blasphemes receives a &#x003C; guilty&#x003E; verdict, as stated (in Lev. 24:16) <small>AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. [It is also written] (in Jer. 4:2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES, IN TRUTH, IN JUSTICE, AND IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. [<small>THEN SHALL NATIONS BLESS THEMSELVES IN HIM, AND HIM SHALL THEY GLORY</small>.] The Scripture also says (in Deut. 10:20): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR, HIM YOU SHALL SERVE, TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>, then after that, <small>AND BY HIM YOU SHALL SWEAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn865">60</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR</small>, so that you will be like those three of whom it is written: <small>HE FEARED GOD</small> (<italic><small>YR</small></italic>&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic><small>LHYM</small></italic>). About Abraham it is written (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small> (<italic><small>YR</small></italic>&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic><small>LHYM</small></italic>)&#x2026;. About Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18): <small>FOR I FEAR</small> (<small><italic>YR</italic></small>&#x2019;) <small>GOD</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>LHYM</small></italic>). About Job it is written (in Job 1:2): <small>HE FEARED GOD</small> (<italic><small>YR</small></italic>&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic><small>LHYM</small></italic>) <small>AND SHUNNED EVIL</small>. (Deut. 10:20, cont.:) <small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE</small>, in that you will be busy with the Torah and with &#x003C;fulfilling&#x003E; the commandments. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>, in that you will honor the disciples of the wise and share your property with them. Moses said to Israel: Do not think that I may have allowed you to swear by my name, even in truth. It is only, if all these conditions (mentioned earlier in the verse) abide with you, that you are entitled to swear by my name; and if not, you are not entitled to swear by my name, even in truth. You shall not be like those of whom it is written (in Jer. 7:9): <small>WILL YOU &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; SWEAR FALSELY AND SACRIFICE TO BAAL</small>? Fulfill all these conditions and after that you are mine, as stated (in Jer. 4:1): <small>IF YOU RETURN, O ISRAEL, SAYS THE LORD, IF YOU RETURN UNTO ME</small>&#x2026;. Then after that &#x003C;it says&#x003E; (in vs. 2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.16 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Our masters have said: Even in truth one cannot swear.<sup><xref rid="fn866">61</xref></sup> Why? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Dem</italic>. 2:3): <small>LET NOT SOMEONE FROM ISRAEL BE UNRESTRAINED IN VOWS</small><sup><xref rid="fn867">62</xref></sup> <small>OR IN JESTING</small>, so as not to lead one&#x2019;s companion astray with an oath by uttering &#x003C;one&#x003E; when there is no &#x003C; occasion for&#x003E; an oath.<sup><xref rid="fn868">63</xref></sup> There is a story about a royal mountain where there were two thousand towns, and all of them were destroyed because of a truthful oath.<sup><xref rid="fn869">64</xref></sup> Now if one who swears in truth has this happen, how much the more so in the case of one who swears to a lie? How did they act? One would utter an oath to his companion that he was going to such and such a place to eat and drink. Then they would go and act to fulfill their oath. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS &#x003C;IN THAT IT HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.17 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>Now when the Holy One comes to judge all people in the age to come, he will judge them along with sorcerers and adulterers.<sup><xref rid="fn870">65</xref></sup> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:5): <small>THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU IN JUDGMENT; AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS, AGAINST THOSE WHO SWEAR TO A LIE</small>.&#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; Moreover, I am finding them guilty and bringing them down to Gehinnom. The Holy One said: How is it that I have allowed you to be praising and glorifying my name, &#x003C;when&#x003E; you are reproaching, blaspheming, and swearing to a lie in my name? All people were created for my praise, as stated (in Prov. 16:4): <small>THE LORD HAS MADE EVERYTHING FOR HIS OWN PURPOSE</small>. So is it not enough for you that you do not praise him, but &#x003C;that&#x003E; you blaspheme &#x003C;him as well&#x003E;&#x0021; The Scripture has said (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA, &#x003C;FOR IT CANNOT REST</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShQT</small></italic>) &#x003E;&#x2026;. &#x003C;They are&#x003E; just like this &#x003C;kind of&#x003E; sea which has rollers in its midst exalting themselves upward. When each and every one of them reaches the sand, it is broken and returns (<italic>hozer</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn871">66</xref></sup> Moreover, its companion is looking at it. That one also, when it is to be broken, exalts itself upward without repenting (<italic>hozer</italic>). So are the wicked, who look at one another and exalt themselves. Therefore, they are likened to the sea, as stated (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>&#x2026;. All the generations, the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the Tower of Babel), did not learn from each other. Instead they were exalting themselves. Therefore, (in Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. The wicked have no rest in the world, but the righteous have serenity (<italic><small>ShQT</small></italic>), as stated (in Jer. 30:10): <small>AND JACOB SHALL AGAIN HAVE PEACE</small> (<small><italic>ShQT</italic></small>) <small>AND QUIET WITH NONE TO MAKE HIM AFRAID</small>.</p>
<title>1.18 Leviticus 5:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 57:20): <small>BUT THE WICKED ARE LIKE THE TROUBLED SEA</small>. Just as the sea has its mud in its mouth, so the wicked have their stench in their mouth. Thus it is stated (at the end of Is. 57:20): <small>AND ITS WATERS TOSS UP SLIME AND MUD</small>. It is not from choice that one hears blasphemies and invectives, but from the midst of the sins which are within him. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 5:1): <small>IF A SOUL SINS AND HEARS A VOICE SWEARING</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn872">67</xref></sup> You find &#x003C;that there are&#x003E; three things under human control and three things not under human control.<sup><xref rid="fn873">68</xref></sup> The following are under one&#x2019;s control: The mouth, the hands and the feet. The mouth: If one wants to be engaged in the Torah, he is engaged; &#x003C;if one wants&#x003E; to blaspheme and revile, he does so, because his lips are under his control. The hands: If one wants to give alms, he gives them; &#x003C;if one wants&#x003E; to steal, he steals. Why? Because they are under his control. The feet: One wanting to go to the synagogue goes; &#x003C;one wanting&#x003E; to steal, commit adultery, &#x003C;or&#x003E; murder goes, because his feet are under his control. But the following are not under one&#x2019;s control: The eyes, the ears, and the nose. The eyes: If one was passing through the market place and saw someone committing a transgression in the market place, he was seeing what was not under his control. The ears: If one heard the sound of blasphemies and invectives and did not want to hear them, what should he do? He heard what was not under his control. The nose: If one passed through a place of idolatry, smelled idolatrous incense, and did not smell it willingly, what should he do? He smelled what was not under his control. But when the Holy One desires, even these things which are &#x003C; ordinarily &#x003E; under one&#x2019;s control are not &#x003C;any longer&#x003E; under one&#x2019;s control. The mouth: When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One did not allow him. He blessed them instead, as stated (in Deut. 23:6): <small>BUT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID NOT WANT TO HEED BALAAM; &#x003C;SO THE LORD YOUR GOD TURNED THE CURSE INTO A BLESSING FOR YOU</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. Also the hands: Thus you find in the case of Jeroboam, when the prophet came <small>AND</small> (according to I Kings 13:2) <small>CRIED OUT</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>AGAINST</small>] <small>THE ALTAR</small> [<small>ACCORDING TO</small>] <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD AND SAID</small>: <small>O ALTAR, ALTAR</small>, [<small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: BEHOLD, A SON SHALL BE BORN UNTO THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>&#x2026;. ] Then Jeroboam said: Moses wrote in the Torah (in Deut. 13:2 [1]): <small>IF THERE ARISES AMONG YOU A PROPHET&#x2026; AND GIVES YOU A SIGN OR A PORTENT</small>. Now as for you, what portent are you giving me? He said to him: Is it a portent that you want? (I Kings 13:3:) <small>THIS IS THE PORTENT WHICH THE LORD HAS DECREED: BEHOLD, THE ALTAR WILL BE TORN ASUNDER</small>. Then (in vs. 4): <small>JEROBOAM</small> &#x007B;<small>RAISED</small>&#x007D; [<small>STRETCHED OUT</small>] <small>HIS ARM FROM OVER THE ALTAR, SAYING: SEIZE HIM, BUT HIS HAND &#x003C; WHICH HE STRETCHED AGAINST HIM &#x003E; WITHERED, &#x003C;AND HE COULD NOT DRAW IT BACK TO HIMSELF</small>&#x003E;. &#x003C;This is written &#x003E; to teach you that it was not under his control. Also the feet: Where it shown concerning them? From the men of Aram (i.e., Syria). When they came against Elisha, the Holy One said to them: Is it in your own right that you have come? What did he do to them? He misdirected them, as stated (in II Kings 6:19): <small>THEN ELISHA SAID TO THEM: THIS IS NOT THE ROAD, AND THIS IS NOT THE CITY</small>. &#x003C;This is written &#x003E; to teach you that even the feet are not under one&#x2019;s control. And not only &#x003C;now&#x003E; but even in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn874">69</xref></sup> [So it is stated] (in Job 12:23): <small>HE EXALTS</small> (<italic><small>MSGY</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>NATIONS AND DESTROYS THEM</small>. The written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) is <italic><small>MShG</small></italic>&#x2019; (which means, &#x201C;misleads&#x201D;).<sup><xref rid="fn875">70</xref></sup> Then he <small>DESTROYS THEM</small> &#x003C;and&#x003E; brings them down to Abaddon,<sup><xref rid="fn876">71</xref></sup> while the righteous watch them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 66:24): <small>THEN THEY SHALL GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE REBELLED AGAINST ME: THEIR WORMS SHALL NOT DIE NOR SHALL THEIR FIRE BE QUENCHED</small>.</p>

<title>2.1 Leviticus 6:1ff. (8ff.), Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 6:1&#x2013;2 [8&#x2013;9]:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C; UNTO MOSES SAYING &#x003E;: COMMAND AARON</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD, IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>? The Holy One said: If I had &#x003C; merely &#x003E; desired an offering, would I not have told Michael to bring me an offering?<sup><xref rid="fn877">1</xref></sup> From whom do I desire sacrifice? From Israel. And so it says about the shewbread (in Lev. 24:8) [<small>HE SHALL ARRANGE IT BEFORE THE LORD REGULARLY</small>] <small>ON EVERY SABBATH DAY</small>. But it is written (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF RIVERS OF OIL</small>? Balaam the Wicked was an advocate<sup><xref rid="fn878">2</xref></sup> for the nations of the world. It is in reference to his place (as their advocate)<sup><xref rid="fn879">3</xref></sup> that &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; speaks (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT</small> [<small>THOUSANDS OF RAMS WITH TEN THOUSANDS OF RIVERS OF OIL</small>]? He wants what you offer to him, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; a log<sup><xref rid="fn880">4</xref></sup> of oil. We (gentiles) offer him ten thousand times ten thousands rivers of oil. What did Abraham offer to him? Was it not one ram? It is so stated (in Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN</small> [<small>ABRAHAM</small>] <small>LIFTED HIS EYES TO LOOK AND THERE WAS A RAM BEHIND HIM</small>&#x2026;. If he wants, we should offer him thousands of rams; but what did Abraham offer him? His son. I might offer him my son and daughter, as stated (in Micah 6:7, cont.): <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION, THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL? MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION</small>? This is my first-born son. <small>THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL</small>? This is my daughter. See how crafty Balaam the Wicked was&#x0021; He began to say (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &#x003C; AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR</small> &#x003E;. He did not say, &#x201C;&#x003C; seven &#x003E; altars,&#x201D; but, <small>THE &#x003C; SEVEN &#x003E; ALTARS</small>. These are &#x003C; all of the &#x003E; seven altars, &#x003C; which &#x003E; they had built since the first Adam was created up to now. Now I am offering seven &#x003C; sacrifices &#x003E; corresponding to the seven of them. And what did they offer? Twelve cakes, as stated (in Lev. 24:5): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE FINE WHITE FLOUR AND BAKE IT INTO TWELVE CAKES</small>. When the Holy One appeared to him, he said to him: O Wicked One, what are you doing? He said to him (In Numb. 23:4) <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS</small>. To whom is this wicked one comparable? To a butcher who sold &#x003C; meat &#x003E; in the market. When his store was full of meat, the market commissioner<sup><xref rid="fn881">5</xref></sup> saw &#x003C; him &#x003E; and looked at the meat. &#x003C; When &#x003E; that butcher saw that he was looking at the meat, he said to him: Sir, I have already sent provisions<sup><xref rid="fn882">6</xref></sup> to your house. So it was with Balaam. The Holy One said to him: O Wicked One, what are you doing here? He said to him (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS WITH A BULL AND A RAM ON EACHALTAR</small>. He said to him (in Micah 6:7): <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS</small>? He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRST-BORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION</small>? The Holy One said to him: O Evil One, if I had desired offering, I would have spoken to Michael and Gabriel, and they would have presented offerings to me. It is so stated (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD, IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>? Among the children of Abraham are Isaac and Jacob. &#x003C; These are the ones &#x003E; who are the rams of the world. The Holy One said to him: What do you desire? To deceive yourself before me? &#x003C; To persuade &#x003E; me to accept offerings from the gentiles? You are not able. He said to him: It is an oath, (in the words of Lev. 24:8, cont.) <small>AN EVERLASTING COVENANT ON THE PART OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, they say, so that I only accept offerings from Israel. It is so stated (in Lev. 6:1&#x2013;2 [8&#x2013;9]): <small>COMMAND AARON AND HIS CHILDREN, SAYING: &#x003C; THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. When the nations said: What is this, whereby Israel is presenting offerings and sacrificing? the Holy One said to them (ibid.): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>). (Cant. 3:6): <small>WHO IS THIS THAT COMES UP FROM THE DESERT &#x003C; LIKE COLUMNS OF SMOKE PERFUMED WITH MYRRH AND FRANKINCENSE</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;? (Exod. 19:3:) <small>THEN MOSES WENT</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) <small>UP UNTO GOD</small>.</p>
<title>2.2 Leviticus 6:1ff. (8ff.), Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:1&#x2013;2 [8&#x2013;9]:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE&#x2026;: COMMAND AARON&#x2026;: THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. The Holy One said: Fulfill what is written above on the matter. Then after that &#x003C; comes &#x003E; <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. Why? (Is. 61:8:) <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. Even <small>WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Lev. 5:23 [6])? <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, WHEN ONE HAS SINNED AND IS GUILTY, HE SHALL RESTORE THE STOLEN GOODS WHICH HE ROBBED</small>. Then after that (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. If you desire to present an offering, you shall not rob anyone. Why? <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>. So when do you present a burnt offering so that I accept it? When your hands are clean of robbery. David said (in Ps. 24:3&#x2013;4): <small>WHO MAY ASCEND THE HILL OF THE LORD? AND WHO MAY STAND IN HIS HOLY PLACE? ONE WITH CLEAN HANDS AND A PURE HEART</small>. From the beginning of &#x003C; this book on &#x003E; offerings you learn (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ONE</small> (<italic>adam</italic>) <small>OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>. Why is Adam mentioned? It is simply that the Holy One said: When you sacrifice to me, you shall be like the first Adam in that he did not rob from others, since he was alone in the world. So also you shall not rob people. Why? (Is. 61:8:) <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. Why is it named a <small>BURNT OFFERING</small> (&#x2018;<italic>olah</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>)? Because it is the highest (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) of all the offerings. It is that which ascends (&#x2018;<italic>olah</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>). You should know that when someone brings a sin offering, the priest takes it and likewise the meal offering. Moreover, the peace offerings belong to their owners and a guilt offering belongs to the priest. In the case of the burnt offering, however, no creature tastes it. Rather all of it belongs to the Holy One. Therefore, it is called <small>BURNT OFFERING</small> (&#x2018;<italic>olah</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>), because it ascends (&#x2018;<italic>olah</italic>) to the Holy One, who is &#x003C; the &#x003E; Most High (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>).</p>
<title>2.3 Leviticus 6:1ff. (8ff.), Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>COMMAND AARON</small>&#x2026;. What is the function of Aaron here?<sup><xref rid="fn883">7</xref></sup> Israel was bringing offerings while Aaron waited. So the Scripture says here: <small>COMMAND AARON</small>. Note also, it is written (in Numb. 28:2): <small>COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING &#x003C; &#x2026; YOU SHALL TAKE HEED TO OFFER ME IN ITS DUE SEASON</small> &#x003E;, but here it says (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>COMMAND AARON &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;: THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE ONE WHO ASCENDS</small> (<italic><small>H&#x2018;LH</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn884">8</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Whenever someone raises (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) himself up, his end is to go in the fire.<sup><xref rid="fn885">9</xref></sup> [It is so stated (in Lev. 6:2 [9], cont.):] <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>&#x2026;. The generation of the flood &#x003C; suffered &#x003E; because of what they said (in Job 21:15): <small>WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM? AND WHAT DO WE PROFIT WHEN WE PRAY TO HIM</small>? For that reason they were sentenced to the fire (of Gehinnom). And likewise the Sodomites, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE</small>. When Pharaoh said (in Exod. 5:2): <small>WHO IS THE LORD</small>, [<small>THAT I SHOULD HEED HIS VOICE</small>]? he exalted (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) himself and said (in Ezek. 29:3): <small>THE NILE IS MY OWN AND I MADE MYSELF</small>. &#x003C; He is &#x003E; therefore (in the words of Lev. 6:2 [9]) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>, for so it says (in Ps. 18:14 [13]): <small>THE LORD THUNDERED</small> &#x007B;<small>FROM HEAVEN</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN THE HEAVENS</small>], <small>AND THE MOST HIGH GAVE FORTH HIS VOICE, HAIL AND COALS OF FIRE</small>. And also when Sennacherib exalted (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) himself and said (in II Kings 19:23 &#x003D; Is. 37:24): <small>IT IS I WHO HAVE ASCENDED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) <small>THE MOUNTAIN HEIGHTS TO THE REMOTEST PARTS OF LEBANON</small>&#x2026;, what happened to him? (II Kings 19:35:) <small>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THOUSAND &#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>&#x2026;. (According to II Kings 19:23: cf. 18:17&#x2013;35) he had blasphemed through a messenger (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn886">10</xref></sup> therefore (in II Kings 19:35 &#x003D; Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21:) <small>THE ANGEL</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THOUSAND &#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>. What did he do to him? (Is. 10:16): <small>AND UNDER HIS GLORY THERE SHALL BURN A BURNING LIKE THE BURNING OF FIRE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>UNDER HIS GLORY</small>? That it burned him from within and left alone his clothes on the outside, since a person&#x2019;s glory is his garment.<sup><xref rid="fn887">11</xref></sup> Why did the Holy One leave their clothes behind? Because they were descendants of Shem, as stated (in Gen. 10:22): <small>THE SONS OF SHEM ARE ELAM, ASSHUR</small>,&#x2026;. The Holy One said: I am indebted to their father Shem, because he took the garment and covered his father&#x2019;s nakedness, as stated (in Gen. 9:23): <small>THEN SHEM AND JAPHETH TOOK A GARMENT</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C; AND THEY COVERED THEIR FATHER&#x2019;S NAKEDNESS</small> &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn888">12</xref></sup> Therefore, the Holy One left their clothes alone and burned &#x003C; only &#x003E; their body. (Lev. 6:2 [9]:) <small>THAT</small> (i.e. the person who exalts himself) <small>IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS</small> (<italic>ha&#x2019;oleh</italic>) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>&#x2026;. And so &#x003C; it was in the case of &#x003E; [Nebuchadnezzar, &#x003C; who &#x003E; he exalted (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) himself. He said (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD; I WILL BECOME LIKE THE MOST HIGH</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>). The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, was it not enough that you should say (in vs. 13): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) <small>&#x003C; TO THE HEAVENS</small> &#x003E;; <small>ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD I WILL SET MY THRONE</small>, but that you should say (in vs. 14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD</small>, on high (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>)? And so he (i.e., Nebuchadnezzar) said to Hananiah and his friends (in Dan. 3:15): &#x007B;<small>WHO IS</small>&#x007D; [<small>NOW WHO IS</small>] <small>THE GOD WHO SHALL DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HAND</small>? I have burned his house and exiled his people. He did not stand against me in his house; so will he overcome me in my house? What did he do? He threw them into the fiery furnace. What did the Holy One do? He gave a sign to the furnace and it became a highway.<sup><xref rid="fn889">13</xref></sup> Whoever was designated to be burned [was not burned and whoever was not designated to be burned] was burned. So the fire went forth and burned half of the peoples. Thus you find, when they assembled for the dedication of the image, at first there were eight peoples, as stated (in Dan. 3:3): <small>THEN THE SATRAPS, THE PREFECTS, AND THE GOVERNORS, THE COUNSELORS, THE TREASURERS, THE JUDGES, THE MAGISTRATES, AND ALL THE PROVINCIAL OFFICIALS ASSEMBLED</small>. That makes eight peoples; but when they came in to see Hananiah and his friends, there were only four peoples written there (in vs. 27): <small>THE SATRAPS, THE PREFECTS, THE GOVERNORS, AND THE ROYAL COMPANIONS ASSEMBLED</small>. &#x007B;That makes four peoples.&#x007D; [So where were four peoples?] It is simply that (in vs. 22) <small>THE FLAME OF THE FIRE SLEW THEM</small>. Now Nebuchadnezzar also was burned by the fire, and the fright (i.e., repulsiveness) of &#x003C; a body disfigured by &#x003E; burning was put upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn890">14</xref></sup> Why was all of him not burned? The Holy One said: Leave this evil man half of himself so that he may know against whom he blasphemed. The Holy One said to him: O Wicked One, did you not say: I do not want to live with the children of Adam, but (in Is. 14:14): <small>I WILL ASCEND</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small><italic>LH</italic></small>) <small>UPON THE HEIGHTS OF A CLOUD</small>? [By your life,] (according to Dan. 4:22 [25]) <small>YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANS</small>. Just as he brought the plagues upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt, so he brought &#x003C; punishment &#x003E; upon Nebuchadnezzar. It is so stated (in Dan. 3:32 [4:2]): <small>THE SIGNS AND WONDERS WHICH THE MOST HIGH GOD HAS WORKED FOR ME IT SEEMED GOOD TO ME TO MAKE KNOWN</small>. This fright of &#x003C; a body disfigured by &#x003E; burning fell upon him. Therefore it is stated (in Lev. 6:2 [9]): <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS</small> (<italic><small>H</small>&#x2018;<small>LH</small></italic>) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>2.4 Leviticus 6:1ff. (8ff.), Part IV</title>
<p>[(Lev. 6.2 [9]:) <small>&#x003C; THIS IS THE TORAH OF THE ONE WHO ASCENDS</small> (<italic>h&#x2018;lh</italic>); &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn891">15</xref></sup> <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>.] This is the evil kingdom (of Rome), which exalted (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) itself, as stated (in Obad., vs. 4): <small>THOUGH YOU MAKE &#x003C; YOUR ABODE &#x003E; AS HIGH AS THE EAGLE, AND THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS, &#x003C; I WILL BRING YOU DOWN FROM THERE, SAYS THE LORD</small> &#x003E;. Moreover, it will be judged by fire, as stated (in Dan. 7:11): <small>&#x003C; I LOOKED ON THEN BECAUSE OF THE SOUND OF THE ARROGANT WORDS WHICH THE HORN UTTERED. &#x003E; I LOOKED ON UNTIL THE BEAST WAS SLAIN AND ITS BODY DESTROYED, GIVEN OVER FOR BURNING IN THE FIRE</small>. The Holy One said (in Obad., vs. 18): <small>THE HOUSE OF JACOB SHALL BE FIRE, AND THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH A FLAME, &#x003C; AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU</small> (i.e., Rome) <small>SHALL BE STRAW; THEY SHALL BURN IT AND CONSUME IT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;, <small>FOR</small> &#x007B;<small>THE MOUTH OF</small>&#x007D; <small>THE LORD HAS SPOKEN IT</small>. And what did he say through Moses (in Lev. 6:2 [9])? <small>THAT IS THE ONE WHICH ASCENDS</small> (<italic>ha&#x2018;olah</italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) <small>UPON THE BURNING PLACE</small>.] Then after that &#x003C; Scripture says &#x003E; (in Obad., vs. 21): <small>THEN SAVIORS SHALL COME UP ON MOUNT ZION TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU, AND THE KINGDOM SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<p>Sisera also &#x003C; was punished by fire &#x003E; because he blasphemed. Thus it is written about him (in Jud. 4:3): <small>AND HE OPPRESSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH MIGHT</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; with blasphemies and invectives.<sup><xref rid="fn892">16</xref></sup> He was therefore punished by fire, as stated (in Jud. 5:20): <small>THE STARS FOUGHT FROM THE HEAVENS; FROM THEIR COURSES THEY FOUGHT WITH SISERA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn893">17</xref></sup> &#x003C; There is &#x003E; also &#x003C; retribution &#x003E; in the world to come, when the Holy One comes to exact retribution from Esau. What did Esau do to him? Wrapped in a prayer shawl like a lion,<sup><xref rid="fn894">18</xref></sup> he came and took his seat beside Jacob. It is so stated, (in Obad., vs. 4): <small>AND THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS. STARS</small> can only mean Israel, since it is stated (in Gen. 15:5): <small>LOOK TOWARD THE HEAVENS AND COUNT THE STARS</small>,&#x2026;: [<small>SO SHALL YOUR SEED BE</small>.] Jacob says to him: My brother (&#x2018;<italic><small>HY</small></italic>), you shall not be like me.

You decreed over me that I should serve idols. If I had done so, I would have been condemned to death at the hands of Heaven; and if I had not served them, you would have killed me. Ergo (in Hos. 13:14): <small>MY BROTHER, YOUR WORDS ARE DEATH</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>MY BROTHER</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>HY</small></italic>), <small>YOUR DESCENT</small> (<italic><small>QTB</small></italic>) <small>IS TO SHEOL</small>. &#x003C; <italic><small>QTB</small></italic> &#x003E; is a Hellenistic<sup><xref rid="fn899">23</xref></sup> word.<sup><xref rid="fn900">24</xref></sup> &#x007B;While Jacob remained, Esau descended to Sheol.&#x007D; [When Esau descended to Sheol, Jacob remained by himself.] It is therefore stated (in Zech. 13:8): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS IN IT</small> [<small>SHALL BE CUT OFF AND DIE, BUT ONE-THIRD SHALL REMAIN IN IT</small>.] Now the one-third can only be Israel, since it is stated (in Is. 19:24): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>ISRAEL SHALL BE A THIRD &#x003C; PARTNER WITH EGYPT AND ASSYRIA, A BLESSING IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH</small>. &#x003E; So Israel, because they made themselves despised and lowly, was avenged by fire, as stated (in Zech. 2:9 [5]): <small>AND I MYSELF, SAYS THE LORD, WILL BE A WALL OF FIRE AROUND IT</small> (i.e., around Jerusalem), <small>AND I WILL BE A GLORY WITHIN IT</small>. When Esau departed from the world, the Holy One [and Israel remained, as stated (in Cant. 6:9): <small>&#x003C; ONLY &#x003E; ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE</small>. It also says:] &#x007B;It says:&#x007D; (in Deut. 32:12): <small>THE LORD ALONE DID LEAD HIM, AND THERE WAS NO FOREIGN GOD WITH HIM</small>.</p>
<title>2.5 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 7:11) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 3:17): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM&#x2019;S &#x003E; WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>. Whatever is written in the Torah is written &#x007B;as an expression of&#x007D; [to establish] peace.<sup><xref rid="fn901">25</xref></sup> Although wars are written about in the Torah, they are written about for the sake of peace. You find that the Holy One cancelled the decree &#x003C; of utter destruction (<italic>herem</italic>) &#x003E; for the sake of peace. When? When the Holy One said to Moses (in Deut. 20:19): <small>WHEN YOU BESIEGE A CITY A LONG TIME</small>&#x2026;., <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>&#x2026;. &#x003E; Now concerning that whole matter, the Holy One had said that he would destroy them, as stated (above in vs. 17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>. However, Moses did not do so. Rather he said: Am I to go and smite them now? I do not know who has sinned and who has not sinned. Instead, let me come against them in peace, as stated (in Deut. 2:26): <small>THEN I SENT MESSENGERS FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH &#x003C; UNTO KING SIHON OF HESHBON &#x003E; WITH WORDS OF PEACE, SAYING</small>: &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; When he saw that he did not come in peace, he smote him, as stated (in Numb. 21:35): <small>SO THEY SMOTE HIM, HIS CHILDREN, AND ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>. The Holy One said to him: I myself told you (in Deut. 20:17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>&#x2026;. Now you have come to them in Peace. By your life, just as you have said, so will I do. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT</small>. Therefore, it is so stated (in Prov. 3:17): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM&#x2019;S &#x003E; WAYS ARE WAYS OF PLEASANTNESS, AND ALL HER PATHS ARE PEACE</small>.</p>
<title>2.6 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 85:9 [8]): <small>LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD, THE LORD, WILL SPEAK; FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE UNTO HIS PEOPLE AND UNTO HIS SAINTS</small>. The peoples of the world said<sup><xref rid="fn902">26</xref></sup> to Balaam: Why did the Holy One tell Israel to bring him sacrifices without telling us anything? Balaam said to them: The sacrifices are only peace (i.e., the peace offering). Whoever has accepted the Torah in which they are written must offer sacrifice. You rejected &#x003C; Torah &#x003E; from the start, and now you wish to offer sacrifices. Whoever accepted it is the one who offers &#x003C; sacrifices &#x003E;, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE; THE LORD WILL BLESS HIS PEOPLE WITH PEACE</small> (i.e., with peace offerings). It is therefore stated (in Ps. 85:9 [8]): <small>LET ME HEAR WHAT GOD, THE LORD, WILL SPEAK; FOR HE WILL SPEAK PEACE UNTO HIS PEOPLE AND UNTO HIS SAINTS</small>. What did he speak? (Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>&#x2026;. Why was it worded, <small>THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>? Because it makes peace among the altar, the priests, and Israel. Come and see. The whole burnt offering belonged wholly to the flames. Also, in the case of the sin offering, its best parts and its devoted portions<sup><xref rid="fn903">27</xref></sup> belonged to the altar, its skin and its flesh belonged to the priests, but there was no enjoyment from it for Israel. So also in the case of the guilt offering. However, in the case of the thank offering, its blood and its devoted parts belonged to the altar, the breast and the shoulder belonged to the priests, but the skin and flesh belonged to Israel. It resulted in making peace among the altar, the priests, and Israel. It is therefore called (in Lev. 7:11), <small>THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>, because it made peace for all.</p>
<title>2.7 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>.] When they offered the sacrifice of the peace offerings, the Holy One would lift up his face to them, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn904">28</xref></sup> Is it possible for the Holy One to lift up a face to mortals? Two verses contradict each other. One text says (in Ezek. 33:11): &#x007B;<small>FOR</small>&#x007D; <small>I DO NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF THE WICKED BUT THAT THE WICKED TURN FROM HIS WAY AND LIVE</small>. The other text says (in I Sam. 2:25): <small>FOR THE LORD TOOK PLEASURE IN SLAYING THEM</small>. How has he not taken pleasure in the death of the wicked? It is simply that before their verdict was sealed, he did not take pleasure; after a verdict was sealed, <small>THE LORD TOOK PLEASURE IN SLAYING THEM</small>. And so Daniel said (in Dan. 10:21): <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. Our masters have said: There was a story about Our Holy Rabbi (i.e., about R. Judah the Prince) that, when he was passing through Simonia (where he lived), all the people of the city came out to meet him.<sup><xref rid="fn905">29</xref></sup> They wanted one elder from him to teach Torah. He gave them R. Levi bar Simon. They said to him: Rabbenu, what is the meaning of what is written in Daniel (10:21): <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>? Is there something false in the Torah that it &#x003C; must specifically &#x003E; say <small>TRUTH</small> &#x003C; here &#x003E;? &#x003C; When &#x003E; he did not find an answer to give them, he immediately went away [from there and came] to Rabbi. He said to him: I could not stand up before them. They asked me one thing, and I could not find out what to answer them. He said to him: What was the &#x003C; one &#x003E; thing. He said to him: <small>HOWEVER, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. Is there something false in the Torah? He said to him: There was a great answer for you to give them. He said to him: You had something to tell them: When someone sins, the Holy One inscribes death for him. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, the record is canceled. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he does not repent, <small>IT IS INSCRIBED IN THE RECORD OF TRUTH</small>. [Here] also one text says (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>&#x2026;, while another text says (in Deut. 10:17): <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small>. If he lifts it up, why does he not lift it up? It is simply that for the nations of the world, &#x003C; he is one &#x003E; <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small>, but for Israel, <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>. The Holy One said: Just as Israel lifts up a face to me, so I lift up a face to them. And how do they lift up a face to me? &#x003C; When &#x003E; someone poor from Israel has four children, he takes one loaf. They sit down and eat all that loaf, but they are not satisfied from what there is in it. So they give a blessing and say (from Deut. 8:10): <small>THEN YOU SHALL EAT, BE FULL</small>, [<small>AND BLESS</small>]. I shall also lift up a face to them, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 7:11): <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>.</p>
<title>2.8 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 7:12:) <small>IF HE OFFERS IT FORA THANKSGIVING</small>&#x2026;. See how the Holy One forgives the sins of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn906">30</xref></sup> So what did they offer to the Holy One? It is simply that the Holy One said: Whoever has a bull, let him bring a bull; and whoever has a calf let him bring a calf. Whoever has a lamb, let him bring a lamb. Whoever has a dove, let him bring a dove. Whoever has only one of all these, let him bring fine flour; and whoever has neither flour nor anything at all, let him bring words. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 14:3 [2]): <small>TAKE YOUR WORDS WITH YOU</small> [<small>AND RETURN UNTO THE LORD</small>]. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 7:12:) <small>IF HE OFFERS IT FOR A THANKSGIVING</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>2.9 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>&#x2026;. You find (in Ezra 10:19): <small>AND THEY GAVE THEIR WORD</small> (literally, <small>THEIR HAND</small>) <small>THAT THEY WOULD PUT AWAY THEIR WIVES; AND BEING GUILTY, &#x003C; THEY GAVE &#x003E; A RAM FROM</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; [<small>A</small>] <small>FLOCK FOR THEIR GUILT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn907">31</xref></sup> Now the sin offering &#x007B;was&#x007D; [took place] for the unintentional sin, as stated (in Numb. 15:25): <small>AND THEIR SIN OFFERING BEFORE THE LORD FOR THEIR UNINTENTIONAL SIN</small>. A burnt offering took place for a thought of the heart. Thus it is stated (in Job 1:5): <small>AND RISING EARLY IN THE MORNING, HE WOULD OFFER BURNT OFFERINGS, ONE FOR EACH OF THEM, FOR JOB SAID: PERHAPS MY CHILDREN HAVE SINNED AND BLASPHEMED GOD IN THEIR HEARTS</small>. But when the thank offering took place, it took place on account of their gratitude. The Holy One said: This is the dearest to me of all the offerings. David said (in Ps. 50:23): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES A THANK OFFERING HONORS ME</small> (<italic><small>YKBDNNI</small></italic>). It does not say <italic><small>YKBDNI</small></italic> but <italic><small>YKBDNNI</small></italic>, &#x003C; spelled with N &#x003E; two times, &#x003C; once &#x003E; for this world and &#x003C; once &#x003E; for the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn908">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Judah bar Gadya said: Whoever answers <italic>Amen</italic> in this world merits answering <italic>Amen</italic> in the world to come. Where is it shown? &#x003C; Where it is stated &#x003E; (in Ps. 41:14 [13]): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL, FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING</small> (literally: <small>FROM THE WORLD AND UNTO THE WORLD</small>). <small>AMEN AND AMEN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AMEN AND AMEN? AMEN</small> in this world and <small>AMEN</small> in the world to come. Ergo (in Ps. 50:23): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES A THANK OFFERING HONORS ME</small>.</p>
<title>2.10 Leviticus 7:11ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. [Peace offerings rank high] because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven. Eleazar haQappar says: Peace is great, because even though Israel worships idols but &#x003C; still &#x003E; forms one fellowship (<italic>havurah</italic>), strict justice does not harm them.<sup><xref rid="fn909">33</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Hos. 4:17): <small>EPHRAIM IS ASSOCIATED</small> (<italic>havur</italic>) <small>WITH IDOLS. LET HIM BE</small>. R. Levi says: Peace is great, because there is no conclusion to the Priestly Blessing except peace, as stated (in Numb. 6:26): <small>AND GRANT YOU PEACE</small>. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said: Peace is great, because the Holy One has written things in the Torah which are there only because of Peace.<sup><xref rid="fn910">34</xref></sup> They are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>When Jacob had died, (Gen. 50:15:) <small>AND JOSEPH&#x2019;S BROTHERS SAW THAT THEIR FATHER WAS DEAD</small>&#x2026;, what did they do?<sup><xref rid="fn911">35</xref></sup> They went to Bilhah and said to her: Go in unto Joseph and say to him (in Gen. 50:16): <small>BEFORE HE DIED YOUR FATHER GAVE A COMMAND SAYING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn912">36</xref></sup> Now Jacob never commanded any of these things at all; yet they said this thing on their own. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: See how much ink was spilled, how many pens<sup><xref rid="fn913">37</xref></sup> were broken, &#x007B;how many children were whipped,&#x007D; how many skins were &#x007B;destroyed&#x007D; [prepared], [and how many children were whipped], in order to learn something which was not in the Torah. See how great is the power of peace&#x0021;</li>
<li>And so you find in the case of Sarah, when the ministering angels came to Abraham and said to him (in Gen. 18:14): <small>AT THE SET TIME I WILL RETURN UNTO YOU, AT THE TIME THAT LIFE IS DUE, AND SARAH SHALL HAVE A SON</small>, at that time (according to Gen. 18:12) <small>SARAH LAUGHED TO HERSELF, SAYING</small>:&#x2026; [<small>AND MY HUSBAND IS AN OLD MAN</small>]. The Holy One said to Abraham (in vs. 13): [But] <small>WHY DID SARAH LAUGH, SAYING: IS IT TRUE THAT I ALSO SHALL BEAR &#x003C; A CHILD &#x003E; WHEN I AM OLD</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn914">38</xref></sup> Now why all this? For the sake of peace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also in the world to come, when the Holy One returns the Diaspora to Jerusalem, he shall return them in peace. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 122:6): <small>PRAY FOR THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM</small>. And so it says (in Is. 66:12): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL EXTEND PEACE UNTO HER LIKE A RIVER</small>.</p>
<title>2.11 Leviticus 8:1ff., Part 1</title>
<p>(Lev. 8:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C; UNTO MOSES &#x003E;&#x2026;: TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM, THE VESTMENTS</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; This text is related (to Ps. 65:5 [4]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS</small>. Blessed is the one whom the Holy One has chosen, even though he has not brought him near.<sup><xref rid="fn915">39</xref></sup> And Blessed is the one whom he has brought near, even though he did not choose him. Now which was this one whom he chose? This was Abraham. &#x007B;However he did not bring him near; instead he brought himself near to him.&#x007D; It is so stated (in Neh. 9:7): <small>YOU ARE THE LORD, THE GOD WHO CHOSE ABRAM</small>&#x2026;. [However he did not bring him near. Instead he brought himself near.] In the case of Jacob, the Holy One chose him, as stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>JACOB, WHOM I HAVE CHOSEN</small>. It also says (in Ps. 135:4): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN JACOB FOR HIMSELF</small>. But he did not bring him near. Instead he brought himself near. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:27): <small>BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN DWELLING IN TENTS</small>. Moses he chose but did not bring near, as stated (in Ps. 106:23): &#x003C; &#x2026;, &#x003E; <small>HAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN ONE &#x003C; STOOD IN THE BREACH</small> &#x003E;,&#x2026;. David he chose but did not bring near, as stated (in Ps. 78:70): <small>HE CHOSE DAVID, HIS SERVANT</small>. He also brought himself near, as stated (in Ps. 119:63): <small>I AM A COMPANION TO ALL WHO FEAR YOU</small>. Blessed are those whom the Holy One chose, even though he did not bring them near. Come and see Jethro. The Holy One brought him near, but he did not choose him. In the case of Rahab the harlot, he brought her near but did not choose her. Aaron was doubly blessed because &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; chose him and brought him near. Where is it shown that he chose him? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 2:28): <small>AND I CHOSE HIM</small> [<small>FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST</small>]. And where is it shown that he brought him near? Where it is stated (in Exod. 28:1): <small>AND YOU SHALL BRING NEAR UNTO YOURSELF YOUR BROTHER AARON &#x003C; AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM,&#x2026; TO SERVE ME AS PRIESTS</small> &#x003E;. Therefore, David praised him (in Ps. 65:5 [4]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR &#x003C; TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>2.12 Leviticus 8:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS</small>.] It is written (in Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>, [<small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>.] This verse functioned in the beginning of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn916">40</xref></sup> <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Noah and his children. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to the generation of the flood. There is also this interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Shem of whom it is stated (in Gen. 9:26): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM</small>. (Prov. 3:35, cont.): <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Ham of whom it is stated (in Gen. 9:25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small> (the son of Ham).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:35): <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Abraham. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to the kings whom he smote (in Gen. 14:15). <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Isaac. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are the people of Gerar. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Jacob. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Esau and his chiefs. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Joshua. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are the thirty-one kings whom he smote (according to Josh. 12:24). <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to David. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. This refers to Goliath. <small>THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. This refers to Eli. <small>BUT FOOLS TAKE UP SHAME</small>. These are his sons, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 2:12): <small>NOW ELI&#x2019;S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS. THE WISE SHALL INHERIT GLORY</small>. These are the sons of Aaron, of whom it is stated (in Lev. 8:2): <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS</small>&#x2026;. Why is <small>TAKE</small> mentioned here? The Holy One said to Moses: I am duty-bound to taking. You are to arise and magnify him through taking. And when did he take Aaron? When (in Numb. 17:11 [16:46]) <small>WRATH HAS GONE FORTH</small> upon those who hate Israel. Moses said to him (at the beginning of the verse): <small>TAKE THE FIRE PAN, AND PUT FIRE &#x003C; FROM THE ALTAR &#x003E; ON IT</small>. Aaron said to him: My Lord Moses, do you wish to kill me? Because my sons offered profane<sup><xref rid="fn917">41</xref></sup> fire to the Holy One, they were destroyed by fire, [as stated (in Lev. 10:1&#x2013;2): <small>&#x003C; NOW AARON&#x2019;S SONS, NADAB AND ABIHU EACH TOOK HIS FIRE PAN&#x2026;; &#x003E; AND THEY OFFERED ALIEN FIRE BEFORE THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM</small>.] Now you are saying: <small>TAKE THE FIRE PAN</small>&#x0021; My sons brought in strange fire and were destroyed by fire. So should I bring forth holy fire outside? Then I would die or be destroyed by fire. Moses said to him: Go and act quickly; for as you are talking, they are dying. Rather (according to Numb. 17:11 [16:46], cont.) <small>TAKE IT QUICKLY UNTO THE CONGREGATION AND MAKE ATONEMENT FOR THEM</small>. When Aaron heard that, he said: If I die for Israel, am I not adequate? Immediately (in Numb. 17:12 [16:47]) <small>AARON TOOK IT AS MOSES HAD SAID</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses (in Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON</small>. He magnified him through taking. Just as Aaron is going to save his children by taking, so you are to magnify him through taking. Ergo (in Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON</small>.</p>
<title>2.13 Leviticus 8:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 20:7): <small>THE ONE WHO WALKS IN HIS INTEGRITY IS RIGHTEOUS; BLESSED ARE HIS CHILDREN AFTER HIM</small>. This refers to Aaron and his children.<sup><xref rid="fn918">42</xref></sup> If this interpretation is so,<sup><xref rid="fn919">43</xref></sup> Moses also was righteous, but his children were not like him. And Eli also was righteous, but his children were not like him. And Samuel [was] righteous, but his children were not like him. (I Sam. 8:3:) <small>BUT HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS</small>. Why do you say &#x003C; of Aaron &#x003E; (in Prov. 20:7): <small>THE ONE WHO WALKS IN HIS INTEGRITY IS RIGHTEOUS; &#x003C; BLESSED ARE HIS CHILDREN AFTER HIM</small> &#x003E;? Because during his lifetime he saw his sons after him serving in the High Priesthood. Therefore (in Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM</small>.</p>
<title>2.14 Leviticus 8:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 8:2:) <small>TAKE AARON</small>. The Holy One said to him (i.e., to Moses): Entice him with words, because he is fleeing from the &#x003C; priestly &#x003E; office. <small>TAKE</small> can only be a word &#x003C; implying &#x003E; persuasion, for so did Nebuchadnezzar (sic)<sup><xref rid="fn920">44</xref></sup> say to Nebuzaradan (concerning Jeremiah in Jer. 39:12): <small>TAKE HIM AND LOOK AFTER HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn921">45</xref></sup> So also it (i.e., Scripture) speaks of our mother Sarah (in Gen. 12:15): <small>&#x003C; SO PHARAOH&#x2019;S COURTIERS SAW HER AND PRAISED HER TO PHARAOH, &#x003E; AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>. And also (here in Lev. 8:2), <small>TAKE AARON</small> is language &#x003C; implying &#x003E; persuasion because he was fleeing from the office.</p>

<p>(Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: Pay him honor in front of all Israel, in order that they may see him when he enters the High Priesthood.<sup><xref rid="fn922">46</xref></sup> In addition, you are to warn them not to rebel against the priesthood like Korah and his crowd (in Numb. 16:1&#x2013;35). For I know that Uzziah is going to arise and rebel against the Priesthood (in II Chron. 26:16&#x2013;21). Thus it is stated (in Numb. 17:5 [16:40]): <small>IT WAS TO BE A REMINDER TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THAT NO OUTSIDER &#x003C; WHO WAS NOT OF AARON&#x2019;S SEED &#x003E; SHOULD DRAW NEAR &#x003C; TO OFFER INCENSE BEFORE THE LORD</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. He (i.e., Uzziah) was not of Levi&#x2019;s seed just as Korah was &#x003C; not of Levi&#x2019;s seed &#x003E;. It (i.e., the altar covering of Numb. 17:4 [16:39]) gave him a reminder: What you did to Korah you would do to him. It said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>LET HIM NOT BE LIKE KORAH AND HIS CROWD</small>. He said to it: And how did you act toward him? It said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>AS THE LORD SPOKE TO HIM THROUGH MOSES</small>. He (the Holy One) said to him (Moses): Just as I did to your hand (in Exod. 4:6): <small>AND WHEN HE WITHDREW IT</small> &#x007B;<small>FROM HIS BOSOM</small>&#x007D;, <small>BEHOLD IT WAS LEPROUS, &#x003C; AS WHITE &#x003E; AS SNOW</small>; so will I do to him (in II Chron. 26:20&#x2013;21). Therefore (in Lev. 8:3): <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>.</p>
<title>2.16 Leviticus 8:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>&#x2026;. He said to him: Where?<sup><xref rid="fn923">47</xref></sup> He said unto him: Unto the door of the Tent of Meeting. Moses our Master said to him: Sovereign of the World, &#x003C; there are &#x003E; sixty myriads of adults and sixty myriads of young people. How will I have them stand at the opening of the Tent of Meeting? &#x003C; The area is &#x003E; only the size of a field requiring of two seahs of seed; yet you are saying (in Lev. 8:3:) <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>. The Holy One said to him: Are you surprised about this command? Are the heavens not like a cataract on the eye? For I made them &#x003C; to stretch &#x003E; from one end of the world to the other, [as stated] (in Is. 40:22): <small>WHO HAS STRETCHED OUT THE HEAVENS LIKE A CURTAIN</small> [<small>AND SPREAD THEM OUT LIKE A TENT TO DWELL IN</small>]. And also in the world to come I will do likewise for Zion. How will all those populations<sup><xref rid="fn924">48</xref></sup> from the first Adam until the dead rise &#x003C; have room to &#x003E; stand? Then they are going to say (in Is. 49:20): <small>THE PLACE IS TOO CROWDED FOR ME; MAKE ROOM FOR ME TO DWELL</small>. What shall I do for them? I shall enlarge it, as stated (in Is. 54:2): <small>ENLARGE THE SITE OF YOUR TABERNACLE</small>? From where do you learn so? From Mount Sinai. When the Holy One appeared upon it, what is written (in Ps. 68:18 [17])? <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE MYRIADS, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS; &#x003C; THE LORD IS AMONG THEM ON SINAI</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. R. Avdimi of Haifa said: I have learned in my Mishnah: When the Holy One appeared on Mount Sinai to give the Torah, twenty-two thousand chariots came down with him.<sup><xref rid="fn925">49</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah [the Priest] said that the Holy One foresaw that none would remain in their teaching (literally: their water) except the tribe of Levi. He therefore came down &#x003C; with a number &#x003E; corresponding to the camp of the Levites (according to Numb. 22:39). R. Jannay said: If so, how is it that <small>THE CHARIOTS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RKB</small></italic>) <small>OF GOD ARE MYRIADS</small>. It is simply that twenty-two thousand chariots came down with the Holy One, with each and every chariot like the chariot which Ezekiel ben Buzi saw (Ezek. 1:19&#x2013;21); yet it (i.e., Mt. Sinai) contained them. Indeed the event was a miracle. The Holy One said: Become wider (rt.: <small><italic>RHB</italic></small>) and longer to receive my children, &#x003C; who are &#x003E; faithful children. And so you find in the world to come, that the Holy One will widen (rt.: <small><italic>RHB</italic></small>) Jerusalem, as stated (in Ezek. 41:7): <small>AND IT BECAME</small> &#x007B;<small>LONGER</small>&#x007D; [<small>WIDER</small>] (rt.: <small><italic>RHB</italic></small>) <small>AS IT WOUND ABOUT HIGHER</small> (<italic><small>LM</small>&#x2018;<small>LH</small></italic>)&#x2026;, until it was rising to the heavens.<sup><xref rid="fn926">50</xref></sup> Now, <small>HIGHER</small> (<italic><small>M&#x2018;LH</small></italic>) can only mean &#x201C;heaven&#x201D; (<italic><small>ShMYM</small></italic>). Thus it is stated (in Ps. 108:5 [4]) <small>FOR</small> [<small>YOUR FAITHFULNESS IS</small>] <small>GREAT, ABOVE</small> (<small>M&#x2018;L</small>) &#x007B;<small>THE HEAVENS</small> (<italic><small>HShMYM</small></italic>)&#x007D; [<small>HEAVEN</small> (<italic><small>ShMYM</small></italic>)].<sup><xref rid="fn927">51</xref></sup> When it (i.e., Jerusalem) reaches the heavens, it says (in Is. 49:20): <small>THE PLACE IS TOO CROWDED FOR ME</small>&#x2026;. Nevertheless, the Holy One raises it up from the heavens to the firmament, from the second &#x003C; heaven &#x003E; to the third, from the third to the fourth, from the fourth to the fifth, from the fifth to the sixth, and from the sixth to the seventh. R. Eleazar ben Jacob said: &#x003C; The elevation of Jerusalem continues &#x003E; until it reaches the throne of glory. But how are they (the Israelites) to ascend? The Holy One will bring clouds and will have them fly. Thus it is stated (in Is. 60:8): <small>WHO ARE THESE THAT FLY LIKE A CLOUD</small>? Then each and every one of the righteous will have a canopy (<italic>huppah</italic>) for himself. Thus it is stated (in Is. 4:5): <small>FOR THE LORD WILL CREATE OVER THE</small> [<small>WHOLE</small>] <small>SITE OF MOUNT ZION AND OVER ITS ASSEMBLY</small> [<small>&#x003C; A CLOUD AND SMOKE BY DAY AND THE BRIGHTNESS OF A FLAMING FIRE BY NIGHT &#x003E;; FOR OVER &#x003C; ALL &#x003E; THE GLORY THERE SHALL BE A CANOPY</small> (<italic>huppah</italic>)]. When it reaches the throne of glory, the Holy One shall say to them: I and you shall walk through the world &#x003C; together &#x003E;, as stated (in Lev. 26:12): <small>AND I WILL WALK AMONG YOU</small>. The Holy One will dwell in the middle and the righteous shall &#x003C; proudly &#x003E; point him out. It is so stated (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US</small>&#x2026;. It also says (in Ps. 48:15 [14]): <small>FOR THIS IS GOD, OUR GOD, FOR EVER AND EVER; HE WILL LEAD EVERMORE</small>. Because the nations say (in Deut. 32:37): <small>AND HE WILL SAY: WHERE ARE THEIR GODS</small>? Israel shall therefore say (in Ps. 48:15 [14]): <small>FOR THIS IS GOD, OUR GOD, FOR EVER AND EVER; HE WILL LEAD EVERMORE</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 3 Leviticus, Parashah III: <italic>Shemini</italic></title>
<title>3.1 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 9:1:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Eccl. 8:5): <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>. Who is this?<sup><xref rid="fn928">1</xref></sup> Aaron, of whom it is said (in Lev. 8:33, 35): <small>AND YOU</small> (i.e., you and your sons) <small>SHALL NOT GO OUT FROM THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING FOR SEVEN DAYS &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; AND YOU SHALL REMAIN AT THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING DAY AND NIGHT FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. Moses said to them: Observe mourning for seven days. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOU SHALL OBSERVE THE CHARGE OF THE LORD</small>. Moses said to them: Observe <small>THE CHARGE OF THE LORD</small>, for so did the Holy One observe seven days of mourning before he brought the flood. Where is it shown that he mourned? Where it is stated (in Gen. 6:6): <small>THEN THE LORD REGRETTED THAT HE HAD MADE HUMANITY ON THE EARTH</small>, [<small>AND HE WAS GRIEVING IN HIS HEART</small>]. <small>HE WAS GRIEVING</small> can only mean &#x201C;he mourned,&#x201D; for so it says concerning David (in II Sam. 19:3): <small>AND THE VICTORY</small> [<small>ON THAT DAY</small>] <small>WAS TURNED INTO MOURNING FOR ALL THE PEOPLE BECAUSE</small> [<small>ON THAT DAY THEY HEARD IT BEING SAID</small>:] <small>THE KING WAS GRIEVING OVER HIS SON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn929">2</xref></sup> So also Ezra said to Israel, when they were weeping, each one for his brother and each one for his child (in Neh. 8:10): <small>GO, EAT CHOICE FOODS AND DRINK SWEET DRINKS</small>&#x2026;. <small>DO NOT BE GRIEVING, FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD IS YOUR STRENGTH</small>. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 6:6): <small>AND HE WAS GRIEVING IN HIS HEART</small>. At that time the Holy One observed the seven days of mourning, before he brought the flood. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:10): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER SEVEN DAYS</small> [<small>THAT THE WATERS OF THE FLOOD CAME UPON THE EARTH</small>]. And so Moses was saying to Aaron the Priest and to his sons: Just as the Holy One mourned over his world before he brought the flood, so &#x003C; you are to &#x003E; observe the &#x003C; required &#x003E; mourning before he touches (i.e., harms) you. So they observed &#x003C; the mourning &#x003E;, but they did not know for what reason they were observing it. Why? (Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL; AND A WISE HEART SHALL KNOW &#x003C; THERE IS &#x003E; A TIME OF JUDGMENT</small>.</p>
<title>3.2 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>.] This is Moses, to whom the Holy One had already said (in Exod. 29:43): <small>AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION</small><sup><xref rid="fn930">3</xref></sup> <small>THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. &#x003C; In other words, &#x003E; I (the Holy One) will be sanctified there <small>THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Now Moses ministered during the seven days of priestly ordination but was afraid, saying: Perhaps divine judgment will strike him (i.e., Aaron). Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Still he did not act but said to Aaron: Observe seven days of mourning, for so the Holy One has told me (in Lev. 8:35): <small>FOR SO I HAVE BEEN COMMANDED</small>. When they had observed the seven days of mourning and &#x003C; when &#x003E; the eighth day had come, Nadab and Abihu went in to make an offering (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>). Divine judgment struck them, and they were destroyed by fire. It is so stated (in Lev. 10:2): <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM, SO THAT THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Moses came and said to Aaron (in Lev. 10:3): <small>THIS IS WHAT THE LORD SPOKE: THROUGH THOSE WHO ARE NEAR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) <small>TO ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED</small>. Where did he speak? In the Sinai desert. (Exod. 29:43): <small>AND THERE I WILL MEET WITH THE CHILDREN OFISRAEL, AND THERE SHALL BE SANCTIFICATION THROUGH MY GLORY</small>. Ergo (in Eccl. 8:5:) <small>WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.3 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 9:1:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn931">4</xref></sup> What is the meaning of &#x003C; the words &#x003E;, <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>): <small>DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small> (<italic><small>THWLW</small></italic>, rt.: <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn932">5</xref></sup> &#x003C; The verse refers &#x003E; to whoever sings in a Mahanaim dance (<italic><small>MHWLH</small></italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn933">6</xref></sup> And so it says (in Jud. 21:21): <small>TO DANCE</small> (<italic><small>LHWL</small></italic>) <small>IN THE DANCES</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Because no happiness endures for a mortal,&#x007D; (Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>). Why? The one who is happy today shall not be happy tomorrow; and the one who is depressed today shall not be depressed tomorrow. And so it says (in Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>)&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn934">7</xref></sup> Are you willing to understand that even the happiness of the Holy One did not endure? When? When the Holy One created his world. He was very happy, as stated (in Ps. 104:31): <small>MAY THE LORD BE HAPPY IN HIS WORKS</small>. It also says (in Gen. 1:31): <small>THEN GOD SAW EVERYTHING WHICH HE HAD MADE; AND BEHOLD, IT WAS VERY GOOD</small>. &#x003C; These verses are &#x003E; to teach you that the Holy One found pleasure in and took pride in his works. Then he gave the first Adam an easy commandment, but he did not fulfill it. Immediately he rendered him a verdict<sup><xref rid="fn935">8</xref></sup> &#x003C; of death &#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE, AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. So he, as it were, did not remain in his happiness but said: I created everything only for the human, and now he dies. What pleasure is there for me? [Now surely if the Holy One] did not remain &#x003C; happy &#x003E;, how much the less shall the children of Adam &#x003C; remain happy &#x003E;&#x0021; [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]</p>
<p>How happy Abraham was&#x0021; He was blessed in the world, magnified, slew some kings, and handed over heaven and earth to the Holy One. Also when the Holy One gave him a son at age one hundred, he circumcised him and reared him. Then finally he was told (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY CHILD</small>&#x2026;., <small>&#x003C; AND GO UNTO THE LAND OF MORIAH, &#x003E; AND OFFER HIM THERE AS A BURNT OFFERING</small>. So he made a three-day journey, as stated (in Gen. 22:4): <small>ON THE THIRD DAY</small>&#x2026;. When he returned from Mount Moriah, he buried Sarah. He did not find a place to bury her until he bought one for four hundred silver shekels. Then after that, old age came upon him. Now surely if such was the case with Abraham the Righteous, how much the more is it the case with the rest of the children of Adam&#x0021;</p>
<p>&#x007B;Isaac did not remain in his happiness.&#x007D; [In the case of Isaac also, how happy he was&#x0021;] The Holy One saved him from the sword and from &#x007B;burning&#x007D; [the fire] &#x007B;and from the men of Gerar&#x007D;. He also delivered him from the men of Gerar and informed them [about who he was, so that they came to him]. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:26, 28): <small>THEN ABIMELECH CAME UNTO HIM FROM GERAR</small> [&#x2026;. <small>AND THEY SAID: WE HAVE CLEARLY SEEN THAT THE LORD IS WITH YOU</small>.] But he did not remain in his happiness. Rather (according to Gen. 27:1): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE</small>. So just as &#x003C; this loss of happiness &#x003E; happened in the case of Isaac, (according to Gen. 22:2) the burnt offering of the Holy One, how much the more does it happen in the case of the wicked&#x0021; [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]</p>
<p>Jacob was the first-born of the Holy One, as stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>. How happy he was&#x0021; He saw a ladder, and (according to Gen. 28:12) <small>THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING</small>, as they looked at him with the Holy One standing above it. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:13): <small>AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD UPON IT</small>&#x2026;. Then he went to Laban, fled from Esau, became Laban&#x2019;s servant for twenty years, and in the end became wealthy, sired children, and returned in peace. He also met Esau, was saved from him, and paid his vow. But in the end he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to Gen. 34:1): <small>NOW DINAH &#x003C; THE DAUGHTER WHOM LEAH HAD BORNE TO JACOB &#x003E; WENT OUT</small>&#x2026;, &#x003C; and was raped &#x003E;. There also came upon him the trouble over Joseph. Now surely if Jacob the Righteous, one to whom the Holy One had said: In whom I will be glorified, as stated (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>, did not remain in his happiness, how much the less will the wicked &#x003C; so remain &#x003E;&#x0021; [It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.]</p>
<p>How happy Joshua was&#x0021; He slew thirty-one kings, gave Israel the land to possess, and distributed it. In addition all Israel gave him a &#x003C; helping &#x003E; hand and said (in Josh. 1:18): <small>ANYONE WHO DISOBEYS YOUR COMMAND</small>&#x2026; <small>&#x003C; SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH</small> &#x003E;. &#x003C; Such an honor was &#x003E; something of which Moses our master was not worthy. Still he (i.e., Joshua) did not remain in his happiness but died childless. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.</p>
<p>How happy Eli was, when he was king, chief justice, and high priest&#x0021; It is so stated (in I Sam. 1:9): <small>NOW ELI</small> [<small>THE PRIEST</small>] <small>WAS SITTING ON THE THRONE BY THE DOORPOST OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD</small>. [<small>NOW ELI THE PRIEST WAS SITTING ON THE THRONE</small>, because he was king. &#x003C; He was &#x003E; <small>BY THE DOORPOST OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD</small>, because he was chief justice]. Still he did not remain in his happiness. Instead (according to I Sam. 4:18): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN HE</small> (i.e., a messenger) <small>MENTIONED THE ARK OF</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>OF GOD</small>], <small>HE</small> (i.e., Eli) <small>FELL BACKWARD FROM OFF THE THRONE</small>&#x2026;. Moreover, his two sons, Hophni and Phinehas died. So just as this &#x003C; shift in fortune &#x003E; &#x007B;happens with the righteous ones&#x007D; [happened with Eli the Righteous], how much the more &#x003C; does it happen with &#x003E; the wicked&#x0021; It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.</p>
<p>You find neither man nor woman who saw joys like Elisheba bat Amminadab, [the wife of Aaron, as stated (in Exod. 6:23): <small>AND AARON TOOK FOR A WIFE ELISHEBA BAT AMMINADAB</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn936">9</xref></sup> She saw her husband become high priest serving in the high priesthood and prophet. In addition, Moses, her husband&#x2019;s brother, was king and prophet. Moreover, her sons were deputies &#x003C; to the high priest &#x003E; in the priesthood, and her brother Nahshon was head of all of the tribes of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn937">10</xref></sup> Still she did not remain in her happiness. Rather, when two of her sons went in to offer sacrifice, (according to Lev. 10:2) <small>FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM, SO THAT THEY DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.</p>
<p>And so Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>. There is a story about one of the great Babylonian &#x003C; scholars &#x003E;, who married off his son,<sup><xref rid="fn938">11</xref></sup> and made a great banquet for the sages. He said to his son: Go up and bring us a jar of such and such a wine from the attic. He went up to the attic. &#x003C; There &#x003E; a snake &#x003C; from &#x003E; among the jars bit him, and he died. His father remained with those who were reclining &#x003C; at his table &#x003E;. So he delayed and did not come. &#x003C; Finally, &#x003E; his father said: Let me go up and see what my son is doing. His father went up &#x003C; and &#x003E; found him cast down dead among the jars. What did that saint do? He waited by himself until the guests had eaten and drunk sufficiently. When they had finished, he said: You came to say a bridegrooms&#x2019; blessing over my son. Say a mourners&#x2019; blessing over him. You came to bring my son to the wedding canopy. Bring him to &#x003C; his &#x003E; grave. R. Zakkay of Kabul said (in the words of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>.</p>
<title>3.4 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 9:1:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>) <small>LIKE THE PALM</small>&#x2026;. This is Aaron, of whom it is stated (in Numb. 17:23 [8]): [<small>AND THERE</small>] <small>THE STAFF OF AARON OF THE HOUSE OF LEVI HAD SPROUTED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>). In the case of all the &#x003C; other &#x003E; trees, one plants them and they grow up by themselves (as single trees); but in the case of the palm, one plants it and it sends up sprouts on all sides. So it was in the case of Aaron. He planted and sprouts came up. These were Aaron&#x2019;s sons (i.e., according to I Chron. 6:35&#x2013;36 [50&#x2013;51]): <small>HIS SON ELEAZAR, HIS SON PHINEHAS, HIS SON ABISHUA, &#x003C; HIS SON BUKKI</small>,&#x2026;. &#x003E; (Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>) <small>LIKE THE PALM</small>. Where did he plant &#x003C; them &#x003E;? (Ps. 92:14 [13]): <small>&#x003C; THEY ARE &#x003E; PLANTED IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small>. (Lev. 8:33): <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT FROM THE DOOR OF THE TENT OF MEETING &#x003C; FOR SEVEN DAYS</small> &#x003E;. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 9:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>.</p>
<title>3.5 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 9:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY MOSES CALLED &#x003C; AARON AND HIS SONS</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. Our masters have said: All those days when Moses was in the thorn bush, the Holy One said to him: Go on my mission; but he was saying (in Exod. 4:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. By your life I am paying you back. Some day soon, when that Tabernacle is being made, you will be thinking privately that you should serve in the high priesthood; but I am telling you: Call Aaron to serve. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 9:1): <small>MOSES CALLED AARON AND HIS SONS</small>. There is a calling which is for abundance [and there is a calling for famine. Where is it shown &#x003C; that there is a calling &#x003E; for abundance?] Where it is stated (in Ezek. 36:29): <small>I WILL CALL FOR THE GRAIN AND INCREASE IT</small>. And where is it shown &#x003C; that there is a calling &#x003E; for famine? [Where it is stated] (in II Kings 8:1): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CALLED FOR A FAMINE</small>&#x2026; <small>&#x003C; FOR SEVEN YEARS</small> &#x003E;. There is a calling for greatness, as stated (in Lev. 9:1): <small>MOSES CALLED &#x003C; AARON</small> &#x003E;. Moses said to him: the Holy One has told me to ordain you as high priest. Aaron said to him: You have labored on the Tabernacle; so shall I be made high priest? He said to him: By your life, even though you are being made high priest, it is as if I were being made &#x003C; high priest &#x003E;;<sup><xref rid="fn939">12</xref></sup> for just as you were glad for me in my greatness, so I am glad for you in your greatness. Now when was he glad for him? When the Holy One said to him (in Exod. 3:10): <small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>. The Holy One said to him: Go, keep this commandment. Moses said to him (in Exod. 4:10 &#x0026; 13): <small>PRAY</small> (<italic>bi</italic>) <small>LORD</small>, you are doing me wrong (<italic>biya</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn940">13</xref></sup> My brother is older than I; yet I am going ahead of him. The Holy One said to him: [By your life], you have spoken rightly; nevertheless (according to Exod. 4:14), <small>WHEN HE SEES YOU HE WILL BE GLAD IN HIS HEART</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: The Holy One said to him: That heart which is glad for his brother&#x2019;s greatness shall have those precious stones (of Exod. 28:17&#x2013;21) laid upon it. Therefore, all those seven days that Moses was busy in the Tabernacle, he was sprinkling the blood and performing the sacrificial burning of the choice pieces. The Holy One said to them: What do you think? That you are high priest? Call your brother so that he may serve as high priest. Ergo (in Lev. 9:1): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS ON THE EIGHTH DAY MOSES CALLED</small> [<small>AARON AND HIS SONS, AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>]. Why <small>THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>? In order to promote him in the presence of the elders. The Holy One said to him: Call the elders and ordain him in their presence, lest Israel say that he became high priest on his own. Therefore (in Lev. 9:1): <small>AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>3.6 Leviticus 9:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 9:2:) <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO AARON; TAKE A BULLOCK &#x003C; OF THE HERD FOR A SIN OFFERING</small> &#x003E;. Why was it not told him &#x003C; to take &#x003E; a bull instead of a bullock?<sup><xref rid="fn941">14</xref></sup> He said to him: Because through the bullock (of Exod. 32) the priesthood was shaken in your hand, through a bullock it is being established in your hand. And not only that, but lest Israel say there are sins &#x003C; clinging &#x003E; to them from the deed of the bullock, for that reason he said they should offer a bullock &#x003C; for a sin offering &#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 9:3): <small>AND YOU SHALL SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: TAKE A MALE GOAT FOR A SIN OFFERING AND A BULLOCK</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; These things were said &#x003E; so that they would know that they had been forgiven for the deed of the calf. The Holy One said to them: In this world they have been forgiven through offerings, but in the world to come I will wipe away their sins without an offering. It is so stated (in Is. 43:25): I, <small>EVEN I, WILL PARDON</small><sup><xref rid="fn942">15</xref></sup> <small>YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS FOR MY OWN SAKE AND WILL NOT REMEMBER YOUR SINS</small>.</p>
<title>3.7 Leviticus 10:8ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 10:8&#x2013;9:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE UNTO AARON</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>. Why did he give a commandment concerning wine?<sup><xref rid="fn943">16</xref></sup> Because anyone who drinks wine will have boils, sores, shame, and reproach come upon him. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Prov. 23:29&#x2013;35): <small>WHO HAS WOE? WHO HAS SORROW? WHO HAS CONTENTIONS? WHO HAS TALK? WHO HAS UNEXPLAINED SORES? WHO HAS REDNESS OF EYES? THOSE WHO TARRY OVER WINE. DO NOT STARE AT WINE WHEN IT IS RED, &#x003C; WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR TO THE CUP,&#x2026; &#x003E; IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE; &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; YOUR EYES WILL SEE STRANGE THINGS; &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; YOU WILL BE LIKE ONE WHO LIES DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA, &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; THEY STRUCK ME, BUT I FELT NO HURT</small>. (Vs. 29:) <small>WHO HAS WOE? WHO HAS SORROW</small>? [&#x003C; means: &#x003E; About whom do they say: Woe? <small>WHO HAS CONTENTIONS</small>?] &#x003C; means: &#x003E; About whom do they say &#x007B;that they are masters of&#x007D; [that he is a master of] quarrels. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS TALK</small>?] &#x003C; means: &#x003E; And about whom do they talk? &#x007B;To whom do they talk?&#x007D; (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS UNEXPLAINED SORES</small>? &#x003C; means: &#x003E; Whom [do they say] has boils on his face? [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHO HAS REDNESS OF EYES</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ayin</italic>)?] &#x003C; means: &#x003E; And about whom do they say that his eyes (&#x2018;<italic>ayin</italic>) are bleary and red from wine? About whom do they say all these evils? (Vs. 30:) <small>THOSE WHO TARRY OVER WINE</small>. (Vs. 31:) <small>DO NOT STARE AT WINE WHEN IT IS RED</small>. Its end is blood. It is fine on the outside and bad on the inside; so never say that it is beautiful on the inside just as [it appears] on the outside (according to ibid., cont.:), <small>WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ayin</italic>) <small>TO THE CUP</small> (<italic>kos</italic>). &#x003C; This is the oral text (the <italic>qere</italic>). &#x003E; The written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) &#x003C; says: &#x003E; <small>TO THE PURSE</small> (<italic>kis</italic>). The drunkard sets his eye on the cup, but the shopkeeper &#x003C; sets his eye &#x003E; on the purse.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 23:31): <small>WHEN IT GIVES ITS COLOR TO THE CUP</small>. When one sees his comrade drinking, he says: Pour one for me to drink. Then he drinks and defiles himself in dung and urine. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE/IT<sup><xref rid="fn944">17</xref></sup> GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>. He ends in selling all the objects in his house and all his useful implements. Thus he &#x007B;has the use of&#x007D; [is left with] no clothes and no useful implements for the house, so that &#x003C; he is left &#x003E; &#x007B;without a utensil&#x007D; [with nothing]. So from &#x003C; having &#x003E; everything, <small>HE GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn945">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 23:31): <small>HE/IT GOES DOWN SMOOTHLY</small>. In the end he declares transgressions permissible and makes them &#x007B;a common like something accessible &#x003C; to all &#x003E;&#x007D; [something accessible &#x003C; to all &#x003E; like a common]. He converses with a woman in the market place where he talks obscenely and says evil things in a drunken state without being ashamed, because he is confused and knows neither what he is saying nor what he is doing. (Prov. 23:32:) <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>. When the snake bites a person, he does not feel it for an time; but after he goes home, &#x003C; the poison in &#x003E; the wound permeates him. <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>, most certainly like a snake. Just as in the case of the snake, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; cursed the land on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 3:17): <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>; so in the case of wine, a third of the world was cursed on account of it, as stated (in Gen. 9:24&#x2013;25): <small>THEN NOAH AWOKE FROM HIS WINE</small>&#x2026;, [<small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn946">19</xref></sup> Ergo (in Prov. 23:32): <small>IN THE END IT WILL BITE LIKE A SNAKE</small>&#x2026;. (Vs. 33:) <small>YOUR EYES WILL SEE STRANGE THINGS</small>. See what wine causes one who drinks it&#x0021; It causes him to serve idols. So it says (in Is. 28:7): <small>THESE ALSO REEL WITH LIQUOR AND STAGGER WITH STRONG DRINK</small>. What is the meaning of &#x007B;<small>REEL</small>?&#x007D; [<small>THESE</small>? &#x003C; These of &#x003E; which they spoke] (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:6): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SAT DOWN TO EAT AND DRINK, AND ROSE UP TO</small> &#x007B;<small>PLAY</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO ENGAGE IN AMOROUS SPORT</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn947">20</xref></sup> &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because of wine that they said (in Exod. 32:4) <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. Therefore (in Prov. 23:33): <small>AND YOUR HEART WILL SPEAK DECEITFUL THINGS</small>. Thus it causes four things: idolatry, uncovering of nakedness, shedding of blood, and evil speech. See how strong wine is&#x0021; So it is written (in Hab. 2:5): <small>AND MOREOVER, WINE IS TREACHEROUS</small>. It is also written (in Prov. 21:24): <small>A SCORNER AND ARROGANT ONE, INSOLENT IS HIS NAME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn948">21</xref></sup> Now <small>INSOLENT</small> must mean idolatry. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 119:21): <small>YOU REBUKE THE CURSED INSOLENT ONES</small>. Moreover, <small>INSOLENT ONES</small> must &#x003C; also &#x003E; refer to the uncovering of nakedness. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 86:14): <small>O GOD, INSOLENT ONES HAVE RISEN UP OVER AGAINST ME</small>&#x2026;.; and it says (in Ps. 19:14 [13]): <small>ALSO KEEP YOUR SERVANT FROM INSOLENT ONES</small>. Moreover, when one drinks and transgresses, he sees the whole world as a ship. It is so stated (in Prov. 23:34): <small>YOU WILL BE LIKE ONE WHO LIES DOWN IN THE MIDST OF THE SEA</small>. When he lies down they smite him, but he does not feel it. Thus it is stated (in vs. 35): <small>THEY STRUCK ME, BUT I FELT NO HURT; THEY BEAT ME, BUT I DID NOT KNOW IT</small>. So when he is unknowing and unashamed, he uncovers himself. Then afterwards he returns and seeks it (i.e., wine). [Thus it is stated] (ibid.): <small>WHEN I WAKE UP, I SEEK IT YET AGAIN</small>.</p>
<p>&#x007B;Isaiah said:&#x007D; See how evil is the end of those who drink wine. [Isaiah said] (in Is. 5:11): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO PURSUE STRONG DRINK; WHO REMAIN BEHIND IN THE EVENING FOR WINE TO INFLAME THEM</small>. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as wine causes such &#x003C; evils &#x003E;, it is right for me to command the priests not to drink wine when they minister before me? Ergo (in Lev. 10:9:) <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>.</p>
<p>Solomon said (in Prov. 23:20): <small>DO NOT BE AMONG THOSE WHO IMBIBE WINE</small>. Do not cause yourself to drink &#x003C; wine (<italic><small>YYN</small></italic>), which implies &#x003E; seventy. Then you would face seventy and fall into the hands of death. <italic>Y</italic> (&#x003D; 10) plus <italic>Y</italic> (&#x003D; 10), for a subtotal of 20, plus <italic>N</italic> (&#x003D; 50) results in seventy.<sup><xref rid="fn949">22</xref></sup> So you would face seventy &#x003C; members of &#x003E; the Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn950">23</xref></sup> and cause your own death. See what is written (in Deut. 21:18&#x2013;19): <small>IF ONE HAS A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>&#x2026;, <small>HIS FATHER AND MOTHER SHALL TAKE HOLD OF HIM &#x003C; AND BRING HIM OUT UNTO THE ELDERS OF HIS TOWN</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. Then the sentence shall be passed over him; <small>AND</small> (in vs. 21) [<small>ALL THE PEOPLE OF HIS OWN TOWN</small>] <small>SHALL STONE HIM</small> [<small>TO DEATH</small>] <small>WITH STONES</small>. Why? Because he is (according to vs. 20) <small>A GLUTTON AND A DRUNKARD</small>. So Solomon has said (in Prov. 23:20): <small>DO NOT BE AMONG THOSE WHO IMBIBE WINE, WHO GORGE THEMSELVES ON MEAT</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn951">24</xref></sup> lest you bring stoning upon yourself, the most weighty of the executions.</p>
<p>R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: In the Hebrew language the name &#x003C; for wine &#x003E; is <italic><small>YYN</small></italic>, and in the Aramaic language its name is <italic><small>HMR</small></italic>. By gematria<sup><xref rid="fn952">25</xref></sup> <italic><small>HMR</small></italic> becomes two hundred and forty-eight, corresponding to the &#x003C; number of &#x003E; parts in a human being. The wine enters into each and every member, so that the body becomes weakened and knowledge becomes confounded. When wine enters, knowledge departs. And so Eleazar haQappar has taught: Wine (<italic><small>YYN</small></italic>), with a numerical value of seventy enters; and secrets (<italic><small>SWD</small></italic>), with a numerical value of seventy,<sup><xref rid="fn953">26</xref></sup> depart.<sup><xref rid="fn954">27</xref></sup> Therefore, the High Priest was commanded not to drink wine during the time of the service, lest it confound his knowledge; for he preserves the Torah (and preserves the service) and the knowledge. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 2:6): <small>THE TRUE TORAH WAS IN HIS MOUTH, AND NO INJUSTICE WAS FOUND ON HIS LIPS</small>. It also says (in vs. 7): <small>FOR THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE</small>. Therefore the Holy One commanded Aaron (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>&#x2026;. [Moreover &#x003C; this injunction includes &#x003E; not only yourself, but (ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR CHILDREN AS WELL</small>. And] do [not] think that I may have commanded you &#x003C; only &#x003E; for the past in the beginning at a time when the Temple was standing and you were ministering in it, since it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE TENT OF WITNESS</small>&#x2026;. [Rather,] you shall also keep yourselves from wine forever, as stated (ibid., cont.:): <small>IT SHALL BE A STATUTE FOREVER THROUGHOUT YOUR GENERATIONS</small>. Therefore, keep yourselves from wine, because wine is a sign<sup><xref rid="fn955">28</xref></sup> of a curse. In the case of Noah, what is written about him (in Gen. 9:21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK</small>. What is written (in vs. 25)? <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Therefore (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>.</p>
<title>3.8 Leviticus 10:8ff, Part II</title>
<p>And so you find that the ten tribes went into exile only because of wine.<sup><xref rid="fn956">29</xref></sup> See what &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; says (in Amos 6:1): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO ARE AT EASE IN ZION</small>, because they were dwelling at ease in pleasure palaces. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND WHO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAMARIA</small>, because they were dwelling confidently in [Sebaste].<sup><xref rid="fn957">30</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE NOTABLES OF THE LEADING NATION, THE ONES TO WHOM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL COMES</small>. In what sense? The peoples of the world would sit and talk. They would say: Who is the mightiest in Israel? and they would answer: Samson. Then again they would say: Who is the mightiest among the gentiles? and they would answer: Goliath, about whom it is written (in I Sam. 17:4: <small>HIS HEIGHT WAS SIX CUBITS AND A SPAN</small>. Now these were agreeing<sup><xref rid="fn958">31</xref></sup> [with each other] and saying: Samson was the greatest is Israel. Ergo (in Amos 6:1): <small>THE NOTABLES OF THE LEADING NATION</small>. Then again they would say: Who is the wealthiest among the peoples of the world? and they would answer: Hadrian. Then who is the wealthiest in Israel? and they would answer Solomon, as stated (in 1 Kings 10:27): <small>AND THE KING MADE SILVER</small> [<small>IN JERUSALEM AS PLENTIFUL AS STONES</small>]. Come and see: Each and every tribe had its own May festival.<sup><xref rid="fn959">32</xref></sup> When one wanted to go to his May festival, he would take his herd with him, so that he would eat fatlings from his flock. It is so stated (in Amos 6:4 &#x0026; 6): <small>AND THEY WOULD EAT LAMBS FROM THE FLOCK</small>&#x2026;. [<small>THOSE WHO DRINK &#x003C; STRAIGHT &#x003E; FROM THE WINE BOWLS</small>.] What is their end? (Amos 6:7:) <small>THEREFORE THEY SHALL NOW GO AT THE HEAD OF THE EXILES</small>. Why? Because they had a passion for wine. For this reason he warns Aaron (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>.</p>
<title>3.9 Leviticus 10:8ff, Part III</title>
<p>Blessed is the one who does not have a passion for wine, for you find such to be the case with the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, in that their ancestor had commanded and told them not to drink wine. But what was his reason for not drinking wine? It is simply that he had heard Jeremiah prophesying that the temple would be destroyed. He said to them: From now on you are to be in mourning. (Jer. 35:7:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT BUILD A HOUSE</small>, [<small>SOW SEED</small>,] <small>PLANT A VINEYARD, OR OWN SUCH THINGS; BUT YOU SHALL DWELL IN TENTS ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE</small>&#x007D; [<small>ALL YOUR DAYS</small>]. Now they had observed the commandments of their ancestor; but when Jeremiah was prophesying to Israel &#x003C; and &#x003E; telling them to repent, they were not doing so. The Holy One said to Jeremiah: You are telling them to repent, and they are not doing so. Now in the case of the children of Jonadab ben Rechab, when their ancestor gave them a simple commandment, they observed it; but when I tell Israel to repent, they do not observe &#x003C; my commandment &#x003E;. It is so stated (in Jer. 35:14): <small>THE</small> &#x007B;<small>WORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>WORDS</small>] <small>OF JONADAB BEN RECHAB HAVE BEEN UPHELD. HE COMMANDED HIS CHILDREN NOT TO DRINK WINE, AND TO THIS DAY THEY HAVE NOT DRUNK IT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE</small> &#x007B;<small>OBSERVED</small>&#x007D; [<small>OBEYED</small>] <small>THE COMMANDMENTS OF THEIR ANCESTOR. BUT I SPOKE</small> &#x007B;<small>TO YOU</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO YOU</small>] &#x007B;<small>FROM EARLY MORNING TO LATE EVENING</small>&#x007D; [<small>CONSTANTLY</small>], <small>AND YOU DID NOT HEARKEN UNTO ME</small>. What is written there? The Holy One said to Jeremiah: Say to them: By your life, whereas you have heeded this commandment, your lineage shall never disappear from before me, even as it is written (in vs. 19): <small>THEREFORE, THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [<small>OF HOSTS, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>]: <small>SOMEONE BELONGING TO JONADAB BEN RECHAB SHALL NOT</small> &#x007B;<small>EVER</small>&#x007D; <small>BE CUT OFF</small> [<small>FROM STANDING</small>] <small>BEFORE ME FOR EVER</small>. He therefore enlightens them concerning wine (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>. Isaiah said (in Is. 24:11): <small>THERE IS A CRY OVER WINE IN THE STREETS; ALL GLADNESS IS OBSCURED</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ALL GLADNESS IS OBSCURED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RB</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn960">33</xref></sup> &#x003C; That &#x003E; all gladness has become dark, just as you say (in Gen. 1:5):<sup><xref rid="fn961">34</xref></sup> <small>AND THERE WAS EVENING</small> (&#x2018;<small>RB</small>). (Is. 24:11, cont.:) <small>THE JOY OF THE EARTH HAS</small> &#x007B;<small>COME TO AN END</small>&#x007D; [<small>DEPARTED</small>], because Zion has come to an end. Thus it is written (in Ps. 48:3 [2]): <small>BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &#x003C; EVEN MOUNT ZION</small> &#x003E;. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world wine is a sign of a curse, but in the world to come I will make it into fresh grape juice. Thus it is stated (in Joel 4:18 [3:18]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THE MOUNTAINS SHALL FLOW WITH FRESH GRAPE JUICE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>3.10 Leviticus 11:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 11:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;It is written (in Hab. 3:6):&#x007D; [This text is related (to Hab. 3:6):] <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn962">35</xref></sup> It is simply that, when the Holy One wanted to give the Torah, he arose and measured (<italic><small>MDD</small></italic>) the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn963">36</xref></sup> Then he gave the Torah in public<sup><xref rid="fn964">37</xref></sup> in the desert.<sup><xref rid="fn965">38</xref></sup> Therefore (in Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>, because he wanted to return the world to the measurements of his waters, when the nations did not want to accept the Torah. If it had not been for Israel accepting it, the world would have returned to the measurements of his waters. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as you say (in Is. 40:12): <small>WHO HAS MEASURED THE WATERS IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND</small>? But when Israel accepted it, the earth was still, as stated (in Ps. 76:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH WAS AFRAID AND WAS STILL</small>. So it is from there (i.e., from Sinai) that the gentiles received their judgement.<sup><xref rid="fn966">39</xref></sup> (Hab. 3:6, cont.:) <small>HE LOOKED AND MADE NATIONS TREMBLE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>). How did he make &#x003C; them &#x003E; tremble (<italic>hittir</italic>, rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>)? R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Johanan: He proscribed (<italic>dam hittir</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn967">40</xref></sup> them &#x007B;seven peoples&#x007D;, as stated (in Is. 60:12): <small>AND THE NATIONS SHALL BE DESTROYED</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay says: &#x007B;He proscribed (<italic>hittir dam</italic>) them &#x007B;seven peoples&#x007D; and their possessions.&#x007D; [Otherwise, compare what is said (in Numb. 13:16): <small>TO SPY OUT</small> (<italic>latur</italic>) <small>THE LAND</small>.] R. Aha said: He had them jump into Gehinnom, for it is stated (in Lev. 11:21): <small>&#x003C; KNEE JOINTS ABOVE THEIR FEET &#x003E; TO LEAP</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>) <small>WITH UPON THE GROUND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn968">41</xref></sup> R. Huna of Sepphoris said: He untied (<italic>hittir</italic>) their girdles.<sup><xref rid="fn969">42</xref></sup> Compare what is said (in Job 12:18): <small>HE UNDOES THE BOND OF KINGS</small>, [<small>AND BINDS A GIRDLE ON THEIR LOINS</small>]. R. Tanhum ben Hanila&#x2019;i said: He permitted (<italic>hittir</italic>) what was forbidden, abhorrent creatures and creeping things. Why? The matter is comparable to a physician who went to visit two patients.<sup><xref rid="fn970">43</xref></sup> He saw that one of them was in danger. He said to the children of his house: Tell him to eat whatever he wants. He saw the other, who was recovering. He said to the children of his house: Such and such food he may eat; such and such food he may not eat. They said to the physician: What &#x003C; difference &#x003E; did you see between the two of them [that you said to the one who was in danger: Let him eat whatever he wants, but said to the one who was recovering: Such and such food he may eat; such and such food he may not eat]. The physician said to them: When I saw that the one was dying, I said: Give him &#x003C; any food &#x003E; because he is going to die; [but let the other one watch himself, because there is life in him]. So also the Holy One has permitted (<italic>hittir</italic>) abhorrent creatures, creeping things, and all the transgressions for gentiles, who serve stars, because they are &#x003C; destined &#x003E; for Gehinnom. But in the case of Israel, because they are &#x003C; destined &#x003E; for life in paradise, he has said to them &#x007B;(in Lev. 11:44): <small>AND BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY</small>.&#x007D; (in Lev. 11:43): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MAKE YOURSELVES LOATHSOME</small>. [(Lev. 11:44): <small>AND BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY</small>.] This you may eat and this you may not eat. Why? Because they are alive, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. Ergo (in Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH</small>; [<small>HE LOOKED AND PERMITTED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>) <small>GENTILES &#x003C; WHAT IS FORBIDDEN</small> &#x003E;]&#x2026;..<sup><xref rid="fn971">44</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.11 Leviticus 11:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 11:2:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>. Three things Moses found difficult, the making of the menorah, the moon, and creeping things.<sup><xref rid="fn972">45</xref></sup> In making of the menorah, how &#x003C; was it &#x003E;? When Moses ascended &#x003C; Sinai &#x003E;, the Holy One was showing him on the mountain how he would make the Tabernacle. When he showed him the making of the menorah, Moses found it difficult.<sup><xref rid="fn973">46</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: See, I am making it before you. What did the Holy One do? He showed him white fire, [red fire,] black fire, and green fire. Then from them he made the menorah, its bowls, its pomegranates, its blossoms, and the six branches. Then he said to him (in Numb. 8:4): <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH</small>. When the Holy One showed him with the finger, he nevertheless found it difficult. What did the Holy One do? He engraved it on the his hand. He said to him: Go down and make it just as I have engraved it on your hand. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> &#x007B;<small>LIKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN</small>. But where is it shown that he engraved it on his hand? Where it is stated (in Ezek. 8:3): <small>HE STRETCHED OUT THE PATTERN OF A HAND</small>. Now <small>PATTERN</small> can only be for the making of the menorah, concerning which it is stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> &#x007B;<small>LIKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN &#x003C; WHICH YOU ARE BEING SHOWN ON THE MOUNTAIN</small> &#x003E;. Even so, he found it difficult and said (in Exod. 25:31): <small>WITH DIFFICULTY</small> (<italic><small>MQShH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn974">47</xref></sup> [<small>WILL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>]. How difficult was it to make? The Holy One said to him: Cast the gold into the fire, and it will be made automatically. So it is stated: <small>WITH DIFFICULTY WILL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. [<small>BE MADE</small> (a reflexive form, in the niph&#x2018;al) is what is written], &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; was made of its own accord.</p>
<p>In reference to the moon (<italic>yareah</italic>), where is it shown &#x003C; that Moses had difficulty &#x003E;? Exod. [12:1&#x2013;2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, SAYING: THIS MONTH</small> (<italic>hodesh</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn975">48</xref></sup> Observe and sanctify &#x003C; it &#x003E; like this. He showed him with a finger: <small>THIS MONTH</small>.</p>
<p>In reference to creeping things, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Lev. 11:29): <small>NOW THESE SHALL BE UNCLEAN FOR YOU FROM AMONG THE SWARMING THINGS WHICH SWARM ON THE EARTH</small>]. The Holy One caught each and every species, showed them to Moses, and said to him: This you may eat, and this you may not eat. [Thus it is stated] (in Lev. 11:2, 4:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>. [&#x2026;.<small>HOWEVER, THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.] Moreover, do not be surprised over &#x003C; this &#x003E; thing, since it is a fact that the Holy One showed all creatures to the first Adam, and he gave them names. After he had given names to all of them, the Holy One said to him: And I, what is my name? He said to him: It is Y____, because it is written (in Is. 42:8): <small>I AM Y____; THAT IS MY NAME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn976">49</xref></sup> [This the name, which the first Adam gave me.] It is my name, which I have agreed upon &#x003C; for use &#x003E; between me and my creatures. So if in the case of the first Adam, the Holy One had the creatures pass before him; in the case of Moses, when the Holy One wanted to warn Israel about the unclean and about the clean, are you surprised that he showed him and said to him &#x007B;(in Lev. 11:2&#x2013;4): <small>THESE</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>YOU MAY EAT</small>. &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>?&#x007D; [(in Lev. 11:2): <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>?] &#x007B;One must not say.&#x007D;</p>
<title>3.12 Leviticus 11:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 11:2:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>.] The Holy One said [to him]: Warn Israel not to eat bad things, lest your &#x003C; evil &#x003E; drive lead you astray, saying that the Holy One has forbidden Israel from having good things. The Holy One said: Whatever I have forbidden you from having, I have permitted you to have &#x003C; something &#x003E; that corresponds to it<sup><xref rid="fn977">50</xref></sup> I have forbidden you menstrual blood; I have permitted you virginal blood. [I have forbidden you &#x003C; animal &#x003E; blood; I have permitted you the spleen and the liver, which are wholly blood.] I have forbidden you the flesh of swine; I have permitted you the tongue of a fish with the name <italic>shibbuta</italic>, which resembles swine.<sup><xref rid="fn978">51</xref></sup> I have forbidden you &#x003C; another &#x003E; man&#x2019;s wife; I have permitted you a beautiful woman, as stated [(in Deut. 21:11&#x2013;12): <small>AND WHEN YOU SEE AMONG THE CAPTIVES A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM YOU DESIRE TO TAKE FOR A WIFE, &#x003C; YOU SHALL BRING HER INTO YOUR HOUSE</small>&#x2026;. &#x003E;] I have forbidden you a brother&#x2019;s wife; I have permitted her for you after his death, [as stated (in Deut. 25:5):] <small>HER BROTHER-IN-LAW SHALL HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH HER</small> [<small>AND TAKE HER FOR A WIFE</small>]. I have forbidden you mingled seeds, but I have permitted you a sindon<sup><xref rid="fn979">52</xref></sup> with a woolen fringe.<sup><xref rid="fn980">53</xref></sup> I have forbidden you the fat of cattle, but I have permitted you &#x003C; the fat of &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn981">54</xref></sup> game animals. R. Bisna said in the name of R. Hiyya: What the Holy One forbade for cattle he permitted for game animals, and what he forbade for fowl he permitted for fish. How? He forbade the fat in the case of cattle; he permitted it in the case of game animals. He forbade the thigh muscle in the case of game animals; he permitted it in the case of fowl. He forbade blood in the case of fowl; he permitted it in the case of fish. And why all this? In order to give Israel a good reward for observing the commandments.</p>
<p>(II Sam. 22:31 &#x003D; Ps. 18:31 [30]:) <small>AS FOR GOD, HIS WAY IS PERFECT</small>&#x2026;; for all the ways of the Holy One are perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn982">55</xref></sup> What does the Holy One care whether one ritually slaughters cattle and eats &#x003C; the meat &#x003E; or whether one slaughters cattle by stabbing and eats it? Will some such thing benefit him (i.e., the Holy One) or harm him? Or what does he care whether one eats what is unclean or eats what is clean? It is simply that (according to Prov. 9:12) <small>IF YOU ARE WISE, YOU ARE WISE FOR YOURSELF</small>; [<small>AND IF YOU SCOFF, YOU WILL BEAR IT ALONE</small>]. Thus, the commandments were given only to purify (rt.: <italic><small>TsRP</small></italic>) [mortals] through them, as stated (in II Sam. 22:31 &#x003D; Ps. [18:31 [30], cont.): <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD IS PURE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TsRP</small></italic>). Why? So that he might be a shield over you, [as stated] (ibid., cont.): <small>HE IS A SHIELD FOR ALL WHO TAKE REFUGE IN HIM</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 11:2:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>.</p>
<title>3.13 Leviticus 11:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Job said (in Job 14:4): <small>WHO CAN PRODUCE SOMETHING CLEAN OUT OF SOMETHING UNCLEAN? NO ONE</small>. After the Holy One permitted the cow and forbade the camel, who could declare clean or declare unclean?<sup><xref rid="fn983">56</xref></sup> Who has done so? No one. Not a single person in the world. Come and see: Originally at the creation of the world, everything was permitted, as stated (in Gen. 9:3): <small>AS WITH THE GREEN GRASS, I HAVE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING</small>. Then after Israel stood by Mount Sinai, he increased Torah and commandments for them in order to give them a good reward. But if so, why did he not so command the first Adam? The Holy One said: When I ordained an easy commandment for him, he transgressed against it. How could he fulfill all these commandments? On the very day on which it was commanded, on that day he nullified and transgressed against them (sic).<sup><xref rid="fn984">57</xref></sup> He was unable to remain obedient to the command for a single day. How &#x003C; did his disobedience happen &#x003E;?<sup><xref rid="fn985">58</xref></sup> R. Judah ben Pedayah said: Twelve hours make up the day. In the first hour the first Adam arose in the thought of the Holy One &#x003C; with a view &#x003E; to creation.<sup><xref rid="fn986">59</xref></sup> In the second he consulted with the ministering angels. In the third he gathered his dust. In the fourth he kneaded him. In the fifth he shaped him. In the sixth he stood him up as a <italic>golem</italic>. In the seventh he blew breath into him, as stated (in Gen. 2:7): <small>AND HE BLEW INTO HIS NOSTRILS THE BREATH OF LIFE</small>. In the eighth he brought him into the Garden of Eden. In the ninth he commanded him: Eat of this, and do not eat of that. In the tenth he sinned. In the eleventh he was judged. In the twelfth he was expelled. Thus you must conclude that he did not remain obedient to the commandment for even a single hour. R. Judah ben Pedayah said: Would that someone remove the dust from your eyes, O First Adam, you who could not persevere in your temptation for even a single hour, while here your children are keeping all the commandments which were given to them and persevering in them&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn987">60</xref></sup> One of them rises to plant, till, weed, prune, take pains to irrigate, and see the fruits of his plantings when they produce first fruits. Then he folds his hands and does not taste them, in order to fulfill what is stated (in Lev. 19:23): <small>THREE YEARS &#x003C; IT SHALL BE</small>] <small>FORBIDDEN</small> [<small>TO YOU</small>]&#x2026;. But in the case of the first Adam, it was told him: Eat of this, and do not eat of that. [It is so stated (in Gen. 2:16&#x2013;17): <small>YOU MAY FREELY EAT OF ANY TREE IN THE GARDEN; BUT AS FOR THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE &#x003C; OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU MAY NOT EAT OF IT</small> &#x003E;&#x2026;. ] He did not remain obedient to the commandment for a single hour. [Instead (according to Gen. 3:6), <small>THEN SHE ALSO GAVE SOME TO HER HUSBAND, AND HE ATE</small>.] But [when] your children were commanded to eat this and not to eat that, [they remained obedient to those &#x003C; commandments &#x003E;]. And &#x003C; this obedience is &#x003E; especially &#x003C; evident &#x003E; when someone from Israel takes a bovine, an ox, or a lamb, slaughters it ritually, skins it, washes it, and inspects its health. When it is found to be unfit, he holds back and does not eat it. Ergo (in II Sam. 22:31 &#x003D; Ps. 18:31 [30], cont.): <small>THE WORD OF THE LORD IS PURE</small>. [For that reason, the first Adam was not given commandments, because it was revealed to the Holy One that he could not remain obedient to them; but in the case of Israel, when the Holy One gave them many commandments, they accepted them and said (in Exod. 24:7): <small>ALL THAT THE LORD HAS SPOKEN WE WILL CARRY OUT AND OBEY</small>. He therefore warned them (in Lev. 11:2&#x2013;4:) <small>THESE ARE THE CREATURES THAT YOU MAY EAT</small>&#x2026;. <small>THESE, HOWEVER, YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.]</p>

<title>Chapter 4 Leviticus, Parashah IV: <italic>Tazria&#x2018;</italic></title>
<title>4.1 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 12:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING: WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>. This text is related (to Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>&#x0021; In regard to this verse, Job spoke it when the afflictions had come upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn993">1</xref></sup> He said: <small>O THAT I WERE</small> [<small>AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD</small>], and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother&#x2019;s belly&#x0021; <small>AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>&#x0021; &#x003C; These words &#x003E; teach that the infant is watched over while it is in its mother&#x2019;s belly.</p>
<p>[(Job 29:3:) <small>WHEN HIS LIGHT SHONE OVER MY HEAD</small>. From here you learn that the infant has light in its mother&#x2019;s belly.]</p>
<p>(Job 29:4:) <small>WHEN I WAS IN THE DAYS OF MY YOUTH</small> (<italic>horef</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn994">2</xref></sup> [<small>WHEN THE GOD&#x2019;S COMPANY WAS OVER MY TENT</small>. These words teach about the infant.] Just as the rain is at work in the soil for it to become muddy, so the infant is muddy in its mother&#x2019;s womb. &#x007B;<small>WHEN THE GOD&#x2019;S COMPANY WAS OVER MY TENT</small>. These words teach about the infant.&#x007D; Moreover, just as the infant stays muddy, [so is a person muddied] by sins, so that misfortunes come upon him. At that time &#x003C; Job &#x003E; said (in Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME</small>, and would that I had the days which I had when I was in my mother&#x2019;s belly&#x0021; What does he finally say (in vs. 4)? <small>WHEN I WAS IN THE DAYS OF MY YOUTH</small>. R. Abbahu said: The infant comes out of the mother&#x2019;s belly covered with slime and covered with blood; yet everyone praises and cherishes it, especially when it is a male.<sup><xref rid="fn995">3</xref></sup> Ergo (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>.</p>
<title>4.2 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE, &#x003C; AND YOU HAVE LAID YOUR HAND UPON ME &#x003E;</small>. The text speaks of the first Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn996">4</xref></sup> [R. Johanan] said: It is written about him that there were two creations. There is a double <italic>Y</italic> (i.e., a double <italic>yod</italic> in Gen. 2:7): <small>THE LORD GOD FORMED</small> (<italic><small>YYTsR</small></italic>) <small>THE HUMAN</small>. One formation is in this world, and one is for the world to come. But in the case of cattle, wild beasts, and birds, for them &#x003C; only &#x003E; one formation is written (without a double <italic>Y</italic> in Gen. 2:19): <small>SO OUT OF THE EARTH THE LORD GOD FORMED</small> (<italic><small>YTsR</small></italic>) <small>ALL THE WILD BEASTS OF THE FIELD &#x003C; AND ALL THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS &#x003E;</small>. It therefore says (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish says: <small>BEHIND</small> (in the sense of what comes afterwards) &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the first day. What is the reason? &#x007B;Resh Laqish said&#x007D; [Thus has R. Simeon ben Laqish said] (in Gen. 1:2): <small>AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD WAS HOVERING OVER THE FACE OF THE WATERS</small>. This <small>SPIRIT</small> was the soul of the first Adam. It therefore says (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE. BEHIND</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the first day. R. Eleazar ben Pedat says: <small>BEHIND</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day. How so? Because the Holy One created six things on the sixth day. They were these: (1) The soul, (2) wild beasts, (3) cattle, (4) creeping things, (5) beasts of the earth, and (6) Adam and Eve. Now Adam&#x2019;s soul was created first, as stated (in Gen. 1:24): <small>LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH A LIVING SOUL. LIVING SOUL</small> can only be the soul of Adam, since it is stated (in Gen. 2:7): <small>AND THE HUMAN</small> (<italic>adam</italic>) <small>BECAME A LIVING SOUL</small>. Hence, <small>BEFORE</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to the &#x003C; first &#x003E; event of the sixth day, and <small>BEHIND</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to the sixth day, since &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; was occupied with him all of the sixth day. Ergo (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE. BEHIND</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day, and <small>BEFORE</small> &#x003C; refers &#x003E; to an event of the sixth day. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: What is the meaning of <small>BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>? Having two faces, male and female. Hence it says (in Ps. 139:5): <small>YOU HAVE FORMED ME BEHIND AND BEFORE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn997">5</xref></sup> Adam said: After the Holy One had created all the cattle and wild beasts, he created me. So it is with the infant. Before it comes forth from its mother&#x2019;s belly, the Holy One commands it: Eat of this, do not eat of that, (in Lev. 11:29:) <small>THIS SHALL BE UNCLEAN FOR YOU</small>. Then after it takes upon itself in its mother&#x2019;s belly all the commandments which are in the Torah, &#x003C; only &#x003E; after that it is born. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>.</p>
<title>4.3 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>.] This text is related (to I Sam. 2:2): <small>THERE IS NO HOLY ONE LIKE THE LORD, FOR THERE IS NONE BESIDE YOU</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR THERE IS NONE BESIDE YOU</small> (<small><italic>BLTK</italic></small>, traditionally voweled as <italic>biltekha</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn998">6</xref></sup> Simply this: A king of flesh and blood builds a palace,<sup><xref rid="fn999">7</xref></sup> and his building outlasts (rt.: <italic><small>BLH</small></italic>) him; but the Holy One is outlasting the world, as it were, <small>FOR THERE IS NONE OUTLASTING YOU</small> (reading <italic><small>BLTK</small></italic>, voweled as <italic>ballotekha</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1000">8</xref></sup> (I Sam. 2:2, cont.:) <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>. How so? Flesh and blood fashions (rt.: <italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) an image (rt.: <italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) upon the wall, but is he able to fashion (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) it upon the water? The Holy One fashions (rt.: <italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) the embryo in its mother&#x2019;s belly in the middle of water. Ergo (in I Sam. 2:2): <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:2): <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>. When flesh and blood fashions (rt.: <italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) an image (rt.: <italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>), he (the fashioner) speaks, but his image does not speak. [Still, he] praises his image. In the case of the Holy One, however, his image stands up and praises him. [Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:2:) <small>THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>.] When flesh and blood wants to fashion an image, how many ingredients must he bring before he fashions it? But the Holy One fashions an image out of a single drop (of seminal fluid). Come and see the peacock<sup><xref rid="fn1001">9</xref></sup> in which there are three hundred sixty[-five] kinds of colors; yet it is created from a single drop of white stuff. Now you should not &#x003C; only &#x003E; speak about a bird, but also about a human being, who is fashioned from a single drop of white stuff. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>. [Ergo (in I Sam. 2:2): <small>AND THERE IS NO ROCK</small> (<italic><small>TsWR</small></italic>) <small>LIKE OUR GOD</small>. Another interpretation: When a king of flesh and blood fashions a image, his image does not make &#x003C; another &#x003E; image; but when the Holy One fashions an image, his image does make &#x003C; another &#x003E; image, for it fashions the woman, and the woman bears an image like it. (Lev. 2:12:) <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>.]</p>
<title>4.4 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>.] If the woman comes first, she bears a male; if the man comes first, &#x007B;he sires&#x007D; [she bears] a female.<sup><xref rid="fn1002">10</xref></sup> R. Abbin [Berabbi] the Levite said: The text has given you a clue (in vs. 5): <small>IF SHE BEARS A FEMALE</small> (with no mention of her giving her seed). If the man comes first, a female is produced; &#x003C; if &#x003E; the woman comes first, a male is produced. Thus it is stated (in vs. 2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: Therefore, the male is dependent (for his procreation) upon the woman; and the female, upon the man. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:20&#x2013;23): <small>BEHOLD MILCAH, SHE ALSO HAS BORNE SONS TO YOUR BROTHER NAHOR: UZ HIS FIRST-BORN AND BUZ HIS BROTHER,&#x2026; AND BETHUEL BROUGHT FORTH REBEKAH</small>. It also says (in I Chron. 2:48&#x2013;49): [<small>MAACAH</small>], <small>THE CONCUBINE OF CALEB BORE</small><sup><xref rid="fn1003">11</xref></sup> &#x007B;<small>SACAR</small>&#x007D; [<small>SHEBER</small>] <small>AND TIRHANAH. SHE ALSO BORE</small> &#x007B;<small>SHATSAPH</small>&#x007D; [<small>SHAAPH</small>] <small>THE FATHER OF MADMANNAH, SHEVA THE FATHER OF MACHBENAH AND THE FATHER OF</small> &#x007B;<small>GIBEAH</small>&#x007D; [<small>GIBEA</small>]. <small>AND THE DAUGHTER</small> [<small>OF CALEB</small>] <small>WAS ACHSAH</small>. Thus females are dependent (for procreation) upon the man; and the males, upon the woman. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>. R. Ayyevu said: The Holy One performs a miraculous act with a person. When a person is put in a furnace room<sup><xref rid="fn1004">12</xref></sup> for &#x003C; only &#x003E; a single day, is not his life struggling &#x003C; to survive &#x003E; because of it? But when an infant is put in its mother&#x2019;s belly for nine months,<sup><xref rid="fn1005">13</xref></sup> the Holy One protects it. Our masters have said: The Holy One has performed a miraculous act with this person. When the person is put in a bath tub<sup><xref rid="fn1006">14</xref></sup> for one day, does not his life fail because of it? But when the infant is put in its mother&#x2019;s womb for nine months, its life does not fail because of it. [Why? Because the Holy One is performing a miraculous act with it (i.e., with the infant).] Job said (in Job 36:3): <small>I WILL FETCH</small> (&#x2018;<small><italic>S</italic></small>&#x2019;) <small>MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR</small>. Now Job saw the children of Adam with a woman (&#x2018;<italic><small>ShH</small></italic>) giving birth to a man.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">15</xref></sup> Also the ship (of Prov. 31:14) sails in the midst of the waters inch by inch.<sup><xref rid="fn1008">16</xref></sup> Now he was surprised over these things and said (in Job 36:3): I (like the woman of Prov. 31:14) <small>WILL FETCH MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR</small>.</p>
<title>4.5 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED</small>.] R. Judah [bar Simon] said: A woman&#x2019;s two haunches become like two haunches of stone, in order that she may have strength when she gives birth.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">17</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 1:16:) <small>LOOK AT THE BIRTHSTOOL</small> (literally: <small>THE PAIR OF STONES</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn1010">18</xref></sup> R. [Meir] said: The Holy One performs a miraculous act with the infant.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">19</xref></sup> How? Before the woman bears, she retains blood; after she gives birth, the blood departs to the breasts and becomes milk. Then the infant nurses on them. R. Abba bar Kahana said: The Holy One performs a miraculous act with the infant. How? When the <italic>funda</italic> &#x007B;i.e., pouch&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1012">20</xref></sup> is full with its mouth down, the coins are scattered; but the woman has her <italic>funda</italic> &#x003C; with its opening &#x003E; down, and the fetus is retained. Another interpretation: An animal walks about with the fetus in the midst of its belly; but a woman walks about erect with the fetus in the midst of her belly, and the Holy One preserves it.</p>
<title>4.6 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 12:6): <small>AND WHEN THE DAYS OF HER PURIFICATION ARE FULFILLED, FOR EITHER A SON OR FOR A DAUGHTER, SHE SHALL BRING A LAMB IN ITS FIRST YEAR FOR A BURNT OFFERING</small>&#x2026;. Why does she bring an offering?<sup><xref rid="fn1013">21</xref></sup> Our masters have said: She screams a hundred times when she sits on the birthing chair, &#x003C; since there are &#x003E; ninety-nine &#x003C; chances &#x003E; for death and one for life.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">22</xref></sup> And when the pangs arrive for her, she vows that she will never favor her husband &#x003C; with sexual intercourse &#x003E; again. She therefore brings an offering,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">23</xref></sup> as stated (ibid.): <small>SHE SHALL BRING A LAMB IN ITS FIRST YEAR</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.7 Leviticus 12:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Lev. 12:3): <small>AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED</small>. It is not written here that one lays out expenses &#x003C; over circumcision &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">24</xref></sup> See how much Israel loves the commandments, how many expenses they lay out in order to observe them&#x0021; The Holy One said: You make the commandments joyful; I am increasing your joy, as stated (in Is. 29:19): <small>THEN THE HUMBLE SHALL INCREASE THEIR JOY IN THE LORD</small>. Tyrannus Rufus the Wicked asked R. Aqiva: Which works are the more beautiful? Those of the Holy One or those of flesh and blood? He said to him: Those of flesh and blood are the more beautiful. Tyrannus Rufus the Wicked said to him: Look at the heavens and the earth. Are you able to make anything like them? R. Aqiva said to him: Do not talk to me about something which is high above mortals, things over which they have no control, but about things which are usual among the children of Adam. He said to him: Why do you circumcise? He said to him: I also knew that you were going to say this to me. I therefore anticipated &#x003C; your question &#x003E; when I said to you: A work of flesh and blood is more beautiful than one of the Holy One? Bring me wheat spikes and white bread.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">25</xref></sup> [He said to him: The former is the work of the Holy One, and the latter is the work of flesh and blood. Is not the latter more beautiful. Bring me] bundles of flax and garments of Beth-shean. He said to him: The former are the work of the Holy One, and the latter are the work of flesh and blood. Are not the latter more beautiful? Tyrannus Rufus said to him: Inasmuch as he finds pleasure in circumcision, why does no one emerge from his mother&#x2019;s belly circumcised? R. Aqiva said to him: And why does his umbilical cord come out on him? Does not his mother cut his umbilical cord? So why does he not come out circumcised? Because the Holy One only gave Israel the commandments in order to purify them. Therefore, David said (in II Sam. 22:31 &#x003D; Ps. 18:31 [30]): &#x007B;<small>EVERY</small>&#x007D; <small>WORD OF</small> &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>IS PURE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.8 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 13:1&#x2013;3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small> &#x003C; <small>A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY, HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO AARON THE PRIEST</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND THE PRIEST SHALL INSPECT THE PLAGUE ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small> (<italic><small>ShTP</small></italic>)? R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: In Arabia they call the hair (<italic><small>S&#x2018;R</small></italic>) a flood (<italic><small>ShTP</small></italic>&#x2019;). Thus<sup><xref rid="fn1018">26</xref></sup> for each and every hair that a person has the &#x003C; Holy One &#x003E; has created its own separate follicle (literally: well).<sup><xref rid="fn1019">27</xref></sup> Because Job uttered a complaint and said: (in Job 9:17): <small>FOR HE CRUSHES ME WITH A TEMPEST</small> (rt.: <italic><small>S&#x2018;R</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1020">28</xref></sup> [<small>AND MULTIPLIES MY WOUNDS FOR NO REASON</small>], &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; for no reason he has brought all these afflictions upon me; Elihu said to him (in Job 34:10): Heaven forbid&#x0021; <small>MAY WICKEDNESS BE FAR FROM GOD AND INJUSTICE, FROM THE ALMIGHTY</small>. Rather (in vs. 11): <small>FOR HE REPAYS A PERSON ACCORDING TO HIS ACTIONS</small>, [<small>AND PROVIDES FOR ONE ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS</small>]. He brings everything &#x003C; upon a person &#x003E; according to measure. R. Abbin the Levite said in the name of R. Abba bar Kahana: The Holy One does not measure out reward and punishment &#x007B;with a respite&#x007D; [in a basket]. Rather everything is with justice, as stated (in Ps. 75:8 [7]): [<small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES</small>]; <small>ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. The Holy One said to Job: Even with regard to the hair which is upon you, I have made a follicle for it and made a measure for it, as stated (in Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small> (i.e., <small>FOR THE HAIR</small>). There is a story about a certain priest who examined leprosy spots. When he became poor, he wanted to go abroad. He called his wife &#x003C; and &#x003E; said to her: Because people used to come to me to show their leprosy spots, come and let me teach you, so that you may examine the leprosy spots. If you see a person&#x2019;s hair with its follicle dried up, you will know that &#x003C; such a person &#x003E; is stricken, because for each and every hair the Holy One has created its own separate follicle [from which it drinks]. &#x003C; If &#x003E; its follicle dries up, the hair dries up. His wife said to him: But surely if for each and every hair the Holy One has created its own separate follicle [from which it drinks], in your case, since you are a human being, with so many hairs on you and with your children being supported<sup><xref rid="fn1021">29</xref></sup> by you, is it not all the more certain that the Holy One will summon support for you?<sup><xref rid="fn1022">30</xref></sup> Therefore, she did not allow him to go abroad.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Job 38:25): <small>WHO SPLIT OPEN A CHANNEL FOR THE FLOW</small>? When the Holy One created the human, he created him in wisdom. How? If he had created him with a lot of water and a little blood, he would have become frail.<sup><xref rid="fn1023">31</xref></sup> If he had created him with a lot of blood and a little water, he would have become a leper. &#x003C; He therefore created him with &#x003E; half water and half blood. [Hence, this] is a perfect human.</p>
<title>4.9 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 13:1&#x2013;2:) <small>&#x003C; THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: &#x003E; WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY, HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO AARON THE PRIEST &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Why does it not say: <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, just as it says in all the &#x003C; other &#x003E; sections,<sup><xref rid="fn1024">32</xref></sup> [instead of: <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS</small>]?<sup><xref rid="fn1025">33</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 5:5): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS; EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. Because the verse says (in Is. 46:10) &#x007B;<small>THE ONE WHO SAYS</small>&#x007D; [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>MY PLAN SHALL COME TO PASS, AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>; whoever hears this verse, says: perhaps there is tyranny on high. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said: What is the meaning of <small>AND I WILL ACCOMPLISH ALL MY DESIRE</small>? That he does not desire to convict any creature, as stated (in Ezek. 33:11): [<small>THAT I DO NOT DESIRE THE DEATH OF THE WICKED</small>.] Ergo (in Ps. 5:5): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>? R. Johanan said: David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you desire to acquit, who will protest your authority? (Eccl. 8:4:) <small>FOR A KING&#x2019;S WORD IS SUPREME, AND WHO MAY SAY TO HIM: WHAT ARE YOU DOING</small>? It is customary, when a &#x003C; local &#x003E; ruler sits in judgement and wants to acquit or convict, for him to be afraid of one greater than himself, lest they put in an appeal<sup><xref rid="fn1026">34</xref></sup> to the imperial legate.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">35</xref></sup> An imperial legate is afraid of a governor;<sup><xref rid="fn1028">36</xref></sup> a governor is afraid of the king; the king is afraid of you; but you, if you desire to acquit or convict, of whom are you afraid? (Ps. 5:5): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE</small> (<italic><small>YGWR</small></italic>) <small>WITH YOU</small>. This expression (<italic><small>YGWR</small></italic>) can only be an expression of fear. Compare what is said (in Deut. 9:19): <small>FOR I WAS AFRAID</small> (<italic>from <small>YGWR</small></italic>) <small>OF ANGER AND RAGE</small>.</p>
<title>4.10 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 13:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL IS THAT ONE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">37</xref></sup> This verse is speaking about the first Adam, about Pharaoh, about Edom, [about Sennacherib, about Nebuchadnezzar,] and about the children of Adam &#x003C; in general &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1030">38</xref></sup> How does it concern the first Adam? When the Holy One created &#x007B;the world with&#x007D; the first Adam, R. Abba bar Kahana said: He created him in his likeness, as stated (in Gen. 1:27): <small>AND GOD CREATED THE HUMAN</small> (<italic>adam</italic>) <small>IN HIS OWN IMAGE</small>&#x2026;. He created him &#x003C; to extend &#x003E; from the one end of world to the other, as stated (in Deut. 4:32): <small>SO PLEASE ASK ABOUT THE FORMER DAYS WHICH CAME BEFORE YOU, EVER SINCE THE DAY THAT GOD CREATED ADAM UPON THE EARTH, EVEN FROM ONE END OF HEAVEN TO THE OTHER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">39</xref></sup> Now he ruled over the whole earth, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>&#x003C; FILL THE EARTH AND SUBDUE IT; &#x003E; AND RULE OVER THE FISH OF THE SEA</small> &#x2026; It also says (in Gen. 9:2): <small>MOREOVER, THE DREAD OF YOU AND THE FEAR OF YOU SHALL BE UPON EVERY BEAST OF THE EARTH</small>. It is therefore stated (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to the first Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">40</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">41</xref></sup> This refers to Eve, since she came out of him and caused him to die, [as stated] (in Gen. 3:6): <small>THEN SHE ALSO GAVE SOME TO HER HUSBAND, AND HE ATE</small>. [And where is it shown that she came out of him? Where it is so written (in Gen. 2:23): <small>BONE OUT OF MY BONE AND FLESH OUT OF MY FLESH, &#x003C; THIS ONE SHALL BE CALLED WOMAN, BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKEN OUT OF MAN &#x003E;</small>.] Ergo (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL IS THAT ONE</small>. [Another interpretation of] <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL IS THAT ONE</small>. This refers to Pharaoh, when he was world ruler,<sup><xref rid="fn1034">42</xref></sup> as stated (concerning him in Ps. 105:20): <small>THE RULER OF PEOPLES RELEASED HIM</small> (i.e., Joseph). (Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to Moses, since he was reared within that one&#x2019;s house, so that he believed that he &#x003C; actually &#x003E; was a child of his house, as stated (in Exod. 2:10): <small>WHEN THE BOY HAD GROWN UP, SHE BROUGHT HIM TO PHARAOH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER; AND HE BECAME HER SON</small>. Then he arose and brought ten plagues upon him, as stated (in Exod. 3:10): [<small>SO COME NOW, I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>.] (Exod. 4:17): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE IN YOUR HAND THIS ROD, &#x003C; WITH WHICH YOU SHALL PERFORM THE SIGNS</small>. R. Judah said: The rod had a weight of forty seahs and was &#x003C; made &#x003E; of sapphire<sup><xref rid="fn1035">43</xref></sup> It also had ten plagues (<italic>makkot</italic>) inscribed upon it with the acronym<sup><xref rid="fn1036">44</xref></sup> <italic><small>DTsK &#x2018;DSh B&#x2019;HB</small></italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">45</xref></sup> Then Moses, when he had looked at the rod and seen the punishment (<italic>makkah</italic>) which had been appointed to come, brought it upon Pharaoh. Ergo (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL &#x003C; IS THAT ONE &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL &#x003C; IS THAT ONE &#x003E;</small>. This refers to Edom, of which it is stated (in Dan. 7:7): <small>FRIGHTFUL, DREADFUL</small>, [<small>AND EXCEEDINGLY STRONG</small>]. (Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to Obadiah &#x007B;since he was an Edomite proselyte&#x007D;. [R. Isaac said: He was an Edomite proselyte]. He also prophesied against him (i.e., against Edom, in Obad. vs. 1): <small>THE VISION OF OBADIAH</small>. [<small>THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD TO EDOM</small>&#x2026;. ]<sup><xref rid="fn1038">46</xref></sup> &#x007B;R. Isaac said: Obadiah was an Edomite proselyte.&#x007D; Ergo (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to Edom. (Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to Obadiah.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to Sennacherib, since it is stated (in II Kings 19:24): <small>WITH THE SOLE OF MY FEET I HAVE DRIED UP ALL THE STREAMS OF EGYPT</small>. He also said (in II Kings 18:35 &#x003D; Is. 36:20 // II Chron. 32:14): <small>WHO ARE THERE AMONG ALL THE GODS OF THE LANDS WHICH HAVE SAVED THEIR LAND FROM MY HAND, &#x003C; THAT THE LORD SHOULD SAVE JERUSALEM FROM MY HAND &#x003E;</small>? [But it says this] (in Is. 8:8): <small>AND THE RADIAL BONES</small><sup><xref rid="fn1039">47</xref></sup> <small>OF HIS WINGS</small> (i.e., the army of Sennacherib) <small>SHALL &#x003C; FILL THE BREADTH OF YOUR LAND, O IMMANUEL &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">48</xref></sup> One sixtieth of the troops<sup><xref rid="fn1041">49</xref></sup> had been sufficient for the land of Israel, since it is stated (ibid.): <small>AND THE RADIAL BONE OF HIS WINGS</small>. This radial bone of a cock is one sixtieth of its wings. When he came to enter Jerusalem, he said to his troops: You sleep, and in the morning we shall throw our rings into its midst and stone them with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">50</xref></sup> Ergo (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to Sennacherib. (Ibid., cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. These refer to his children. When he went up to destroy Jerusalem, he did not succeed. [It is so stated] (in II Kings 19:35 &#x003D; Is. 37:36): <small>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C; ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-THOUSAND &#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA</small>&#x2026;. It is also written (in II Chron. 32:21): <small>&#x003C; THEN THE LORD SENT AN ANGEL, WHO DESTROYED EVERY MIGHTY WARRIOR, COMMANDER, AND OFFICER IN THE CAMP OF THE KING OF ASSYRIA. &#x003E; SO HE RETURNED SHAMEFACED TO HIS OWN LAND. THEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE OF HIS GOD</small>, [<small>SOME OF</small>] <small>THOSE WHO CAME OUT OF HIS OWN BELLY</small> &#x007B;<small>SMOTE HIM WITH THE SWORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>STRUCK HIM DOWN THERE WITH THE SWORD</small>]. [When he went in to pray before his god Nisroch, his children spoke thus: This one is deceiving himself. They had been a pillar for him. When all his troops were burned, they were pining away.<sup><xref rid="fn1043">51</xref></sup> So they killed him.] It is so stated (in II Kings 19:37): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, AS HE WAS WORSHIPING IN THE HOUSE OF HIS GOD NISROCH, HIS SONS ADRAMMELECK AND SAREZER SMOTE HIM WITH THE SWORD</small>. Ergo (in Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to Sennacherib. (Ibid., cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to his children.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is stated (in Is. 14:13): <small>I WILL ASCEND TO THE HEAVENS; &#x003C; ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD I WILL SET MY THRONE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. (Hab. 1:7, cont.:) <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to Evil-merodach (his son). Our masters have said: When Nebuchadnezzar was driven away, just as it is written (in Dan. 4:29 [32]): <small>YOU SHALL BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HUMANKIND</small>; all that time Evil-merodach served in his place. Then when he returned, he put him in prison. Now whoever was imprisoned by him never emerged from the prison until the day of his death. Thus it is stated (in Is. 14:17): <small>HE NEVER RELEASED HIS PRISONERS TO THEIR HOMES</small>. When Nebuchadnezzar died, they wanted to make Evil-merodach king. They approached him, but he did not accept. He said to them: I listened to you the first time. For that reason I was imprisoned. So shall I listen to you now? Perhaps he is alive. Then he will rise up against me and kill me. They stood over Nebuchadnezzar, dragged him from his grave, and brought him out. Then he saw that he was dead, and they made him king. &#x003C; This act was &#x003E; to fulfill what is stated (in Is. 14:19): <small>AND YOU HAVE BEEN CAST FROM YOUR GRAVE LIKE A DETESTABLE OFFSHOOT</small>. Ergo (in Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIMSELF</small>. This refers to Evil-merodach.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Hab. 1:7): <small>TERRIBLE AND DREADFUL</small>. This refers to the human race, which rules over all which the Holy One has created in his world. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 8:7 [6]): <small>YOU HAVE SET HIM AS RULER OVER THE</small> &#x007B;<small>WORK</small>&#x007D; [<small>WORKS</small>] <small>OF YOUR HANDS</small>&#x2026;. (Hab. 1:7, cont.:) <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIM</small>. Thus when he sins, he brings upon himself torments from his &#x003C; own &#x003E; body. Why? Because his ways are not like the ways of flesh and blood. When &#x003C; a person of &#x003E; flesh and blood wants to punish his slaves, he brings &#x007B;kneaders&#x007D; [whips] and fetters, to punish them and cause them pain; but the Holy One is not like that. Rather it is from a person&#x2019;s whole body that he punishes and beats him. &#x007B;Thus it is stated (in Hab. 1:7, cont.): <small>HIS JUSTICE AND HIS DIGNITY PROCEED FROM HIM</small>.&#x007D; [From where is it shown? From what we have read on the matter (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, AND IT BECOMES ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY, HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO AARON THE PRIEST &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. ]</p>
<title>4.11 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 13:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>. &#x003C; This verse is able &#x003E; to teach you that the Holy One does not delight in convicting a person,<sup><xref rid="fn1044">52</xref></sup> as stated (in Ezek. 18:32): <small>FOR I DO NOT DELIGHT IN THE DEATH OF ONE WHO DIES</small>. In what does he delight? In vindicating (rt.: <italic><small>TsDQ</small></italic>) his people. [Thus it is stated (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &#x003C; SERVANT&#x2019;</small>S <small>&#x003E; VINDICATION</small> (<italic><small>TsDQ</small></italic>)&#x2026;,<sup><xref rid="fn1045">53</xref></sup> &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; because of his people&#x2019;s vindication (<italic><small>TsDQ</small></italic>)] and not &#x003C; their &#x003E; conviction. So also you find that in the case of the first Adam, when he created him, he set him in the Garden of Eden. Then he gave him a command and said to him: Eat this, but do not eat from this, <small>FOR</small> (according to Gen. 2:17) <small>ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOU SHALL SURELY DIE</small>. &#x003C; When &#x003E; he transgressed, he brought a sentence<sup><xref rid="fn1046">54</xref></sup> upon himself. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; the Sabbath came, and he acquitted him.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">55</xref></sup> He began to talk with him &#x003C; about &#x003E; whether he would repent? It is so stated (in Gen. 3:9): <small>THE LORD GOD CALLED UNTO THE HUMAN. THE LORD</small> can only mean the quality of mercy, as stated (in Exod. 34:6): <small>THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD</small>. For him he had the quality of mercy precede the quality of strict justice. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>, in that he does not delight in convicting a person. He began to talk (in Gen. 3:11&#x2013;12): <small>WHO TOLD YOU &#x003C; THAT YOU WERE NAKED? DID YOU EAT FROM THE TREE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;? <small>THEN THE MAN SAID: THE WOMAN</small>&#x2026;. He left Adam alone and began to talk with the woman, as stated (in vs. 13): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD SAID TO THE WOMAN</small>&#x2026;. But when he came to the serpent he did not talk with him. Instead he immediately gave him a sentence, as stated (in vss. 14&#x2013;15): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, &#x003C; MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>I WILL PUT ENMITY &#x003C; BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; he returned to the woman and said to her (in vs. 16): <small>I WILL GREATLY MULTIPLY YOUR PAIN IN PREGNANCY</small>. And when he returned to the man, he did not convict him. Rather he intimated to him that he should repent. Where is it shown? R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Levi that he said to him (in vs. 19): <small>BY THE SWEAT OF YOUR BROW SHALL EAT BREAD, UNTIL YOU RETURN &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. YOU RETURN</small> can only be an expression for repentance, since it is stated (in Hos. 14:2 [1]): <small>RETURN O ISRAEL, &#x003C; TO THE LORD YOUR GOD &#x003E;</small>. When &#x003C; Adam &#x003E; did not repent, he expelled him from the Garden of Eden, as stated [(in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND HE DROVE OUT THE MAN</small>. Ergo] (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Tanhuma bar Hanila&#x2019;i in the name of R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Johanan: Before the Holy One stand only angels of peace and angels of mercy, but the angels of wrath are far from him. It is so stated (in Is. 13:5): <small>THEY COME FROM A FAR LAND FROM THE END OF THE HEAVENS, EVEN THE LORD AND THE WEAPONS OF HIS WRATH, TO RAVAGE THE WHOLE EARTH</small>. [Another interpretation] (of Ps. 5:5 [4], cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Johanan said: If you do not pursue evil, evil will not pursue you, nor will it dwell with you.</p>
<title>4.12 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 5:5 [4], cont.): <small>EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said in the name of R. Johanan: The name of the Holy One is not mentioned in connection with evil but only in connection with good. You know that it is so. When the Holy One created the light and the darkness and gave them names, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentioned his name in connection with the light but did not mention his name in connection with the darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">56</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 1:5): <small>AND GOD CALLED THE LIGHT DAY, AND THE DARKNESS HE CALLED NIGHT</small>. So also you find that, when he created Adam and Eve, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentioned his name in connection with them, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM</small>&#x2026;; but when he cursed them, it did not mention his name in connection with them. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:16&#x2013;17): <small>AND UNTO THE WOMAN <italic>HE</italic> SAID</small>&#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; <small>AND UNTO ADAM <italic>HE</italic> SAID</small>&#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; Now if you say: &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentioned &#x003C; his name &#x003E; in connection with the serpent when he cursed him, [since it is written (in Gen. 3:14): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE &#x003C; THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD</small>&#x2026;. &#x003E;]; the sages have taught this: The Holy One has mentioned his name in connection with three things, even though they stood for evil:</p>
<ol>
<li>In connection with the inciter, i.e., the serpent, when he incited the woman and said (in Gen. 3:5): <small>FOR GOD KNOWS &#x003C; THAT ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. So because he incited, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentions his name in connection with &#x003C; the serpent &#x003E;.</li>
<li>In connection with one who transgresses the words of the sages, as is stated (in Jer. 11:3): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small>, [<small>THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>]: <small>CURSED IS THE ONE WHO DOES NOT HEED</small>&#x2026;.</li>
<li>In connection with one who makes flesh and blood his patron,<sup><xref rid="fn1049">57</xref></sup> as stated (in Jer. 17:5): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: CURSED IS THE MAN WHO TRUSTS IN A HUMAN BEING, WHO MAKES FLESH HIS STRENGTH AND WHOSE HEART TURNS FROM THE LORD</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So also you find in the case of Noah, &#x003C; that Scripture used the name &#x003E; when he blessed his sons, as stated (in Gen. 9:26): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF SHEM</small>&#x2026;; but when he cursed Canaan, [&#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; did not mention the name of the Holy One in connection with him], as stated (in vs. 25): <small>AND HE SAID: CURSED BE CANAAN</small>&#x2026;. So also you find in the case of Elisha the Prophet, that when the king of Aram came to fight against Israel, he consulted with his servants and made <italic>phossata</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1050">58</xref></sup> for them. He said: When Israel comes to fight against us, they will fall into the midst of the <italic>phossata</italic> &#x007B;i.e., trenches&#x007D;, as stated (in II Kings 6:8&#x2013;9): <small>WHEN THE KING OF ARAM WAS FIGHTING AGAINST ISRAEL, HE CONSULTED WITH HIS SERVANTS, SAYING: MY CAMP SHALL BE IN SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE; BUT THE MAN OF GOD SENT UNTO THE KING OF ISRAEL</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>TAKE CARE NOT TO PASS</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; <small>THIS PLACE, BECAUSE THE ARAMAEANS ARE CAMPING THERE</small>. So the Holy One does nothing (according to Amos 3:7) <small>WITHOUT HAVING REVEALED HIS PURPOSE UNTO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>. When Israel passed by once and twice without falling, the king of Aram took notice and said to his servants (in II Kings 6:11): <small>WILL YOU NOT TELL ME WHICH OF US IS FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL</small>? His servants said to him (in vs. 12&#x2013;14): <small>&#x003C; IT IS &#x003E; BECAUSE ELISHA, THE PROPHET THAT IS IN ISRAEL, TELLS THE KING OF ISRAEL THE WORDS WHICH YOU SPEAK IN YOUR BEDROOM. SO HE SAID: GO AND SEE &#x003C; WHERE HE IS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>THEN HE SENT HORSES AND CHARIOTS THERE</small>. Immediately (in vss. 15&#x2013;16): <small>&#x003C; HIS SERVANT &#x003E; CRIED OUT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1051">59</xref></sup> <small>AND SAID &#x003C; UNTO HIM &#x003E;</small>: <small>ALAS, MY LORD, WHAT SHALL WE DO? THEN HE SAID: FEAR NOT, FOR THERE ARE MORE WITH US THAN WITH THEM</small>. Immediately Elisha prayed to the name of the Holy One, as stated (in vs. 17): <small>THEN ELISHA PRAYED AND SAID: LORD, PLEASE OPEN HIS EYES AND LET HIM SEE. SO THE LORD OPENED THE EYES OF THE SERVANT AND HE SAW, AND THERE WAS THE HILL FULL OF FIERY HORSES AND CHARIOTS ROUND ABOUT ELISHA</small>&#x0021; Immediately Elisha arose and cursed the Aramaeans (in vs. 18), <small>AND HE SAID</small> [<small>PLEASE</small>] <small>SMITE THIS NATION WITH A BLINDING LIGHT; SO HE SMOTE THEM WITH A BLINDING LIGHT ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF ELISHA</small>. Now &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; did not mention the name, but when &#x003C; Elisha &#x003E; prayed over them again for their eyes to be opened, he said (in vs. 20): <small>O LORD, OPEN</small> [<small>THE EYES OF THESE MEN THAT THEY MAY SEE</small>.] Ergo: The name of the Holy One is not mentioned in connection with evil. So also you find that, when the angels of destruction came to destroy Jerusalem, as stated (in Ezek. 9:2): <small>AND HERE WERE SIX PERSONS COMING &#x003C; BY WAY OF THE UPPER GATE WHICH FACES NORTH, EACH WITH HIS WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION IN HIS HAND; AND A CERTAIN ONE IN THEIR MIDST CLOTHED IN LINEN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;; <small>&#x003C; AND THEY CAME FORWARD AND STOOD BY THE BRONZE ALTAR &#x003E;</small>; the Holy One said to Gabriel: Fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city, as it is written (in Ezek. 10:2): <small>THEN HE SPOKE UNTO THE PERSON CLOTHED IN LINEN &#x003C; AND SAID: GO IN AMONG THE WHEELWORK, UNDER THE CHERUB, AND FILL YOUR HANDS WITH COALS OF FIRE FROM AMONG THE CHERUBIM, AND SCATTER THEM OVER THE CITY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1052">60</xref></sup> Gabriel came and stood at the wheel. The cherub said to him: What do you desire? He said to him: Thus and so has the Holy One commanded me. He said to him: Take them. He said to him: You put them in my hand. (Ezek. 10:7:) <small>THEN THE CHERUB STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND FROM AMONG THE CHERUBIM &#x003C; UNTO THE FIRE THAT WAS AMONG THE CHERUBIM</small>&#x2026;. &#x003E; R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay: If the coals had not been cooled off &#x003C; while passing &#x003E; from the hand of a cherub to the hand of Gabriel, there would not have remained of the enemies of Israel a &#x003C; single &#x003E; survivor or refugee.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">61</xref></sup> So the Holy One wanted to do what was evil, not by himself, but through an angel. In the age to come, however, he will do what is good by himself, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>FOR YOU ARE NOT A GOD WHO DELIGHTS IN WICKEDNESS; EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>4.13 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>[Another interpretation:] What is the meaning of (Ps. 5:5 [4]:) <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>? &#x003C; It is &#x003E; that &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; does not cause the name of the Holy One to rest upon evil, except for two &#x003C; evil &#x003E; sayings upon which the Holy One did cause his name to rest. These are the following: (Dan. 9:14:) <small>SO THE <italic>LORD</italic> WATCHED OVER EVIL AND BROUGHT IT UPON US, BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>. Was it because <small>THE <italic>LORD</italic> OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>, that <small>HE WATCHED OVER EVIL</small>? It is simply that the Holy One acted justly when he first brought about the exile to Babylon of Jeconiah along with the artisans, the smiths, and all those mighty in the Torah. Now they went down to Babylon and created an academy for Torah; for if it had not happened like that, the Torah would have been forgotten in the Exile. It is simply that those who believed in the words of Jeremiah went forth with the Torah. &#x003C; They included &#x003E; (according to II Kings 24:16) <small>A THOUSAND ARTISANS AND SMITHS</small>. What is the meaning of <small>ARTISANS</small> (<italic><small>HRSh</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn1054">62</xref></sup> When they opened the Torah they all became as those who are deaf (<italic><small>HRSh</small></italic>). &#x003C; And what is the meaning of &#x003E; <small>SMITHS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SGR</small></italic>)? After they closed (rt.: <italic><small>SGR</small></italic>) it, there was no one in all Israel who was able to open it. Ergo (in Dan. 9:14): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD IS HOLY</small>.</p>
<p>So he acted justly during that exile in that he watched over it, and he still performed a great kindness for &#x003C; Israel &#x003E; with reference to that exile. How? In &#x003C; the month of &#x003E; Tebet they were scheduled to go into exile from Jerusalem, for so does &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; say (in Ezek. 24:1&#x2013;2): <small>&#x003C; THEN THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME UNTO ME IN THE NINTH YEAR OF THE TENTH MONTH ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE MONTH, SAYING &#x003E;: SON OF ADAM, WRITE DOWN THE NAME OF THE DAY</small>, [<small>THIS VERY DAY</small>;] <small>ON THIS VERY DAY THE KING OF BABYLON LAID SIEGE TO JERUSALEM</small>. What did the Holy One do? He said: If they go forth now in the cold, they will die. What did he do for them? He waited for them and sent them into exile during the summer.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">63</xref></sup> This is what the prophet says (in Jer. 8:13): <small>I WILL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM, SAYS THE LORD</small>. &#x201C;Destroy&#x201D; (&#x2018;<small><italic>SP</italic></small>) can only mean &#x201C;exile,&#x201D; since it is stated (in Zeph. 1:2): <small>I WILL REMOVE</small> (&#x2018;<small><italic>SP</italic></small>) <small>ALL THINGS &#x003C; FROM THE FACE THE EARTH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Now, the second &#x003C; evil saying associated with the name of the Holy One &#x003E; is (Ezek. 9:4:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM: PASS THROUGH THE MIDST OF THE CITY, THROUGH THE MIDST OF JERUSALEM AND MARK &#x003C; THE LETTER &#x003E;</small> <italic><small>TAW</small></italic><sup><xref rid="fn1056">64</xref></sup> <small>ON THE FOREHEADS OF THOSE PEOPLE &#x003C; WHO MOAN AND GROAN OVER ALL THE ABOMINATIONS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to Gabriel: Go and write an ink <italic>taw</italic> upon the foreheads of the righteous, so that the angels of destruction will have no dominion over them. Then upon the foreheads of the wicked write a blood <italic>taw</italic> so that the angels of destruction will have dominion over them. &#x003C; The &#x003E; prosecution<sup><xref rid="fn1057">65</xref></sup> came in before the Holy One, [it said to him]: Sovereign of the World, how do the former differ from the latter? He said to it: The former are completely righteous, and the latter are completely wicked. It said to him: It was in their power to protest, but they did not protest. He said to it: It was revealed and known to me that, if they had protested, they would not have accepted their &#x003C; protest &#x003E;. It said to him: Sovereign of the World, how does the one group differ from the other. After all, it was in their power to demean themselves for the sanctification of your name and take beatings from Israel upon themselves, just as the prophets endured &#x003C; them &#x003E;. So look at how many woes Jeremiah suffered from Israel; also Isaiah, of whom it is written (in Is. 50:6): <small>I GAVE MY BACK TO THE SMITERS</small>&#x2026;., and the rest of the prophets. Immediately (in Ezek. 9:6) he spoke again to the angels of destruction: [<small>KILL OFF</small>] <small>OLD FOLK, YOUTH, MAIDENS, SMALL CHILDREN, AND WOMEN, &#x003C; BUT DO NOT TOUCH ANYONE WHO BEARS THE <italic>TAV</italic> UPON HIMSELF &#x003E;</small>. This also was a kindness, in that the Holy One &#x007B;interceded with&#x007D; [mitigated] his wrath against Jerusalem, as stated (in Lam. 4:11): <small>THE LORD HAS COMPLETED</small> (<italic><small>KLH</small></italic>) <small>HIS WRATH</small>. For if he had not done so, all Israel would have received a verdict of destruction (<italic><small>KLYH</small></italic>). Ergo (in Ps. 5:5 [4]): <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>, because the Holy One does not cause his name to rest upon evil. So also in the case of Israel, he allotted them glory and did not mention them for evil. When he came to the offerings, he said to Moses (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; <small>OF YOU</small>, and not the peoples of the world. However, when he came to mention leprosy spots, he said (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. It does not say: &#x201C;One of you,&#x201D; but <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 5:5): <small>AND EVIL MAY NOT ABIDE WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>4.14 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &#x003E;</small>. It is difficult for the Holy One to reach out his hand against a human being.<sup><xref rid="fn1058">66</xref></sup> Rather he forewarns a person and afflicts his house, as stated (in Lev. 14:34): <small>AND WHEN I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, fine; but if not, it afflicted his clothes, as stated (in Lev. 13:47): <small>WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, fine; but if not, &#x003C; comes &#x003E; upon his body, as stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>4.15 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003C; A SWELLING OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT &#x003E;</small>. Why do the plagues come?<sup><xref rid="fn1059">67</xref></sup> Because of harlotry. And so you find in Jerusalem, that because they were absorbed in harlotry, they were afflicted with leprosy. What is written there (in Is. 3:16)? <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD SAID: BECAUSE &#x003C; THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION &#x003E; ARE HAUGHTY, &#x003C; AND WALK WITH EXTENDED NECK AND ROVING EYES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Then it says (in vs. 17): <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) <small>THE SCALPS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION</small>. [<small>SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1060">68</xref></sup> must mean &#x201C;with leprosy,&#x201D; since it is stated (with reference to leprosy in Lev. 13:2): <small>A SWELLING OR A SORE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SPH</small></italic>).]<sup><xref rid="fn1061">69</xref></sup> It also says (in Lev. 14:56): <small>FOR A SWELLING AND FOR A SORE</small>.</p>
<title>4.16 Leviticus 13:1ff, Part IX</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 13:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH A SWELLING</small> (<italic><small>S&#x2019;T</small></italic>) <small>OR A SORE OR A BRIGHT SPOT, &#x003C; AND IT BECOMES &#x003E;</small> &#x2026; <small>THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; is speaking about four empires.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">70</xref></sup> The <small>SWELLING</small> represents Babylon, since it is stated (in Is. 14:4): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE UP</small> (<italic><small>NS&#x2019;T</small></italic>) <small>THIS SONG OF SCORN AGAINST THE KING OF BABYLON AND SAY</small>&#x2026;. The <small>SORE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) represents Media, because Haman conspired (rt.: <italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) with Ahasuerus to devastate, kill, and destroy. The <small>BRIGHT SPOT</small> represents the Greek empire.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">71</xref></sup> <small>THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY</small> represents the wicked empire of Edom (i.e., of Rome), because the Holy One afflicted it and its prince with leprosy, as stated (in Jer. 46:15): <small>WHY HAS <italic>ABBIREKA</italic> BEEN WASHED AWAY</small>?&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">72</xref></sup> In the world to come the Holy One shall sit in judgment over the wicked empire. He will say to them: Why did you oppress my children? They will say: It was you that acted, when you delivered them into our hands. Then the Holy One will say to them: Because (to paraphrase Is. 47:6) I delivered them into your hands, did you not show them mercy? Instead (according to Is. 47:6, cont.): <small>UPON THE AGED YOU MADE YOUR YOKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY</small>. This &#x003C; aged one &#x003E; is Rabbi Aqiva, whom the empire oppressed, &#x003C; the empire &#x003E; which has no end.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 47:6, cont.): <small>UPON THE AGED YOU MADE YOUR YOKE EXCEEDINGLY HEAVY</small>. Because they made their yoke as heavy on the aged as upon the youth, the Holy One said to them: By your life, I am sitting over you in judgment to judge you and convict you. Thus it is stated (in Is. 47:1): <small>COME DOWN AND SIT UPON THE DUST, O MAIDEN DAUGHTER OF BABYLON; SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE, O CHALDEAN DAUGHTER</small>&#x2026;. It is calling Edom the <small>DAUGHTER OF BABYLON</small>, and it is calling Edom the <small>CHALDEAN DAUGHTER</small>. So what is the meaning of <small>DAUGHTER OF BABYLON</small>? Babylon&#x2019;s twin sister. Just as Babylon destroyed my house, so also has this one destroyed my house. Ergo (in Is. 47:1): <small>O DAUGHTER OF BABYLON, SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE</small>. Since she formerly sat upon a throne, now &#x003C; she is told &#x003E; <small>SIT ON THE EARTH, NOT A THRONE</small>, &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>FOR YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED</small> &#x007B;<small>THE TENDER AND DELICATE ONE</small>&#x007D; [<small>TENDER AND DELICATE</small>]. Since she pampered herself over against my children, therefore &#x003C; she is told &#x003E; <small>YOU SHALL NO MORE BE CALLED TENDER AND DELICATE</small>. What shall I do to you? I will exact retribution from your prince and smite him with leprosy. Then after that, I will exact retribution from you. You should not say: In this empire &#x003C; only &#x003E;, but even upon Gog, since he vaunts himself upward in the world. I will smite him with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE WITH WHICH THE LORD WILL SMITE ALL THE PEOPLES WHO HAVE WARRED AGAINST JERUSALEM: &#x003C; THEIR FLESH SHALL ROT AWAY</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> For what reason? Because they engaged in battle with Israel. <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE</small>. For what reason? Because they <small>WARRED AGAINST JERUSALEM</small>. And do not be surprised that the Lord exacts retribution in leprosy from those who hate them even in this world. And who was &#x003C; such a one &#x003E;? This was Naaman, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 5:1): <small>NOW NAAMAN, THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF ARAM</small>&#x2026;; <small>BUT THE MAN, THOUGH A VALIANT WARRIOR, WAS A LEPER</small>. For what reason was he a leper? Because he had taken a little girl captive from the land of Israel. And also in the world to come the Holy One will afflict them with leprosy, as stated (in Zech. 14:12): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE PLAGUE</small>. The Holy One said: Because you have called my children unclean, I am making you unclean with a great uncleanness through leprosy. Where is it shown that they called Israel unclean? Where it is stated (in Lam. 4:15) <small>AWAY, UNCLEAN, THEY CRIED AT THEM</small>. In the case of Israel, however, I will sanctify, purify, and redeem them from among you, as stated (in Is. 62:12): <small>AND THEY SHALL CALL THEM THE HOLY PEOPLE, THE REDEEMED OF THE LORD</small>. So also Solomon has said (in Cant. 4:7): <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED, AND THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 5 Leviticus, Parashah V: <italic>Metsora&#x2018;</italic></title>
<title>5.1 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many children of Adam have no share in the world to come?<sup><xref rid="fn1066">1</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in Sanh. 10:1&#x2013;2): <small>THESE ARE THEY WHO HAVE NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME</small>&#x2026;. <small>THREE KINGS AND FOUR COMMONERS</small><sup><xref rid="fn1067">2</xref></sup> <small>HAVE NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME. THE THREE KINGS ARE JEROBOAM, AHAB, AND MANASSEH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">3</xref></sup> R. Judah ben Shallum the Levite said: The sages of the Mishnah wanted to teach that there were four kings and reckon Solomon with them; however, a heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) came forth and said (in the words of Ps. 105:15): <small>TOUCH NOT MY ANOINTED</small>. Nevertheless they returned one day to teaching &#x003C; as before &#x003E;. Fire from the heavens came and destroyed their benches. &#x003C; The heavenly voice &#x003E; returned and said (according to Job 34:33): <small>SHOULD HE REPAY AS YOU WOULD, WHEN YOU HAVE REFUSED</small>? All the same, why did they so teach? Because it is written (in I Kings 11:1, 6): <small>NOW KING SOLOMON LOVED MANY FOREIGN WIVES</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; <small>AND SOLOMON DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD</small>. (<italic>Sanh.</italic> 10:2, at the end:) <small>THE FOUR COMMONERS ARE BALAAM, DOEG, AHITHOPHEL AND GEHAZI</small>. You find that these were condemned to Gehinnom on account of the words of their mouths. In the case of Balaam, he was driven into Gehinnom because of his speech, as stated (in Numb. 23:7): <small>FROM ARAM HAS BALAK BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB &#x003C; FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST: COME, CURSE JACOB FOR ME</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn1069">4</xref></sup> &#x003C; He said: &#x003E; I was one of the exalted ones;<sup><xref rid="fn1070">5</xref></sup> I was one of the division of &#x003C; the &#x003E; patriarchs. <small>BALAK BROUGHT ME</small> (<italic>yanheni</italic>) and cast me into Gehinnom. Now <small>BROUGHT ME</small> (<italic>yanheni</italic>, rt.: <italic><small>NHH</small></italic>) can only imply Gehinnom, since it is stated (in Ezek. 32:18): <small>SON OF ADAM, BRING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NHH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1071">6</xref></sup> <small>THE MASSES OF EGYPT AND CAST THEM DOWN</small>&#x2026; <small>&#x003C; UNTO THE LOWEST PART OF THE NETHER WORLD ALONG WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT &#x003E;</small>. So also was Doeg banished because of his speech. When? When David fled to Nob, the city of priests &#x007B;to Ahimelech&#x007D;, where Ahimelech received him, Saul noticed and gathered all his servants. He said to them: A fine way you are treating me&#x0021; For David does whatever he wishes, and not one of you has put a word in my ear. It is so stated (in I Sam. 22:8): <small>IS THAT WHY ALL OF YOU HAVE CONSPIRED</small> [<small>AGAINST ME? FOR NO ONE IS PUTTING A WORD IN MY EAR</small>] &#x003C; <small>WHEN MY SON IS MAKING A DEAL WITH THE SON OF JESSE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Doeg began to utter evil speech, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>THEN DOEG THE EDOMITE, WHO WAS STANDING AMONG THE SERVANTS OF SAUL, &#x003C; ANSWERED AND SAID: I SAW THE SON OF JESSE COME TO NOB</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> It was also by his hand that eighty-five priests who wear the ephod and the high priest Ahimelech were slain. And he smote Nob the city of priests with the edge of the sword. So also was Ahithophel banished because of his speech. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 17:23): <small>SO WHEN AHITHOPHEL SAW THAT HIS COUNSEL WAS NOT HEEDED</small>&#x2026;. <small>THEN HE SET HIS HOUSE IN ORDER AND HANGED HIMSELF</small>. Gehazi also was banished on account of his speech. When Naaman became leprous and was healed at the hands of Elisha, Naaman began to give silver, gold and gifts<sup><xref rid="fn1072">7</xref></sup> to Elisha, but he did not want to accept them. Now Gehazi was ministering to Elisha. He saw the silver, the gold, and the clothes; so he said (in II Kings 5:20, 21, 27): <small>MY LORD HAS SPARED &#x003C; THAT ARAMEAN &#x003E; NAAMAN</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; THEN GEHAZI CHASED AFTER NAAMAN</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E; THEREFORE THE LEPROSY OF NAAMAN</small> [<small>SHALL CLEAVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER</small>]. Why? Because it is stated (in Deut. 13:18): <small>AND LET NOTHING CLEAVE TO YOUR HAND OF THAT WHICH IS DEVOTED</small>. Now Naaman and the king of Aram served idols; and it is written (in Deut. 7:26): <small>DO NOT BRING AN ABOMINATION UNTO YOUR HOUSE</small>&#x2026;. Since you said (in II Kings 5:20): <small>AND I WILL ACCEPT SOMETHING FROM</small> &#x007B;<small>HIS HAND</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIM</small>], by your life, you shall &#x003C; also &#x003E; take his deformity. Thus it is stated (in vs. 27): <small>THEREFORE THE LEPROSY OF NAAMAN SHALL CLEAVE TO YOU</small>. R. Pedat said: The Holy One has made a covenant with the world that anyone who utters evil speech receives leprosy. Where is it shown? From what is written on the matter (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<italic>hametsora</italic>&#x2018;), &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; the one who proclaims evil (<italic>hamotsi&#x2019; ra</italic>&#x2018;).<sup><xref rid="fn1073">8</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.2 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] Our masters have said: Plagues only affect a person on account of the evil speech which comes out of his mouth. So the Holy Spirit cries out (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; to afflict your body. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>,] &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; and do not say before the angel who is appointed over you: By mistake I brought forth the word from my mouth; for every word which issues from your mouth, whether good, evil, by mistake, or on purpose, is written in a book.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">9</xref></sup> Where is it shown that it is so? Where it is stated (in Mal. 3:16): <small>THEN THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD SPOKE WITH ONE ANOTHER</small>. [<small>THE LORD HAS HEARKENED AND LISTENED, AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE HIM</small>&#x2026;. ] And so when in severe trouble, David said (in Ps. 139:2, 4): <small>YOU KNOW WHEN I SIT DOWN AND WHEN I STAND UP</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; FOR THERE IS NOT A WORD ON MY TONGUE, BUT THAT YOU, O LORD, KNOW IT FULLY</small>. <small>&#x003E;</small> Job also said (in Job 13:27): <small>YOU LOOK CLOSELY OVER MY FOOTSTEPS</small>. (Eccl. 5:5 [6], cont.:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>? These are the hands and the body when they are afflicted by leprosy.</p>
<title>5.3 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH &#x003C; CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN &#x003E;</small>. The Torah has spoken to you euphemistically. If your wife has told you that she is menstruating, do not cause your body to sin by touching her. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> who is appointed over the formation of the fetus: I made a mistake and did not know. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>? This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy. R. Aha said: If a man has intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating, the children will be afflicted with leprosy. How? &#x003C; If &#x003E; he has intercourse on the first day of her menstruation, the child which is born shall be afflicted after ten years. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he has intercourse with her on the second day, it shall be afflicted after twenty years. On the third day it shall be afflicted after thirty years. On the fourth day it shall be afflicted after forty years. On the fifth day it shall be afflicted after fifty years. On the sixth day it shall be afflicted after sixty years. On the seventh day it shall be afflicted after seventy years, corresponding to the seven days of her menstruation. Moreover, he shall not depart from the world before he has seen his fruit spoiled. Now the days of a person&#x2019;s life are only seventy years, for so David says (in Ps. 90:10): <small>THE DAYS OF OUR LIFE COMPRISE SEVENTY YEARS</small>. And if one is successful, &#x003C; then &#x003E; eighty, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND IF ONE HAS STRENGTH, &#x003C; THEN &#x003E; EIGHTY YEARS</small>. Therefore if a man has intercourse with a menstruating woman on the seventh day, the fetus is afflicted at seventy years of age, so that he does not depart from the world until he has seen his fruit spoiled. This punishment, as it were, does not come from me? I have already testified to you and told you (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT LET YOUR MOUTH &#x003C; CAUSE YOUR FLESH TO SIN, AND DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE &#x003E;</small>. If you have acted with malice aforethought and led astray a high priest, who is called an angel (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7): <small>FOR THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE, AND THEY SHOULD SEEK TORAH FROM HIS MOUTH; FOR HE IS THE MESSENGER</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>OF THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>; then do not say: I sinned by mistake, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; (in Eccl. 5:5 [6]): <small>DO NOT SAY BEFORE THE ANGEL</small> (i.e., before the high priest) <small>THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE</small>. Why? You are leading yourself astray. You are afflicting yourself. The voice which you send forth from your mouth will destroy the work of your hands. (Eccl. 5:5 [6]:) <small>WHY SHOULD GOD BE ANGRY OVER YOUR VOICE</small> [<small>AND DESTROY THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS</small>]? This refers to the children who are afflicted with leprosy. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5.4 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>. Everything depends on the tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">10</xref></sup> &#x003C; If &#x003E; one is acquitted, he is acquitted for life; &#x003C; if &#x003E; one is not acquitted, he is condemned to death. &#x003C; If &#x003E; one is engaged in Torah with his tongue, he is acquitted for life, inasmuch as the Torah [is called life, according to what is stated] (in Prov. 3:18): <small>&#x003C; WISDOM &#x003E; IS A TREE OF LIFE TO THOSE WHO TAKE HOLD OF IT</small>. It (i.e., the Torah) is also one&#x2019;s healing for the evil tongue (i.e., slander), as stated (in Prov. 15:4): <small>A HEALING TONGUE IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>. But if one is occupied with slander, his soul is condemned to death, since slander is more harmful than the shedding of blood. Thus whoever kills takes only one life, but the one who speaks slander kills three people: the one who tells it, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom it is told.<sup><xref rid="fn1076">11</xref></sup> Doeg spoke slander against Ahimelech; and he (i.e., Ahimelech) was killed, [as stated] (in I Sam. 22:16): <small>BUT</small> &#x007B;<small>SAUL</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE KING</small>] <small>SAID: YOU SHALL SURELY DIE, AHIMELECH</small>. Saul also was killed, [as stated] (in I Chron. 10:13): <small>&#x003C; SO SAUL DIED &#x003E; FOR THE TREACHERY WHICH HE HAD COMMITTED AGAINST THE LORD</small>. And thus did Saul say (in II Sam. 1:9, to a young man): <small>PLEASE STAND OVER ME AND SLAY ME, FOR DEATH THROES HAVE SEIZED ME</small>. &#x003C; The young man was &#x003E; the accuser<sup><xref rid="fn1077">12</xref></sup> of Nob, the city of priests. Now <small>DEATH THROES</small> (<italic><small>ShBTs</small></italic>) can only denote priesthood, since it is stated (in Exod. 28:13 with reference to high-priestly dress): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE GOLD BROCADE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShBTs</small></italic>). Doeg also was uprooted (<italic><small>ShRSh</small></italic>) from the life of this world and from all life in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 52:7 [5]): <small>GOD WILL ALSO TEAR YOU DOWN FOR EVER; HE WILL SEIZE YOU, TEAR YOU AWAY FROM YOUR TENT, AND UPROOT</small> (<italic><small>ShRSh</small></italic>) <small>YOU FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING. SELAH</small>. &#x003C; I.e., he will uproot you &#x003E; from life in the world to come. Who is more severe? One who smites with the sword or &#x003C; one who &#x003E; smites with the dart? [Say: The one who smites with the dart.] The one who smites with the sword is only able to kill his companion if he draws near to him and touches him; but in the case of one who smites with the dart, it is not so. Rather one throws the dart wherever he sees him. Therefore, one who speaks slander is comparable to the dart, as stated (in Jer. 9:7 [8]): <small>THEIR TONGUE IS A SHARPENED DART; IT SPEAKS DECEIT</small>. It also says (in Ps. 57:5 [4]): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ADAM, WHOSE TEETH ARE SPEARS AND DARTS</small>, [<small>AND WHOSE TONGUE A SHARP SWORD</small>]. See how harmful slander is, in that it is more harmful than adultery, blood shedding, and idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn1078">13</xref></sup> Of adultery it is written (in Gen. 39:9, where Joseph is addressing Potiphar&#x2019;s wife): <small>THEN HOW SHALL I DO THIS GREAT EVIL AND SIN AGAINST GOD</small>? Of blood shedding it is written (in Gen. 4:13): <small>AND CAIN SAID TO THE LORD: MY SIN IS GREATER THAN I CAN BEAR</small>. Of idolatry it is written (in Exod. 32:31, with reference to the golden calf): <small>ALAS, THIS PEOPLE HAS SINNED A GREAT SIN</small>. But when it (i.e., Scripture) mentions slander, it does not say &#x201C;great&#x201D; (in the masculine singular, as in Gen. 4:13), &#x201C;great&#x201D; in the feminine singular, as in Gen. 39:9 and Exod. 32:31), but &#x201C;great&#x201D; (in the feminine plural). Thus it is written (in Ps. 12:4 [3]): <small>THE LORD SHALL CUT OFF ALL FLATTERING LIPS, &#x003C; EVERY &#x003E; TONGUE SPEAKING GREAT THINGS</small> (in the feminine plural). It is therefore stated (in Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>.] Do not say: Since I have license to speak, I am therefore speaking whatever I want. See, the Torah has already enlightened you (in Ps. 34:14 [13]): <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL</small> [<small>AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT</small>]. Perhaps you will say that you are suffering a loss. Are you not profiting instead? So the Holy Spirit proclaims (in Prov. 21:23): <small>THE ONE WHO GUARDS HIS MOUTH AND HIS TONGUE GUARDS HIS SOUL FROM TROUBLE</small> (<italic>tsarot</italic>). Do not read this. Instead &#x003C; read &#x003E;, &#x201C;Guards his soul from leprosy (<italic>tsar&#x2018;at</italic>).&#x201D;</p>
<title>5.5 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21): <small>DEATH AND LIFE ARE IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE</small>. Slander is so harmful that one does not produce it from his mouth without denying the root (i.e., the existence of the Holy One).<sup><xref rid="fn1079">14</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 12:5 [4]): <small>THOSE WHO SAY: BY OUR TONGUES WE SHALL PREVAIL. OUR LIPS ARE WITH US. WHO IS TO BE OUR LORD</small>? The Holy One, as it were, cried out against those who speak slander (in Ps. 94:16): <small>WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS</small>&#x2026;? Who can stand against them? And who will stand against them? Gehinnom? But Gehinnom also cries out: I am unable to stand against them. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; the Holy One said: I &#x003C; will come at them &#x003E; from above and you (Gehinnom), from below. I will hurl darts from above; and you will turn on them with burning coals from below. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 120:3&#x2013;4): &#x003C; <small>WHAT SHALL BE GIVEN TO YOU, AND WHAT SHALL BE YOUR GAIN, YOU DECEITFUL TONGUE</small>? &#x003E; <small>SHARP DARTS OF THE WARRIOR ALONG WITH BURNING COALS OF BROOM WOOD</small>. The Holy One said to them (i.e., to Israel): Do you want to be delivered from Gehinnom? Keep yourselves far away from the deceitful tongue. Then you will be acquitted in this world and in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 34:13 [12]): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE AND LOVES &#x003C; MANY &#x003E; DAYS &#x003C; IN WHICH &#x003E; TO EXPERIENCE &#x003C; WHAT IS &#x003E; GOOD. WHO DESIRES LIFE</small>, concerns this world; <small>LOVES &#x003C; MANY &#x003E; DAYS</small>, refers to the world to come. It is therefore stated (in vs. 14 [13]): <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL &#x003C; AND YOUR LIPS FROM SPEAKING DECEIT &#x003E;</small>. Our masters have said: There is a story about a certain peddler who went around in the villages.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">15</xref></sup> Now he would call out and say: Who wants the elixir of life? The daughter of R. Jannay heard him. She said to her father: A certain peddler is going around and saying: Who wants the elixir of life? He said to her: Go and call him. She went and called him to R. Jannay. He said to him: Which elixir of life is it that you are selling? That peddler said to him: Pray, do not you know what this elixir is? He said to him: Even so, you inform me. He said to him: Bring me the book of Psalms. He brought it to him, and he unrolled it. Then he showed him what David had said (in Ps. 34:13&#x2013;14 [12&#x2013;13]): <small>WHO IS THE ONE WHO DESIRES LIFE</small>&#x2026;? <small>KEEP YOUR TONGUE FROM EVIL</small>&#x2026;. What did R. Jannay do? He gave him six sela&#x2018;im. His disciples said to him: Rabbi, did you not know this verse? He said to them: Yes, but this one came and explained it to me. &#x007B;Therefore leprosy comes upon whoever speaks slander. (Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.&#x007D; &#x003C; This story is &#x003E; to teach you that one who speaks slander will have plagues come upon him. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<italic>metsora</italic>&#x2018;), &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; the one who proclaims evil (<italic>motsi&#x2019; ra&#x2018;</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1081">16</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.6 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. Whoever speaks slander concerning his fellow will have leprosy come upon him. From where have you learned it? From Miriam.] See what is written about Miriam (in Numb. 12:1): <small>THEN MIRIAM AND AARON SPOKE AGAINST MOSES</small>. Therefore (in vs. 10): <small>THEN AARON TURNED UNTO MIRIAM, AND THERE WAS</small> [<small>MIRIAM</small>] <small>WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">17</xref></sup> What is written elsewhere (in Deut. 24:9)? <small>REMEMBER WHAT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID TO MIRIAM</small>. And what did she say against Moses? She said: Moses took (<italic>natal</italic>) a wife but ceased (<italic>batel</italic>) from being fruitful and multiplying.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">18</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do to them? He appeared to them, and they needed an immersion. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:4): <small>THEN THE LORD SUDDENLY SPOKE UNTO MOSES, UNTO AARON, AND UNTO MIRIAM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SUDDENLY</small>? That when he appeared unto them, they had need for water <small>SUDDENLY</small>. He spoke to them, and thus they had need for water.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">19</xref></sup> And I am speaking with you. Immediately Miriam became stricken with leprosy, as stated (in Numb. 12:10): <small>AND THERE WAS</small> [<small>MIRIAM</small>] <small>WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW</small>. Moreover, are not &#x003C; these &#x003E; words an argument a fortiori (<italic>qal wahomer</italic>)? For if Miriam had this happen, when she only spoke against her beloved brother when he was absent<sup><xref rid="fn1085">20</xref></sup> and was only intending to return him to his wife, how much the more so in the case of one who utters slander against his colleague? What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 24:8)? <small>TAKE CARE WITH THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY &#x003C; TO WATCH DILIGENTLY AND DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE PRIESTS AND LEVITES SHALL TEACH</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> So the hand of the Holy One also afflicted Aaron with it, when he was high priest. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:9): <small>AND THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST THEM</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; against Aaron and against Miriam. Aaron, however, was healed immediately; but Miriam, after seven days, as stated (in Numb. 12:15): <small>SO MIRIAM WAS SHUT UP</small> [<small>OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP</small>] <small>FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 14:2): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<italic>metsora&#x2018;</italic>). The one who proclaims evil (<italic>motsi&#x2019; ra</italic>&#x2018;) is the one who finds evil (<italic>motse&#x2019; ra</italic>&#x2018;).</p>
<title>5.7 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>[(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>.] And thus you find with the primeval serpent, because he spoke slander &#x003C; to Eve &#x003E; against his creator, for that reason he became leprous.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">21</xref></sup> What did he say? R. Joshua ben Levi said (citing Gen. <italic>3:5):</italic> <small>FOR GOD KNOWS THAT ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT</small>, <small>&#x003C; YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED &#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;.] He said to her: Every artisan hates his fellow &#x003C; artisan &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">22</xref></sup> Now when &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; wanted to create his world, he ate from this tree. So he created his world. You &#x003C; two &#x003E; also eat from it. Then you will be able to create like him. The Holy One said to &#x003C; the serpent &#x003E;: You have spoken slander. Your end is to be stricken with leprosy. It is so stated (in Gen. 3:14): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO THE SERPENT: &#x003C; BECAUSE YOU HAVE DONE THIS, MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE THAN ALL THE CATTLE, THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> With what did he curse him? With leprosy. Now a curse (&#x2018;<italic>arirah</italic>) can only be leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:52): <small>FOR IT IS A MALIGNANT</small> (<italic>mam&#x2019;eret</italic>) <small>LEPROSY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">23</xref></sup> R. Huna of Sha&#x2019;av said [in the name of] R. Joshua ben Levi: The scales &#x007B;i.e., the colors&#x007D; which are on the snake are his leprosy.<sup><xref rid="fn1089">24</xref></sup> And not only that, but when all the deformed are cured in the world to come, the snake shall not be cured.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">25</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:14): <small>MORE CURSED SHALL YOU BE THAN ALL THE CATTLE, &#x003C; THAN ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THAN ALL</small>? That they all shall be healed, but &#x003C; the serpent &#x003E; shall not be healed. The children of Adam shall be healed, as stated (in Is. 35:5&#x2013;6): &#x007B;<small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART</small>&#x2026;. &#x007D; <small>THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED</small>&#x2026;. [<small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART</small>&#x2026;. ] It is also written about the wild beasts and the cattle (in Is. 65:25): <small>THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER, &#x003C; AND THE LION LIKE THE OX SHALL EAT STRAW &#x003E;</small>; but the snake shall not have healing, since it is stated (ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE SERPENT&#x2019;S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>. R. Helbo said: Even though he may eat all the delicacies in the world, to him they only taste like dust. Moreover, it shall also be like this in the world to come. (Is. 65:25): <small>BUT THE SERPENT&#x2019;S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>, for he shall have no healing, because he &#x003C; was the one who &#x003E; brought mortals down to the dust. And what caused him to have &#x003C; this punishment &#x003E;? &#x003C; It happened &#x003E; because he had spoken slander. Ergo (in Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. In this book there are a lot of laws. &#x007B;(Lev. 7:1:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE GUILT OFFERING</small>.&#x007D; (Lev. 6:2 [9]:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE BURNT OFFERING</small>. [(Lev. 7:1:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE GUILT OFFERING</small>.] (Lev. 7:11:) <small>THIS IS THE LAW OF THE SACRIFICE FOR PEACE OFFERINGS</small>. And here also (in Lev. 14:2) I have established the law of the leper: <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5.8 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Lev. 14:2:) [<small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>:] <small>IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING</small>. With what?<sup><xref rid="fn1091">26</xref></sup> With (according to vs. 4) <small>TWO LIVE CLEAN BIRDS</small>. How is his offering different from all &#x003C; other &#x003E; offerings? It is simply that he has spoken slander; therefore, the text says, <small>BIRDS</small>, because they (like slanderers) carry their utterance, as stated (in Eccl. 10:20): <small>FOR A BIRD OF HEAVEN MAY CARRY THE UTTERANCE</small>.</p>
<p>(Lev. 14:4, cont.:) <small>CEDAR WOOD</small>. In the case of the cedar, no tree is taller (<italic>gevoha</italic>) than that one; so because &#x003C; the leper &#x003E; has exalted (<italic>gevoha</italic>) himself like a cedar, &#x003C; he has had &#x003E; the leprosy come upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn1092">27</xref></sup> Thus Simeon ben Eleazar has said: Leprosy comes on account of haughtiness, for so you find in the case of Uzziah (in II Chron. 26:16, 19): <small>BUT WHEN HE WAS STRONG, HE GREW SO ARROGANT THAT HE</small> &#x007B;<small>ACTUALLY</small>&#x007D; <small>ACTED CORRUPTLY AGAINST THE LORD</small> [<small>HIS GOD</small>] &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; <small>BUT DURING HIS ANGER WITH THE PRIESTS, LEPROSY APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD</small>. (Lev. 14:4, cont.:) <small>AND WITH HYSSOP</small>. Among the trees there is none [as short] as the hyssop. Because &#x003C; the leper &#x003E; has humbled himself, &#x003C; leprosy &#x003E; is therefore cured through the hyssop.</p>
<p>(Lev. 14:5:) <small>&#x003C; THEN THE PRIEST SHALL GIVE A COMMAND &#x003E; TO KILL ONE BIRD</small>. Why kill one and release one? It is simply that, if he has repented, you (sic) should not see &#x003C; the leprosy &#x003E; again; but if you do not repent (<italic>hozer</italic>), the leprosy shall return (<italic>hozer</italic>) upon you, just as the live bird can return. Therefore (in vs. 7): <small>AND HE SHALL SEND THE &#x003C; LIVE &#x003E; BIRD OUT &#x003C; OVER THE OPEN COUNTRY &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Lev. 14:2:) <small>&#x003C; THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER IN THE DAY OF HIS CLEANSING: &#x003E; HE SHALL BE BROUGHT UNTO THE PRIEST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE SHALL BE BROUGHT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>BW</small></italic>&#x2019;). He comes (rt.: <italic><small>BW</small>&#x2019;</italic>). Why? Because everything is far off from him, for so David says (in Ps. 38:12 [11]): <small>MY FRIENDS AND COMPANIONS</small> &#x007B;<small>ARE FAR FROM ME. THEY</small>&#x007D; <small>STAND ALOOF FROM MY AFFLICTION, AND MY KINFOLK STAND FAR OFF</small>. So also it says (in Lev. 13:46): <small>HE SHALL DWELL ALONE; HIS DWELLING SHALL BE OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 14:2): <small>HE SHALL BE BROUGHT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>BW</small></italic>&#x2019;).</p>
<title>5.9 Leviticus 14:1ff., Part IX</title>
<p>(Lev. 14:2:) <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small>. &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; speaks about Israel, when they were in Jerusalem and when Jeremiah said: Repent; but they did not repent. So what did the Holy One do? He afflicted them with leprosy, as stated (in Is. 3:17): <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) <small>THE SCALPS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION. SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) can only refer to leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:2): <small>&#x003C; WHEN ANYONE HAS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH &#x003E; A SWELLING OR A SORE</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>)&#x2026;. <sup><xref rid="fn1094">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Lev. 14:3:) <small>AND THE PRIEST SHALL LOOK</small>. This &#x003C; priest &#x003E; is Jeremiah, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 1:1): <small>ONE OF THE PRIESTS THAT WERE IN ANATHOTH</small>&#x2026;. (Lev. 14:3, cont.:) <small>AND BEHOLD, THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS HEALED IN THE LEPER</small>, when he had exiled them to Babylon. After they had gone into exile, Nebuchadnezzar said to them that they should bow down to the image, as stated (in Dan. 3:6): <small>AND WHOEVER DOES NOT FALL DOWN AND PAY HOMAGE &#x003C; SHALL IMMEDIATELY BE THROWN INTO A BURNING FIERY FURNACE &#x003E;</small>. They said to him (in vs. 18): <small>WE WILL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS &#x003C; NOR PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP &#x003E;</small>. What did he do? <small>AND</small> (according to Numb. 19:6) <small>THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE CEDAR WOOD, CRIMSON STUFF, AND HYSSOP</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1095">30</xref></sup> i.e., Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, <small>AND CAST THEM INTO THE MIDST OF THE BURNING HEIFER</small>; for &#x003C; Nebuchadnezzar &#x003E; did cast them into the fire, as stated (in Dan. 3:21): <small>AND THEY WERE CAST INTO THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE</small>. The Holy One said to them: In this world on account of sins you have been afflicted, been purified, repented, and have &#x003C; again &#x003E; been afflicted. In the world to come I am the one who will cleanse you from on high. It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE; I WILL PURIFY YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>(Lev. 14:34:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. Let our master instruct us: For how many things does leprosy come? Thus have our masters taught: The affliction comes &#x003C; upon one &#x003E; for eleven things:<sup><xref rid="fn1097">32</xref></sup> (1) For idolatry, (2) for blessing (i.e., for cursing) the name, (3) for unchastity, (4) for theft, (5) for slander, (6) for false witness, (7) upon<sup><xref rid="fn1098">33</xref></sup> the judge who perverts justice, (8) for swearing falsely, (9) upon one who enters a domain which is not his, (10) upon one who thinks false thoughts, and (11) upon one who instigates quarrels among brothers. And some also say: for the evil eye (i.e., for being miserly). [Moreover, you &#x003C; can &#x003E; expound them all &#x003C; from Scripture &#x003E;.]</p>
<ul>
<li>How is it shown &#x003C; that leprosy comes &#x003E; for idolatry? In that, when they made the calf, they were afflicted with leprosy. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:25): <small>NOW MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE RIOTOUS</small> (<italic>parua</italic>&#x2018;); and it is written concerning the leper (in Lev. 13:45): <small>HIS HEAD SHALL BE UNKEMPT</small> (<italic>parua&#x2018;</italic>).</li>
<li>And how is it shown &#x003C; that leprosy comes &#x003E; for blessing (i.e., cursing) the name? From Goliath, of whom it is stated that he said in (I Sam. 17:8): <small>CHOOSE A MAN</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ish</italic>) <small>FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Now man (&#x2018;<italic>ish</italic>) can only be the Holy One, since it is stated (in Exod. 15:3): <small>THE LORD IS A MAN</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ish</italic>) <small>OF WAR</small>. It is also written (in I Sam. 17:46) <small>THIS DAY &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; WILL DELIVER</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SGR</small></italic>) <small>YOU</small>. Now deliverance can only imply leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:5) <small>THE PRIEST SHALL ISOLATE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SGR</small></italic>) <small>HIM</small>.</li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for unchastity? Where it is written (in Is. 3:16&#x2013;17): <small>&#x003C; BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION ARE HAUGHTY, AND WALK WITH EXTENDED NECK AND ROVING EYES</small>&#x2026;; <small>THEREFORE THE LORD WILL SMITE WITH SORES</small> (<italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) <small>THE SCALPS &#x003C; OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1099">34</xref></sup> It is also written (in Lev. 14:56): <small>FOR A SWELLING AND FOR A SORE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SPH</small></italic>) <small>AND FOR A BRIGHT SPOT</small>.</li>
<li>&#x003C; How is it shown &#x003E; for theft and for swearing falsely? Where it is stated (in Zech. 5:4): <small>I HAVE SENT IT</small> (i.e., the curse of the flying scroll in vs. 1) <small>FORTH, SAYS THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>OF HOSTS</small>]; <small>AND IT SHALL COME UNTO THE HOUSE OF THE THIEF AND UNTO THE HOUSE OF THE ONE WHO SWEARS FALSELY IN MY NAME; AND IT SHALL LODGE WITHIN HIS HOUSE; AND IT SHALL CONSUME IT</small>, [<small>EVEN</small>] <small>WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>. What is a thing which consumes timbers and stones? See, it says this is leprosy, since it is written (concerning a house infested with leprosy in Lev. 14:45): <small>AND IT</small> (i.e., the plague)<sup><xref rid="fn1100">35</xref></sup> <small>SHALL BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>.</li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for slander? From Miriam [of whom it is written (in Numb. 12:10): <small>AND THERE WAS MIRIAM WITH LEPROSY LIKE THE SNOW; SO WHEN AARON TURNED UNTO MIRIAM, THERE SHE WAS, STRICKEN WITH LEPROSY</small>.] It also says (in Lev. 14:1): <small>THIS SHALL BE THE LAW OF THE LEPER</small> (<italic>hametsora</italic>&#x2018;), &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; the one who puts forth evil (<italic>hamotsi ra</italic>&#x2018;).</li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for those who bear false witness? Where Israel testified over the Holy One and said (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS, O ISRAEL</small>. They were afflicted with leprosy, since it is written (below in vs. 25): <small>NOW MOSES SAW THAT THE PEOPLE WERE RIOTOUS</small> (<italic>parua</italic>&#x2018;).<sup><xref rid="fn1101">36</xref></sup></li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for the judge who perverts justice? Where it is stated (of unjust judges in Is. 5:24): <small>AND IT SHALL BE THAT AS A TONGUE OF FIRE CONSUMES STRAW, AND AS CHAFF SINKS DOWN IN A FLAME, THEIR</small> &#x007B;<small>BLOSSOM</small>&#x007D; [<small>ROOT</small>] <small>SHALL BE LIKE THE ROT, AND THEIR</small> &#x007B;<small>ROOT</small>&#x007D; [<small>BLOSSOM</small>] <small>SHALL RISE UP LIKE THE DUST; FOR THEY HAVE REJECTED THE LAW OF THE LORD OF HOSTS AND SPURNED THE WORD OF THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL. THEIR BLOSSOM</small> (<italic><small>PRH</small></italic>) can only refer to leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:12): <small>IF THE LEPROSY SHOULD BLOSSOM OUT WIDELY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>).</li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for one who enters a domain which is not his? From Uzziah, when he entered the domain of the priesthood. It is so stated (of him in II Chron. 26:16, 19): &#x003C; &#x2026;; <small>HE SINNED AGAINST THE LORD HIS GOD AND ENTERED INTO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD TO OFFER INCENSE UPON THE ALTAR OF INCENSE</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> <small>THEN LEPROSY APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD</small>.</li>
<li>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for one who instigates quarrels among brothers? Where it is stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;, because he had taken Sarah from Abraham.</li>
</ul>
<p>And &#x003C; how is it shown &#x003E; for the evil eye (i.e., for being miserly)? R. Isaac said: When a someone&#x2019;s eye is too evil (i.e., when someone too miserly) to lend out his possessions, &#x003C; and when &#x003E; someone goes and says: Lend me your scythe, lend me your ax, or any object, and he says to him: I do not have one, what does the Holy One do to him?<sup><xref rid="fn1102">37</xref></sup> He afflicts his house with leprosy. When he comes to the priest and says to him: Something like a plague has appeared in the house belonging to me, he commands (according to Lev. 14:45): <small>LET HIM BREAK DOWN THE HOUSE WITH ITS TIMBERS AND STONES</small>. Then everybody will see his implements, when they &#x007B;bring them out and lug them&#x007D; [lug them and bring them] outside. So they publicize<sup><xref rid="fn1103">38</xref></sup> his implements, and they all say: Did he not say: I do not have a scythe; I do not have an ax? See, he does have such and such an object, but he did not want to lend it. So his eye is evil (i.e., he is miserly), [and he is exposed]. Where is it shown? Where it says so (in Job 20:28): <small>THE PRODUCE OF HIS HOUSE SHALL DEPART, POURED OUT IN THE DAY OF HIS WRATH</small>. Moreover, there are also some who say: &#x003C; Leprosy &#x003E; also &#x003C; comes &#x003E; for vulgarity. &#x003C; How is it shown? &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1104">39</xref></sup> From Naaman (in II Kings 5:1): <small>NOW NAAMAN, THE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF THE KING OF ARAM</small> [&#x2026;; <small>BUT THE MAN, THOUGH A VALIANT WARRIOR, WAS A LEPER</small>,] because he was vulgar. &#x003C; Leprosy &#x003E; also &#x003C; comes &#x003E; upon the one who says something against his colleague. Thus you find it so in the case of Moses our Master, when he said (in Exod. 4:1): <small>BUT</small> [<small>SURELY</small>] <small>THEY SHALL NOT BELIEVE ME</small>. The Holy One said to him: They are believers &#x003C; and &#x003E; children of believers: [Believers] (in Exod. 4:31): <small>AND THE PEOPLE BELIEVED</small>; the children of believers, as stated (in Gen. 15:6): <small>AND HE</small> (Abram) <small>BELIEVED IN THE LORD</small>. However, it is necessary [for you] to be afflicted in &#x007B;his&#x007D; [your] body, since the one who suspects the innocent is afflicted in his body. It is so stated (in Exod. 4:6): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID TO HIM AGAIN: PUT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1105">40</xref></sup> <small>YOUR HAND IN YOUR BOSOM</small>. [<small>SO HE PUT HIS HAND IN HIS BOSOM; AND WHEN HE WITHDREW IT, BEHOLD, IT WAS LEPROUS, &#x003C; AS WHITE &#x003E; AS SNOW</small>.] The Holy One said to Israel: Look at the difference between you and the peoples of the world. When they sin, I afflict them first in their bodies and after that in their houses, as stated (in Gen. 12:17): <small>THEN THE LORD AFFLICTED PHARAOH WITH GREAT PLAGUES, AND &#x003C; ALSO &#x003E; HIS HOUSE</small>. But if you sin, I afflict your houses first. Where is it shown? &#x007B;Where it is stated&#x007D; [From what they read on the matter] (in Lev. 14:34): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN WHICH I AM GIVING YOU FOR A POSSESSION, AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>.</p>

Could it &#x003C; mean &#x003E; to all? The text reads (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HIS MERCY IS UPON ALL HIS WORKS</small>. Similarly you say on the matter (in Ps. 84:6 [5]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHOSE STRENGTH IS IN YOU</small>. Could it &#x003C; mean &#x003E; to all? The text reads (ibid., cont.): <small>IN WHOSE HEART ARE THE HIGHWAYS</small>. These are the ones in whose hearts &#x003C; lie &#x003E; the pathways of the Law.

The text reads (ibid., cont.): <small>FOR THE REMNANT OF HIS HERITAGE</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 73:1): <small>GOD IS TRULY GOOD TO ISRAEL, TO THE PURE IN HEART</small>. It does not say: &#x201C;God is good to Israel&#x201D;; instead &#x003C; it reads &#x003E;: <small>BUT</small> (<italic>akh</italic>) <small>&#x003C; GOD &#x003E; IS GOOD &#x003C; TO ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. <small>BUT</small> (<italic>akh</italic>) &#x003C; implies &#x003E; a limitation.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">42</xref></sup> The afflictions which he brought upon them are good. &#x003C; Good &#x003E; for what? <small>FOR THE PURE IN HEART</small>, to purify &#x003C; their heart &#x003E; today for the world to come.

<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 73:4): <small>AND THEIR BODY</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>WLM</small></italic>) <small>IS SOUND</small>, in that they are as sound as the one who bears the world (&#x2018;<small><italic>WLM</italic></small>). <small>Ps.</small> 73:7:) <small>THEIR EYES STAND OUT FROM FATNESS; THEY HAVE PASSED BEYOND THE IMAGINATIONS OF THEIR HEART</small>.]</p>
<title>5.12 Leviticus 14:33ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 14:34:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &#x003C; OF CANAAN</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND WHEN I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS &#x003E;</small>. How has the land sinned, that it should be afflicted?<sup><xref rid="fn1111">46</xref></sup> It is simply that the land is afflicted for human sin, as stated (in Ps. 107:33&#x2013;34): <small>&#x003C; HE TURNS</small>&#x2026;; <small>&#x003E; A FRUITFUL LAND INTO A SALT MARSH BECAUSE OF THE EVIL OF THOSE WHO DWELL IN IT</small>. For what reason did suffering come into the world? Because of the people, so that they would look, consider, and say: Whoever sins is afflicted, and whoever does not sin is not afflicted. So why are the trees, the stones and the walls afflicted? So that their owners will look &#x003C; at them &#x003E; and repent. And so you find that when Israel sinned, the Holy One intended to exile them. The Holy One said: If I exile them at the start, they will become a shame and a disgrace to all the nations. What did he do? He brought Sennacherib the Wicked upon all the &#x003C; other &#x003E; nations and exiled them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 10:14): <small>MY HAND</small> (the hand of Sennacherib) <small>HAS FOUND THE WEALTH OF THE PEOPLES LIKE A NEST</small>. It is also written (in vs. 13): <small>AND</small> I (Sennacherib) <small>HAVE REMOVED THE BORDERS OF PEOPLES</small>. The Holy One said: When Israel sees that I have exiled the nations of the world, they will repent and fear my judgment. It is so stated (in Zeph. 3:6&#x2013;7): <small>I HAVE ROOTED OUT THE NATIONS; THEIR CORNER TOWERS ARE DESOLATE</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND I SAID: SURELY YOU WILL FEAR ME</small>&#x2026; &#x0021; When they did not repent, they immediately went into exile. Therefore the Holy One warns them and first afflicts their houses, so that they will repent. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:34): <small>AND I PUT A PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IN A HOUSE OF THE LAND YOU POSSESS</small>. For him to repent is preferable; but if not, one is afflicted in his body, as stated (in Lev. 15:2): <small>WHEN ANY MAN HAS A DISCHARGE ISSUING FROM HIS FLESH</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;Therefore, the stones are afflicted at first.&#x007D; For him to repent is preferable; but if not, his clothes are afflicted, as stated (in Lev. 13:47): <small>WHEN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY IS IN A GARMENT</small>. Then if he does not repent, he is afflicted in his body. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 13:40): <small>WHEN SOMEONE&#x2019;S HEAD BECOMES HAIRLESS &#x003C; SO THAT HE IS BALD, HE IS CLEAN &#x003E;</small>; but still with a balding of the head there is a substantial doubt whether he is unclean or clean. For him to repent is preferable, but if not, he is afflicted with boils, as stated (in Lev. 13:18): <small>AND WHEN ONE HAS BOILS ON THE SKIN OF HIS FLESH</small> [<small>AND IS HEALED</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn1112">47</xref></sup> For him to repent is preferable, but if not, he is afflicted with five scourges &#x007B;i.e., blows&#x007D;: Swelling, sore, bright spot, scab, and plague spot. And why all this? Because he did not repent.<sup><xref rid="fn1113">48</xref></sup> &#x007B;The Holy One&#x007D; [Scripture] has said (in Prov. 19:29): <small>JUDGMENTS ARE READY FOR SCOFFERS</small>; [<small>AND STRIPES FOR THE BACK OF FOOLS</small>]. The Holy One said: Before I created the human, I prepared all these things for him. &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is comparable to an evil slave who was sold. His &#x003C; new &#x003E; master went to buy him. Since he knew about him being an evil slave, he took along chains and whips so that, if he rebelled, he might subdue him with them. When he did rebel, he brought out the chains and chained him. He brought out the whips and beat him. The slave said to him: Did you not know that I was an evil slave? Why did you buy me? He said to him: Because I knew that you were an evil slave, I prepared chains and whips for you, so that if you rebelled, I might subdue you with them. Also before the Holy One, blessed be his name, created the human one, he prepared afflictions for him, because (according to Gen. 8:21) he knows <small>THAT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1114">49</xref></sup> <small>THE INSTINCT OF ONE&#x2019;S HEART IS EVIL FROM HIS YOUTH</small>. He therefore prepared all these things for him, as stated (in Prov. 19:29): <small>JUDGMENTS ARE READY FOR SCOFFERS</small>; [<small>AND STRIPES FOR THE BACK OF FOOLS</small>].</p>
<title>5.13 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD &#x003C; FOR MANY DAYS, NOT AT THE TIME OF HER IMPURITY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted for a menstruant to sleep in the same bed with her husband, when he is in his clothes and she is in her clothes, one on one side and one on the other?<sup><xref rid="fn1115">50</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: It is forbidden &#x003C; for them &#x003E; to lie down &#x003C; together &#x003E;, because one does not one put a loophole before the observant person, and certainly not before the thief. Thus the sages compare the matter to a fire in the straw; and it says (in Lev. 18:19): <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT COME NEAR A WOMEN DURING HER PERIOD OF MENSTRUAL UNCLEANNESS</small>. &#x003C; This is &#x003E; to teach you that the Holy One warns Israel about sanctification and about purity, lest they act according to the practice of star worshipers and become unclean through their wives when they are menstruating; for whoever has intercourse with his wife when she is menstruating is under sentence of being cut off, as stated (in Lev. 20:18): <small>AND IF A MAN LIES WITH A WOMAN &#x003C; WHEN SHE IS &#x003E; UNWELL</small>&#x2026;, <small>THEY BOTH SHALL BE CUT OFF &#x003C; FROM AMONG THEIR PEOPLE &#x003E;</small>. Because star worshipers do not stay away from the menstruant they are under sentence of being cut off, as stated (in Deut. 12:29): <small>WHEN THE LORD</small> [<small>GOD</small>] <small>HAS CUT OFF THE GENTILES</small>. Because all the star worshipers are children of menstruants, they like their idolatry are called an impurity, an uncleanness, an abomination, and a destruction. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 7:26): <small>DO NOT BRING AN ABOMINATION UNTO YOUR HOUSE</small>.</p>
<title>5.14 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR MANY DAYS</small>. But are there not seven days in a menstrual period?<sup><xref rid="fn1116">51</xref></sup> So why did it call them <small>MANY DAYS</small>? [Simply because she is separated from her husband, and they are days of suffering. For that reason it calls them <small>MANY DAYS</small>.] Similarly (in Exod. 2:23): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE COURSE OF THOSE MANY DAYS &#x003C; THAT THE KING OF EGYPT DIED &#x003E;</small>. It calls them <small>MANY DAYS</small>, because they were days of suffering.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">52</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.15 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD FOR MANY DAYS</small>. Those are three days. How so? The woman is unclean for seven days and becomes clean on the eighth day. If she sees blood on that day, she observes a day like the rest and becomes clean. &#x003C; If &#x003E; she sees it again on the &#x007B;eighth&#x007D; [ninth] day, she observes that day and becomes clean. [If she sees it again on the tenth day, she observes that one and is clean.] Ergo, three days which are <small>MANY DAYS</small>. However, if she sees blood on day eleven, which is the fourth day of her cleansing, she returns to her uncleanness, and observes her seven days of menstruation from the beginning; for so have the sages taught. There are eleven days between one menstrual period and another; therefore, the woman has to keep fifteen days. How does she do so? She keeps seven days of her menstrual period. Then after that she counts seven clean days and becomes clean on the eighth day. Then she performs a strict immersion after sunset, and she is lawful for her husband. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:28): <small>AND WHEN SHE IS CLEAN FROM HER DISCHARGE</small>, [<small>SHE SHALL COUNT OFF SEVEN DAYS, AND AFTER THAT SHE SHALL BE CLEAN</small>].</p>
<title>5.16 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>. Why a woman and not a man?<sup><xref rid="fn1118">53</xref></sup> Previously it applied to men and women. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 15:2): <small>WHEN ANY MAN HAS A DISCHARGE ISSUING FROM HIS FLESH</small>. R. Meir says: The man&#x2019;s uncleanness was more serious than the woman&#x2019;s uncleanness. Why? Because the uncleanness of women is a sign of children; however, that of a man is &#x003C; a sign &#x003E; of suffering. Thus it is stated (in vs. 3): <small>AND THIS SHALL BE THE UNCLEANNESS</small> &#x007B;<small>FROM</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN</small>] <small>HIS DISCHARGE, WHETHER HIS FLESH RUNS WITH HIS DISCHARGE OR WHETHER HIS FLESH IS SEALED FROM HIS DISCHARGE</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1119">54</xref></sup> &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; something which is sealed and closed. Previously the men saw blood, until Rachel arose [and said] (in Gen. 31:35): <small>FOR THE PERIOD OF WOMEN IS UPON ME</small>. Then it was given to her. Therefore (in Exod. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>.</p>
<title>5.17 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>&#x2026;. Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab.</italic> 2:6): <small>WOMEN DIE AT THE TIME OF THEIR CHILDBIRTH FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS</small>:<sup><xref rid="fn1120">55</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C; BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CAREFUL IN REGARD TO MENSTRUATION, IN REGARD TO THE</small> <italic><small>HALLAH</small></italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1121">56</xref></sup> <small>AND IN REGARD TO THE LIGHTING OF THE LAMP</small>. <small>&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn1122">57</xref></sup> Why? Because the Adversary (<italic>Satan</italic>) only makes accusations<sup><xref rid="fn1123">58</xref></sup> in time of danger. Now the three of them are from the Torah. Where is it shown about menstruation? (Lev. 15:25:) <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>. Where is it shown about the <italic>hallah</italic>? (Numb. 15:20:) <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL SET ASIDE &#x003E; THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH AS A <italic>HALLAH</italic> OFFERING</small>&#x2026;. [Where is it shown] in regard to the lighting of the &#x003C; Sabbath &#x003E; lamp? Thus have our masters taught: Where is it shown that a person is to be zealous and diligent in the lighting of the &#x003C; Sabbath &#x003E; lamp? Where it is stated (in Is. 58:13): <small>AND YOU CALL THE SABBATH A DELIGHT</small>. This refers to the lighting of the lamp. And why were &#x003C; these commandments &#x003E; transmitted to the woman?<sup><xref rid="fn1124">59</xref></sup> The Holy One said: She cut off the lamp of the world, since it is written (in Prov. 20:27): <small>THE LAMP OF GOD IS THE BREATH OF ADAM</small>. Therefore, she shall observe the commandments of the lamp. [In regard to <italic>Hallah</italic>,] the Holy One said: She defiled the <italic>hallah</italic> of the world. This was the first Adam, who was the <italic>hallah</italic> of the world; for R. Jose ben Qetsartah has said: Just as the woman moistens her dough with water and after that takes out <italic>hallah</italic>, so it was with the first Adam (in Gen. 2:6): <small>AND A MIST</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>D</small></italic>) <small>WENT UP FROM THE EARTH</small>, and after that (in vs. 7): [<small>THE LORD GOD</small>] <small>FORMED THE HUMAN</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>DM</small></italic>) <small>OUT OF DUST FROM THE GROUND &#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;.] In regard to menstruation, the Holy One said: She shed the blood of the first Adam, and she was sentenced to have her own blood shed, since it is stated (in Gen. 9:6): <small>WHOEVER SHEDS HUMAN BLOOD, &#x003C; BY A HUMAN WILL HIS BLOOD BE SHED &#x003E;</small>. She shall observe her menstrual period to atone for the blood that she shed. Ergo (in Lev. 15:25): <small>AND WHEN A WOMAN HAS HAD A DISCHARGE OF BLOOD</small>&#x2026;. Therefore, the Holy One compares the uncleanness of Israel to the uncleanness of the menstrual period, when &#x003C; a woman &#x003E; is unclean and &#x003C; then &#x003E; purified. So the Holy One is going to purify Israel, as stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5.18 Leviticus 15:25ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation: (Ezek. 36:17:) <small>THEIR WAY BEFORE ME WAS LIKE THE UNCLEANNESS OF A MENSTRUOUS WOMAN</small>, and not like the uncleanness of a corpse. With a corpse in the house, a high priest does not enter there; but in the case of a menstruous woman, a high priest enters into the house with her and sits with her on the couch,<sup><xref rid="fn1125">60</xref></sup> but on condition that it not be shaken (when they sit on it). So if Israel were compared to the impurity of death, the Divine Presence would never return upon them; however, they are compared to the menstruant, because there is cleansing for her in a <italic>mikveh</italic>, so that the priest may be with her in the house and not be afraid. Thus the Divine Presence dwells with Israel, even though they are more unclean than those who serve stars, as stated (in Lev. 16:16): <small>&#x003C; THE TENT OF MEETING &#x003E; THAT DWELLS WITH THEM IN THE MIDST OF THEIR UNCLEANNESSES</small>. Our masters have said: When Israel was in Egypt, the women did not see menstrual blood, because the fear of Egypt was upon them. And also after Israel left Egypt, they did not see menstruation in the desert, because the Divine Presence was among them. Moreover, at first the women accepted the Torah. It is so stated (in Exod. 19:3): <small>THUS SHALL YOU SAY TO THE HOUSE OF JACOB</small>. These are the women.<sup><xref rid="fn1126">61</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND DECLARE TO THE SONS OF ISRAEL</small>. These are the men. And so it says (in Cant. 6:10): <small>TERRIBLE</small><sup><xref rid="fn1127">62</xref></sup> <small>LIKE BANNERED HOSTS</small>. Now about them it is stated (in Cant. 4:12): <small>A LOCKED GARDEN</small> [<small>IS MY SISTER, MY BRIDE</small>], <small>A LOCKED FOUNTAIN</small>, [<small>A SEALED SPRING</small>]. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you were clean and have returned to uncleanness; but in the world to come I myself will cleanse [you] so that you shall not ever become unclean. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE; I WILL PURIFY YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS</small>.</p>

<title>6.1 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 16:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH OF &#x003C; AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &#x003C; HAPPENS &#x003E; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &#x003C; FALLS &#x003E; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED</small>&#x2026;. Solomon looked and foresaw the righteous and the wicked in all generations, and he saw things that would happen to the righteous and happen to the wicked.<sup><xref rid="fn1128">1</xref></sup> Then he said (in vs. 3): <small>THIS IS AN EVIL IN ALL WHICH HAPPENS UNDER THE SUN, IN THAT THE SAME LOT &#x003C; FALLS &#x003E; TO EVERYONE</small>. (Vs. 2:) <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &#x003C; HAPPENS &#x003E; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &#x003C; FALLS &#x003E; TO THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. This refers to Abraham, in that he was called righteous, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM</small> [<small>SO</small>] <small>THAT HE MAY CHARGE &#x003C; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD &#x003E;</small>, [<small>TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE</small>]. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; AND &#x003E; TO THE WICKED</small>. This refers to Nimrod, who incited all the whole world against the Holy One. The former is dead, and the latter is dead. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO THE GOOD, TO THE CLEAN</small>, [<small>AND TO THE UNCLEAN. TO THE GOOD</small>] refers to David, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 16:12): <small>&#x003C; WITH &#x003E; BEAUTIFUL EYES AND GOOD APPEARANCE TO THE UNCLEAN</small> refers to Nebuchadnezzar. The former laid the foundation of the Temple, and the latter destroyed it. The former reigned forty years, and the latter reigned forty years. (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) <small>TO THE ONE WHO SACRIFICES</small>. This refers to Solomon, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 8:63): <small>SOLOMON SACRIFICED TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND OXEN &#x003C; AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SHEEP &#x003E; AS PEACE OFFERINGS, WHICH HE SACRIFICED TO THE LORD</small>. (Eccl., 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND TO THE ONE WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE</small>. This refers to Jeroboam, who stopped Israel from going up &#x003C; to Jerusalem &#x003E; on pilgrimage, as stated (in I Kings 12:28): <small>ENOUGH OF YOUR GOING UP TO JERUSALEM</small>&#x2026;. The latter one reigned after the former one. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD</small>. This refers to Moses, of whom it is stated (in Exod. 2:2): <small>AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>. This refers to the spies (in Numb. 13&#x2013;14)), of whom it is stated (in Prov. 13:21): <small>EVIL PURSUES SINNERS</small>. Moses did not enter the land, neither did those &#x003C; spies &#x003E; enter the land. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND THE ONE WHO TAKES AN OATH</small> (without keeping it). This refers to Zedekiah, of whom it is stated (in II Chron 36:13): <small>&#x003C; AND &#x003E; HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR, WHO HAD MADE HIM TAKE AN OATH</small> [<small>BY</small>] <small>GOD</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; IS &#x003E;</small> &#x007B;<small>EVERYONE</small>&#x007D; [<small>AS THE ONE</small>] <small>WHO FEARS AN OATH</small>. This refers to Samson, of whom it is stated (in Jud. 15:12): <small>THEN SAMSON SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO</small>] <small>THEM: SWEAR TO ME</small>&#x2026;. They put out the eyes of the former, and they put out the eyes of the latter.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2): <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD</small>. This refers to the children of Aaron. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>. This refers to those who opposed Aaron, Korah and his congregation. Now they were destroyed by fire, as stated (in Numb. 16:35): <small>AND A FIRE WENT FORTH FROM THE LORD</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; Also when the children of Aaron entered to offer sacrifice, they were consumed by fire. (Lev. 10:2:) <small>SO FIRE CAME FORTH FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND CONSUMED THEM</small>. The former offered sacrifice and were consumed by fire, and the latter offered sacrifice and were consumed by fire. So Solomon laments (in Eccl. 9:2): <small>AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD, SO IT IS WITH THE SINNER</small>. When the children of Aaron were consumed by fire, he sat and complained, saying: What sin has befallen my children that this should happen to them? Immediately the Holy One appeared to Moses and said to him: Go &#x003C; and &#x003E; console him. Where is it shown? Where it is so written (in Lev. 16:2) after the death of Aaron&#x2019;s two sons. And what did he say to him? <small>SPEAK</small> (<italic><small>DBR</small></italic>) <small>UNTO YOUR BROTHER AARON</small>&#x2026;. Now speaking (rt.: <italic><small>DBR</small></italic>) can only mean consolation, even as you say (in Is. 40:2): <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: <small>DBR</small>) <small>TENDERLY TO JERUSALEM</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.2 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.] R. Abba bar Kahana opened (with Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>&#x0021; [<small>AND OF REJOICING, WHAT DOES THAT DO</small>?] How confused is the laughter of the peoples of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn1129">2</xref></sup> which they produce in their theater<sup><xref rid="fn1130">3</xref></sup> [houses] and racing arenas.<sup><xref rid="fn1131">4</xref></sup> <small>AND OF REJOICING, WHAT DOES THAT DO</small>? What enjoyment would the disciples of the sages have there?<sup><xref rid="fn1132">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>&#x0021; R. Aha said: Solomon has said: There are things over which divine justice laughs. It is written (in Deut. 17:17): <small>HE SHALL NOT MULTIPLY WIVES FOR HIMSELF</small>; but it is written (in I Kings 11:3): <small>SO HE HAD SEVEN HUNDRED ROYAL WIVES</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">6</xref></sup> It is written (in Deut. 17:16): <small>HE SHALL NOT MULTIPLY HORSES FOR HIMSELF</small>; but it is written (in I Kings 5:6): <small>NOW SOLOMON HAD FORTY THOUSAND STALLS OF HORSES</small>. It is written (in Deut. 17:17, cont.:) <small>HE SHALL NOT MULTIPLY SILVER AND GOLD FOR HIMSELF</small>; but it is written (in I Kings 10:27): <small>AND THE KING MADE SILVER &#x003C; IN JERUSALEM AS PLENTIFUL AS STONES &#x003E;</small>. However, were &#x003C; the ingots &#x003E; not stolen? R. Jose bar Hanina said: They were like stones of ten cubits and like stones of eight cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">7</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Johay said in a baraita: Even the weights which they had in the days of Solomon were of gold. (Eccl. 2:2:) <small>AND OF REJOICING, WHAT DOES THAT DO</small>? The Holy One said: What is this crown doing in your hand? Get down off your throne. Immediately an angel in the likeness of Solomon descended and sat upon his throne. Then Solomon went around among the synagogues and academies and said (in Eccl. 1:12): I, <small>KOHELETH, WAS KING</small> [<small>OVER ISRAEL IN JERUSALEM</small>]; but they said to him: King Solomon is sitting on his throne, and you are getting crazier and crazier. Then they smote him with a rod and set a bowl of grits before him.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">8</xref></sup> In that hour Solomon said (in Eccl. 2:10): <small>AND THIS WAS MY PORTION FROM ALL MY LABOR</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>&#x0021; How confused was the laughter, when divine justice laughed over the generation of the flood&#x0021; [Thus it is written] (in Job 21:10&#x2013;13): <small>THEIR BULL BREEDS &#x003C; AND DOES NOT FAIL</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">9</xref></sup> <small>THEY SEND FORTH THEIR LITTLE ONES LIKE A FLOCK, &#x003C; AND THEIR CHILDREN DANCE ABOUT &#x003E;</small>. <small>THEY</small> &#x007B;<small>TAKE UP</small>&#x007D; [<small>SING TO</small>] <small>TIMBREL AND HARP</small>&#x2026;. <small>THEY SPEND</small> [<small>THEIR DAYS</small>] <small>IN PROSPERITY</small>. When they said (in vs. 15): <small>WHAT IS THE ALMIGHTY THAT WE SHOULD SERVE HIM</small>? the Holy One said to them (in Eccl. 2:2): <small>AND OF REJOICING, WHAT DOES THAT DO</small>? By your life, I am destroying your memory from the world, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE WIPED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>&#x0021; How confused was the laughter, when Divine justice laughed over the people of Sodom&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1137">10</xref></sup> (Job 28:5&#x2013;8:) <small>AS FOR THE EARTH, OUT OF IT COMES FORTH BREAD; BUT UNDERNEATH IT IS CHANGED AS IF INTO FIRE. ITS STONES ARE THE PLACE OF SAPPHIRES</small>&#x2026;. <small>NO BIRD OF PREY KNOWS A PATH &#x003C; TO IT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>PROUD BEASTS HAVE NOT TRODDEN IT</small>&#x2026;. When they said: Let us forget the traveler in our midst, as it is written (in Job 28:4): <small>ONE BREAKS OPEN A SHAFT AWAY FROM WHERE PEOPLE DWELL; &#x003C; IN PLACES &#x003E; FORGOTTEN BY THE TRAVELER</small>&#x2026;.; the Holy One said to them: (Eccl. 2:2): <small>AND OF REJOICING, WHAT DOES THAT DO</small>? By your life, I will make you forgotten by the world. This is what is written (in Gen. 19:24&#x2013;25): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE</small>&#x2026;; <small>AND HE DESTROYED THOSE CITIES</small>&#x2026;.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:2): <small>OF LAUGHTER I SAID: IT IS MAD</small>&#x0021; R. Pinhas said: How confused was the laughter, when Divine Justice laughed over Elisheba bat Amminadab,<sup><xref rid="fn1138">11</xref></sup> when she saw four joys in one day.<sup><xref rid="fn1139">12</xref></sup> She saw her brother-in-law (Moses) a king, her husband a high priest, her brother (Naashon) a prince (<italic>nasi</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1140">13</xref></sup> and her two sons deputy high priests. When they went in to offer sacrifice, they came out destroyed by fire; and her joy turned into sorrow. [This is what is written (in Lev. 16:1): <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.]</p>
<title>6.3 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 16:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH &#x003C; OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS</small> (<italic>la-holelim</italic>): <small>DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>&#x2026;. <italic>&#x003C; La-holelim</italic> means &#x003E; &#x201C;to those who create confusion (<italic>la-ma&#x2018;arbavya</italic>&#x2019;).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1141">14</xref></sup> These are the ones whose heart is full of evil intrigues (<italic>holhaliyot</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1142">15</xref></sup> R.

(Ps. 75:5 [4], cont.:) <small>TO THE WICKED, DO NOT LIFT UP THE HORN</small>. The righteous have not been happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world? [The first Adam was not happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world?] R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon [ben Menasya]: The round of the first Adam&#x2019;s heel outshone<sup><xref rid="fn1144">17</xref></sup> the sphere of the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn1145">18</xref></sup> [And do not be surprised at this. According to universal custom, when a person makes two small plates,<sup><xref rid="fn1146">19</xref></sup> one for himself and one for his household, whose does he make the more beautiful? Is it not his own? So the first Adam was created for the service of the Holy One, but the sphere of the sun was created for the service of mortals. Is it not all the more certain that the round of the first Adam&#x2019;s heel outshone the sphere of the sun?] Now if the round of Adam&#x2019;s heel outshone &#x003C; it &#x003E;, how much the more &#x003C; must &#x003E; the countenance<sup><xref rid="fn1147">20</xref></sup> of his face &#x003C; have outshone it &#x003E;. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: The Holy One set up thirteen canopies for the first Adam in the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13): <small>YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD, EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS YOUR COVERING</small>. Then after all this glory, &#x003C; he was told &#x003E; (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. Abraham was not happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world? Abraham had a son born to him at the end of a hundred years. Then the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY SON</small>. So he journeyed, as written (in vs. 4): <small>AND ON THE THIRD DAY</small> [<small>ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES</small>] <small>AND SAW</small>. What did he see? He saw a cloud joined to the mountain. He said to his son: My son, what do you see?<sup><xref rid="fn1148">21</xref></sup> He said to him: I see a beautiful mountain with a cloud joined to it. He said to his lads: Do you see anything? They said to him: We see a mountain and a hill. He said to them (in vs. 5): <small>STAY HERE WITH</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>M</small></italic>) <small>THE DONKEY</small>, &#x003C; i.e., <small>STAY HERE, YOU &#x003E; PEOPLE</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>M</small></italic>) <small>WHO ARE LIKE THE DONKEY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1149">22</xref></sup> He took his son Isaac and went up to the top of the mountain. Then he built the altar, arranged the wood, bound him upon the altar, and took the knife. If the Angel had not said to him (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT RAISE</small> [<small>YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>], he would have already been slaughtered. When he came to his mother, she said to him: What did your father do to you. He told her: Daddy took me, brought me up mountains, brought me down valleys, brought me up to the top of a particular mountain, and built an altar. So he told the whole story. If the Angel had not said to him (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE</small> [<small>YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>], I would have already been slaughtered. She said to him: Woe (<italic>vay</italic>) to you, &#x003C; my &#x003E; poor son&#x0021; If &#x003C; the angel &#x003E; had not said to him (in vs. 12): <small>DO NOT RAISE &#x003C; YOUR HAND &#x003E;</small>, you would have already been slaughtered&#x0021; She did not succeed in finishing the sentence before her breath departed from her. It is so stated (in Gen. 23:2): <small>AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER</small>. From where had he &#x003C; just &#x003E; come? He had &#x003C; just &#x003E; come from Mount Moriah.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, as it were, was not happy in his world, so should the children of Adam seek to be happy in his world? &#x201C;The Lord was happy in his works&#x201D; is not written here (in Ps. 104:31), but <small>LET</small> [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>BE HAPPY</small> [<small>IN HIS WORKS</small>]. And when will he rejoice in the works of the righteous? In the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Israel was not happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy? &#x201C;Israel was happy in its maker&#x201D; is not written here (in Ps. 149:2), but <small>LET ISRAEL</small> [<small>BE HAPPY IN ITS MAKER</small>], because it is in the future that they are going to be happy in the Holy One. It is therefore written (in Ps. 75:5 [4]): <small>I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS: DO NOT MAKE MERRY</small>.</p>
<title>6.4 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.] R. Judan of Gallia opened (with Job 39:27): <small>IS IT AT YOUR COMMAND THAT THE EAGLE MOUNTS UP AND MAKES ITS NEST ON HIGH</small>? The Holy One said to Aaron: At your command [I had my Divine Presence rest upon the Ark.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">25</xref></sup> Was it not at your command that I] removed my Divine Presence that was upon the Ark? In the case of the first temple (according to Job 39:28): <small>IT DWELLS AND LODGES ON THE ROCK</small>, &#x003C; i.e., the Divine Presence was there for &#x003E; a lodging of one night. In the case of the second temple (referred to in ibid., cont.): <small>ON A ROCKY CRAG</small><sup><xref rid="fn1153">26</xref></sup> <small>AND A STRONGHOLD</small>, &#x003C; i.e., the Divine Presence was there for &#x003E; a lodging of many nights.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">27</xref></sup> Moreover, we learn there (in <italic>Yoma</italic> 5:2): <small>WHEN THE ARK HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY, THERE WAS A CERTAIN STONE THERE FROM THE DAYS OF THE FORMER PROPHETS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">28</xref></sup> <small>AND IT WAS NAMED FOUNDATION</small>. And why was it named Foundation? Because out of it the world was founded.<sup><xref rid="fn1156">29</xref></sup> And how would a high-priest pray on the Day of Atonement?<sup><xref rid="fn1157">30</xref></sup> May it be your will, O Lord our God, that this year be one of rain, warmth, and dew, a year of low prices, a year of abundance, a year of grace, a year of blessing, a year of trade, a year when your people Israel are not dependent on each other, a year when [&#x003C; the people of &#x003E; Israel] will not be arrogant with each other. Now The Rabbis of Caesarea said: &#x003C; It was &#x003E; with reference to our brothers in Caesarea &#x003C; that the high priest prayed &#x003E; for them not to be arrogant with each other. But &#x007B;our Rabbi&#x007D; but [the Rabbis of the South] say: &#x003C; It was &#x003E; with reference to our brothers in the South,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">31</xref></sup> lest their houses become their tombs.<sup><xref rid="fn1159">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Job 39:29:) <small>FROM THERE IT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1160">33</xref></sup> <small>SPIES OUT FOOD</small>; &#x007B;<small>AND ITS EYES BEHOLD IT FROM AFAR</small>&#x007D;. From there it searches and spies out food for all of the whole year. (Ibid.:) <small>AND ITS EYES BEHOLD IT FROM AFAR</small>. He (i.e., the high priest) knew from beginning to end &#x003C; what would happen during the year &#x003E;. How so? When he looked and saw smoke from the pile (of wood on the Temple altar)<sup><xref rid="fn1161">34</xref></sup> rising southward, it knew that one would have enough in the South. And it was the same for the North, the same for the West, and the same for the East. &#x003C; When the smoke rose straight up &#x003E; towards the sky, it knew that the whole world would have enough. [Then after all this advantage, (according to Job 39:30:) <small>ITS NESTLINGS SUCK</small> (from &#x2018;<italic>L</italic>&#x2018;) <small>UP BLOOD</small>&#x2026;.&#x003C; Aaron &#x003E; saw his nestlings wallowing (from <italic>G&#x2018;G</italic>&#x2018;) in blood and (according to Lev. 10:3) kept silent. However (ibid., cont.), <small>WHERE THE SLAIN ARE</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; Nadab and Abihu, <small>THERE IT IS</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; there is the Divine Presence.] R. Judan said in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi, &#x003C; who spoke &#x003E; in the name of R. Berekhyah, &#x003C; who spoke &#x003E; in the name of R. Hiyya bar Abba:<sup><xref rid="fn1162">35</xref></sup> (Lev. 10:4:) <small>DRAW NEAR AND CARRY YOUR BROTHERS AWAY &#x003C; FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP &#x003E;</small>. &#x201C;From the sanctuary&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY</small>. &#x003C; The situation is &#x003E; similar to someone who says to his colleague: Remove the dead person from before his father. How long shall he look at his dead child. It is therefore written (in Exod. 16:1): <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.</p>
<title>6.5 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>[(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.] &#x007B;R. Isaac&#x007D; [R. Ahawa] bar Ze&#x2018;era said: (Job 37:1:) <small>AT THIS ALSO MY HEART TREMBLES AND LEAPS FROM ITS PLACE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND LEAPS</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1163">36</xref></sup> &#x201C;Jumps,&#x201D; as &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; says (in Lev. 11:21): <small>&#x003C; WHICH HAVE KNEES ABOVE THEIR FEET &#x003E; WITH WHICH TO JUMP UPON THE EARTH</small>. Moreover, we translate &#x003C; the word &#x003E; &#x003E; &#x201C;to jump&#x201D; (in the Targum Onqelos of Lev. 11:21). When Titus the Wicked entered the Holy of Holies and &#x007B;sawed&#x007D; [cut] &#x003C; open &#x003E; the curtain,<sup><xref rid="fn1164">37</xref></sup> he entered in peace and came out in peace; but the sons of Aaron entered to offer sacrifice and came out destroyed by fire. [It is so stated (in Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.</p>
<p>(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF &#x003C; AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>. R. Berekhyah opened (with Prov. 17:26): <small>TO PUNISH ALSO THE RIGHTEOUS IS NOT GOOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">38</xref></sup> Although the Holy One punished Aaron (for the golden calf) by taking his two children from him, it <small>IS NOT GOOD</small>. It was only (according to ibid., cont.) <small>TO SMITE THE NOBLE ONES FOR UPRIGHTNESS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">39</xref></sup> This is what is written (in Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF &#x003C; AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>6.6 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF &#x003C; AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>. &#x007B;R. Eliezer cited a baraita:&#x007D; [According to a baraita in the name of R. Eliezer,]<sup><xref rid="fn1167">40</xref></sup> Nadab and Abihu died only because they had taught halakhah in the presence of their master, Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn1168">41</xref></sup> There is a story about Rabbi Eliezer, that his disciple taught halakhah before him. So he said to his wife, Mamma Shalom: This man will not live out the year; and indeed he did not live out the year. His disciples said to him: O Our Master, are you a prophet? He said to them (in the words of Amos 7:14): <small>I AM NEITHER A PROPHET NOR THE SON OF A PROPHET</small>. Rather this was handed down to me from my masters: Whoever teaches halakhah in the presence of his master is under sentence of death.</p>
<p>According to a baraita a disciple is forbidden to teach halakhah in the presence of his master until he is twelve miles<sup><xref rid="fn1169">42</xref></sup> away from him, &#x003C; a distance &#x003E; corresponding to the &#x003C; extent of &#x003E; the camp of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">43</xref></sup> [This is what is written (in Numb. 33:49): <small>THEY ENCAMPED BY THE JORDAN FROM BETH-JESHIMOTH AS FAR AS ABEL-SHITTIM</small>.] R. Nahum bar Jeremiah was in Hefer. They would ask him, and he would teach. They would ask him, and he would teach. They said to him: Rabbi, have we not learned thus: A student is forbidden to teach halakhah in the presence of his master until he is twelve miles away from him, &#x003C; a distance &#x003E; corresponding to the camp of Israel? And does [our master], R. Mani, dwell in Sepphoris? He said to them: Surely if I had known &#x003C; of his presence &#x003E;, I should not have taught. From that time on he did not teach.</p>
<title>6.7 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>In four places where &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentions the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons,<sup><xref rid="fn1171">44</xref></sup> [it also mentions their transgression. And why all this?<sup><xref rid="fn1172">45</xref></sup> To inform you that they had only this sin on their hands. R. Eleazar of Modim said: Go out and see how grievous the death of Aaron&#x2019;s sons was for the Holy One, for in every place that &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; mentions their death, it mentions their transgression. And why all this? So as not to give those who come into the world a pretext for saying: Disgraceful acts were secretly &#x003C; reckoned &#x003E; to their &#x003C; account &#x003E;, because of which they died.</p>
<p>Bar Qappara said in the name of R. Jeremiah bar Eleazar: Aaron&#x2019;s sons died because of four things:] for the drawing near, for the sacrificing, for alien fire, and for not taking advice from each other.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">46</xref></sup> For drawing near, in that they entered the innermost sanctuary. For the sacrificing, in that they offered a sacrifice, which they had not been commanded &#x003C; to offer &#x003E;. For alien fire, in that they had brought fire from a cookhouse (instead of from off the altar). And for not taking advice from each other.</p>
<p>R. Mani of Sha&#x2019;av and R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Aaron&#x2019;s sons died because of four things, and &#x003C; a sentence of &#x003E; death is recorded in connection with all of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">47</xref></sup> Because they entered and had drunk wine, and it says (in Lev. 10:9): <small>DRINK NO WINE OR INTOXICATING LIQUOR</small>&#x2026;, <small>LEST YOU DIE</small>. Because they entered without washing hands and feet, and it says (in Exod. 30:20): <small>WHEN THEY COME UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING, THEY SHALL WASH WITH WATER LEST THEY DIE</small>. Because they entered while lacking &#x003C; the proper &#x003E; clothes. And what did they lack? R. Levi said: They were lacking a robe, and &#x003C; a sentence of &#x003E; death is recorded in connection with &#x003C; that lack &#x003E;, where it is stated (in Exod. 28:35): <small>AND IT</small> (the robe with golden bells and pomegranates) <small>SHALL BE UPON AARON FOR OFFICIATING, SO THAT THE SOUND OF IT SHALL BE HEARD, &#x003C; WHEN HE COMES INTO THE SANCTUARY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;, [<small>LEST HE DIE</small>]. And because they had no children, and &#x003C; a sentence of &#x003E; death is recorded in connection with &#x003C; that lack &#x003E;, where it is stated (in Numb. 3:4): <small>BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED</small>&#x2026;; <small>AND THEY HAD NO CHILDREN</small>. Abba Hanan says: Because they had no wives, and it is recorded (in Lev. 16:6): <small>AND HE SHALL MAKE ATONEMENT FOR HIMSELF AND FOR HIS HOUSEHOLD</small>. R. Levi said: They had a lot of arrogance and were saying: Which woman is worthy of us?<sup><xref rid="fn1175">48</xref></sup> A lot of women were remaining unmarried and waiting for them. But they were saying: Our father is high priest, our father&#x2019;s brother is prince, &#x003C; and &#x003E; we are deputy high priests. Which woman is worthy of us? R. Menahama [said] in the name of R. Joshua bar Hanina: &#x003C; It is &#x003E; about them &#x003C; that &#x003E; it says (in Ps. 78:63): <small>FIRE DEVOURED THEIR YOUNG MEN, AND THEIR MAIDENS HAD NO NUPTIAL SONG</small>. Why had <small>FIRE DEVOURED THEIR YOUNG MEN</small>? Because of <small>THEIR MAIDENS</small>, who <small>HAD NO NUPTIAL SONG</small>. And moreover, &#x003C; their arrogance may be inferred &#x003E; from this (i.e., from Exod. 24:1): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO MOSES: GO UP UNTO THE LORD, YOU AND AARON, NADAB AND ABIHU, &#x003C; AND THE SEVENTY ELDERS OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. This teaches that Moses and Aaron walked first, while Nadab and Abihu came after them; but still they were saying: These two old men shall die, and we shall assume authority over the community in their place.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">49</xref></sup> &#x007B;R. Ayyevu said:&#x007D; [R. Judan said in the name of R. Ayyevu:] They said it to each other with their mouths, &#x003C; while &#x003E; R. Pinhas said: they pondered it in their hearts. R. Berekhyah said: The Holy One said to them (in Prov. 27:1): <small>DO NOT BOAST OF TOMORROW</small>&#x2026;. A lot of colts have died, and their skins have been made into coverings for their mother&#x2019;s backs. And in addition &#x003C; their arrogance may be inferred &#x003E; from this (i.e., from Exod. 24:11): <small>BUT HE</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>STILL DID NOT RAISE HIS HAND AGAINST THE NOBLES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. From here &#x003C; it follows &#x003E; that they deserved to have a hand raised &#x003C; against them &#x003E;. R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said: Did <italic>cellaria</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1177">50</xref></sup> (i.e., provisions) go up with them to Sinai, since it says (ibid., cont.): <small>THEY BEHELD GOD, &#x003C; AND THEY ATE AND DRANK &#x003E;</small>. It is simply that they feasted their eyes on the Divine Presence. &#x003C; They were &#x003E; like someone who beholds his colleague in the midst of eating and drinking. R. Johanan said: &#x003C; There was &#x003E; actual eating [and drinking], since it is written (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING&#x2019;S FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>. R. Tanhuma said: &#x003C; Exod. 24:11 &#x003E; teaches that they became bold in their hearts and stood on their feet, &#x003C; while &#x003E; they feasted their eyes on the Divine Presence. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Moses did not feast his eyes on the Divine Presence, as stated (in Exod. 3:6): <small>MOSES HID HIS FACE</small>&#x2026;. And in addition, &#x003C; the boldness of Aaron&#x2019;s sons may be inferred &#x003E; from this (i.e., from Numb. 3:4): <small>BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Was it <small>BEFORE THE LORD</small> that they died? &#x003C; The verse &#x003E; simply teaches that it is grievous for the Omnipresent when children of righteous people pass away during their &#x003C; parents&#x2019; &#x003E; lifetime.</p>
<title>6.8 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>R. Nahman of Joppa said in the name of R. Pinhas &#x003C; who spoke &#x003E; in the name of R. &#x2260; Simon: (Numb. 3:40 <small>&#x003C; BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED &#x003E; BEFORE THE LORD, &#x003C; WHEN THEY OFFERED ALIEN FIRE &#x003E; BEFORE THE LORD &#x003C; IN THE SINAI DESERT &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; SO ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR SERVED AS PRIESTS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR FATHER AARON &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; <small>BEFORE THE LORD</small> occurs &#x003E; two times. <small>&#x003C; IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR FATHER AARON</small> occurs &#x003E; one time. It is simply that it was twice as grievous for the Holy One as for their father.</p>
<p>(Ibid.:) <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. [R. Meir said:] Did they die <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>? It is simply that from Mount Sinai they received their sentence of death.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">51</xref></sup> &#x003C; The situation is comparable &#x003E; to a king who was marrying off his daughter, when there was found something obscene in his bridal agent.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">52</xref></sup> The king said: If I kill him &#x003C; now &#x003E;, I shall impede my daughter&#x2019;s joy. Some day soon my joy is coming. It is better &#x003C; to kill him &#x003E; during my own joyous celebration, and not during my daughter&#x2019;s joyous celebration. Similarly the Holy One said: If I kill Nadab and Abihu now, I shall impede the joyous celebration of the Torah. Some day soon my own joyous celebration is coming. It is better &#x003C; to kill them &#x003E; during my own joyous celebration, and not during the joyous celebration of the Torah. This is what is written (in Cant. 3:11): <small>ON HIS WEDDING DAY</small>, i.e., the day of the giving of Torah, <small>IN THE DAY OF HIS JOYFUL HEART</small>, i.e., in the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<title>6.9 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 3:4:) <small>AND THEY HAD NO CHILDREN</small>. R. Jacob bar Abbayi said in the name of R. Aha: If they had had children, they would have taken precedence over Eleazar and Ithamar, since whoever takes precedence &#x007B;in dignity&#x007D; [with respect to inheritance] takes precedence with respect to honor, provided that he follows the behavior of his forebears.<sup><xref rid="fn1180">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid.:) <small>SO ELEAZAR AND ITHAMAR SERVED AS PRIESTS IN THE PRESENCE OF</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al-pene</italic>) <small>THEIR FATHER AARON</small>. R. Isaac said: During his lifetime; but R. Hiyya bar Abba said: At his death. According to the opinion of Rabbi Isaac, who said: During his lifetime, &#x2018;<italic>al-pene</italic> is mentioned here, and pene is also mentioned elsewhere (in Gen. 11:28): <small>AND HARAN DIED IN THE LIFETIME OF</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al-pene</italic>) <small>HIS FATHER TERAH</small>. If <italic>pene</italic> as used elsewhere (i.e., in Gen. 11:28) &#x003C; means &#x003E; &#x201C;during his lifetime,&#x201D; <italic>pene</italic> as used here (in Numb. 3:4) also &#x003C; means &#x003E; &#x201C;during his lifetime.&#x201D; According to the opinion of R. Hiyya bar Abba, who said: At his death, <italic>pene</italic> is used here (in Numb. 3:4) and <italic>pene</italic> is used elsewhere (in Gen. 23:3): <small>THEN ABRAHAM AROSE FROM BESIDE</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al-pene</italic>) <small>HIS DEAD</small> (i.e., his dead wife). If <italic>pene</italic> as used elsewhere (in Gen. 23:3) &#x003C; means &#x003E; &#x201C;at his death,&#x201D; <italic>pene</italic> as used here (in Numb. 3:4) also &#x003C; means &#x003E; &#x201C;at his death.&#x201D; Now according to the opinion of R. Isaac, who said: During his lifetime: If uncleanness befell Aaron, Eleazar ministered; if uncleanness befell Eleazar, Ithamar ministered. There is a story about Simeon ben Qimhit,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">54</xref></sup> that he went out to speak with the king of the Arabians.<sup><xref rid="fn1182">55</xref></sup> When a streak of saliva squirted from &#x003C; the king&#x2019;s &#x003E; mouth onto his clothes and rendered him unclean, his brother Judah entered and ministered in the high priesthood in his place. That day Qimhit saw two of her sons as high priests. They said: Qimhit had seven sons, and all of them ministered in the high priesthood. The sages entered her home and said to her: Tell us what good deeds you have to your credit? She said to them: By the temple service, the rafters of my house have never seen the hair of my head. They say: All flours (<italic>qimhayya</italic>) are flour (<italic>qimhin</italic>), but the flour of Qimhit is fine flour. In reference to her they read this verse. (Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING&#x2019;S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>; [<small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>].</p>
<p>Now according to the opinion of R. Hiyya bar Abba, who said: At his death, when Aaron died, Eleazar ministered; when Eleazar died, Ithamar served in his place.</p>
<title>6.10 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part X</title>
<p>R. Abba bar Abbina said: For what reason is the parashah on &#x003C; the death of &#x003E; Miriam (Numb. 20:1) near the parashah on the ashes of the &#x003C; red &#x003E; heifer (Numb. 19:1ff.)?<sup><xref rid="fn1183">56</xref></sup> Simply to teach that just as the ashes of the &#x003C; red &#x003E; heifer atones, so does the death of the righteous atone. R. [Judan] said: For what reason is the death of Aaron (Deut. 10:6) near the breaking of the tablets (Deut. 9:17)? To teach that the death of the righteous is as grievous to the Holy One as the breaking of the tablets. R. Hiyya bar Abba said: The sons of Aaron died on the first of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">57</xref></sup> Why does it mention their death on the Day of Atonement (in Lev. 16:1)? &#x007B;He said to him:&#x007D; [It is simply] to teach that, just as the Day of Atonement atones, so does the death of the righteous atone. And where is it shown that the Day of Atonement atones? Where it is stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU TO CLEANSE YOU</small>. And where it is shown that the death of the righteous atones? Where it is stated (in II Sam. 21:14): <small>THEN THEY BURIED THE BONES OF SAUL</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND GOD RESPONDED TO THE PLEA OF THE LAND THEREAFTER</small>.</p>
<title>6.11 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part XI</title>
<p>(Lev. 16:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH &#x003C; OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Job 37:1): <small>AT THIS ALSO MY HEART TREMBLES</small>. [Who spoke this verse? Elihu spoke it.] Elihu was observing how the sons of Aaron went in to sacrifice and came out destroyed by fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1185">58</xref></sup> He was amazed and said (ibid.): <small>AT THIS ALSO MY HEART TREMBLES AND LEAPS FROM ITS PLACE</small>. What did he see for him to say this? It is simply at a time when<sup><xref rid="fn1186">59</xref></sup> the priesthood was shaken &#x007B;i.e., when &#x003C; the priesthood &#x003E; had become weak&#x007D; in the hand of Aaron. What is written there (in Numb. 17:21 [6])? <small>THEN MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL; AND THEIR PRINCES GAVE HIM A STAFF, A STAFF FOR EACH PRINCE</small>&#x2026;. So he wrote the name of each and every tribe on its staff. He also wrote the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi and put it in the middle. Moses said &#x003C; It was &#x003E; lest the children of Israel say: It smelled the Divine Presence and bore fruit. [Moses said: See, I am putting it in the middle so as not to give a pretext, as stated (in Numb. 17:21 [6], cont.): <small>AND THE STAFF OF AARON WAS IN THE MIDST OF THEIR STAFFS</small>.] What is written there (in vs. 22&#x2013;23 [7&#x2013;8])? <small>THEN MOSES PLACED THE STAFFS &#x003C; BEFORE THE LORD IN THE TENT OF THE TESTIMONY &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND THERE THE STAFF OF AARON &#x003C; OF THE HOUSE OF LEVI &#x003E; HAD SPROUTED; IT &#x003C; HAD PUT FORTH SPROUTS, PRODUCED BLOSSOMS, &#x003E; AND HAD BORNE ALMONDS</small>. The scriptural text lacked nothing. Why then: <small>AND HAD BORN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>GML</small></italic>) <small>ALMONDS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShQD</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn1187">60</xref></sup> It repaid (rt.: <italic><small>GML</small></italic>) anyone who was bent on (rt.: <italic><small>ShQD</small></italic>) evil against the tribe of Levi. So while (in Numb. 17:16&#x2013;24 [1&#x2013;9]) even dry pieces of wood emitted an aroma among those who live in the world, [sprouted blossoms,] came out alive, and produced fruits; the sons of Aaron, who entered there alive, came out destroyed by fire. So when Elihu beheld the one and the other, he said (in Job 37:1): <small>AT THIS ALSO MY HEART TREMBLES</small>. When? (Lev. 16:1:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.</p>

<p>[(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.] &#x003C; All &#x003E; four of [Aaron&#x2019;s sons] deserved to die; but Moses prayed for them, and his prayer produced half &#x003C; an answer &#x003E;.

When Israel made the calf, what is written there (in Deut. 9:20)? <small>AND THE LORD WAS ANGRY ENOUGH WITH AARON TO DESTROY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShMD</small></italic>) <small>HIM</small>. Destruction (rt.: <italic><small>ShMD</small></italic>) can only be annihilation.

When Moses prayed, his prayer produced half &#x003C; an answer &#x003E;.</p>
<p>[(Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.] The Holy One said to him: Aaron, did I not write this in my Torah (in Exod. 22:8 [9]): <small>IN EVERY CASE OF MISAPPROPRIATION, WHETHER FOR A BULL</small>&#x2026;. Do you not remember what you did with the bull, as stated (in Ps. 106:20): <small>THUS THEY EXCHANGED THEIR GLORY FOR THE IMAGE OF A BULL</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1188">61</xref></sup> (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>FOR AN ASS</small>.

(Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>FOR A GARMENT</small>. &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; that one about which it is written (in Is. 3:6): <small>YOU HAVE A GARMENT; YOU SHALL BE OUR LEADER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1191">64</xref></sup> (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>&#x003C; OR &#x003E; ANY LOSS</small>, since it is written of them (i.e., of Israel in Jer. 50:6): <small>MY PEOPLE WERE LOST SHEEP</small>. (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>OF WHICH ONE SAYS: THIS IS IT</small>. &#x003C; This refers to &#x003E; them when they said (in Exod. 32:8): &#x007B;<small>THIS IS YOUR GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>THESE ARE YOUR GODS</small>], <small>O ISRAEL</small>. (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>THE CASE OF BOTH PARTIES SHALL COME BEFORE GOD</small>. This refers to Moses of whom it is written (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE, I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>, &#x003C; in that &#x003E; Moses sat in judgment over them. (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>THE ONE WHOM GOD CONDEMNS</small>. This refers to the judges, of whom it is written (in Exod. 22:27 [28]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT CURSE A GOD &#x003C; NOR A RULER OF YOUR PEOPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">65</xref></sup> (Exod. 22:8 [9], cont.:) <small>SHALL PAY HIS NEIGHBOR DOUBLE</small>.

<title>6.13 Leviticus 16:1ff., Part XIII</title>
<p>[From where did the sin come, for which they received [their &#x003C; repayment &#x003E;?]<sup><xref rid="fn1193">66</xref></sup> R. Hosha&#x2019;ya said: When Moses along with the elders of Israel went up from the desert; Aaron, Hur, seventy elders, Nadab, and Abihu went up with him.<sup><xref rid="fn1194">67</xref></sup> Moses and Aaron walked first, Nadab and Abihu walked after them, and all the elders of Israel walked after them. Now Nadab and Abihu reflected in their hearts and said: When will these two elders pass away so that we may receive authority and become first in everything: The Holy One said to them (in Prov. 27:1): <small>DO NOT BOAST OF TOMORROW</small>. A lot of colts have died, and their skins have been made into coverings for their mother&#x2019;s backs. He said to them: From that time you should have gotten your &#x003C; just deserts &#x003E;, but what shall I do? See, I shall wait for you until the Tabernacle goes up, and after that I shall judge them. Therefore, when the Tabernacle was standing they received their sentence <sup><xref rid="fn1195">68</xref></sup> and died. (Lev. 16:1:) <small>AFTER THE DEATH OF AARON&#x2019;S TWO SONS</small>.</p>
<p>R. Aha said: From where did they receive their &#x003C; just deserts &#x003E;? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; simply that they were not coming together for being fruitful and multiplying.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">69</xref></sup> They were saying: We are apprentices for the high priesthood; so should we take wives who are not worthy of us? R. Aha said (in the words of Ps. 78:63): <small>FIRE DEVOURED THEIR YOUNG MEN</small>. Why? Because (ibid., cont.) <small>THEIR MAIDENS HAD NO NUPTIAL SONG</small>.</p>
<p>Our masters say: &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because their eyes strayed away from the Divine Presence. They (i.e., Nadab and Abihu) said: Moses did not do so, when (according to Exod. 24:9&#x2013;10) he went into the firmament and beheld the Divine Presence; for he had no need of either eating or drinking. With us also, when we behold the Divine Presence, we shall have no need of either eating or drinking. Even so, (according to vs. 11): <small>THEY BEHELD GOD</small>, but they did need to eat and drink, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THEY ATE AND DRANK</small>. From that time the Holy One sought to stretch out his hand against them. The Holy One said: I shall wait until the Tabernacle is made. Then when they enter to sacrifice (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>), I shall carry out the divine judgment upon them. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 16:1, cont.): <small>WHEN THEY DREW NEAR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) <small>BEFORE THE LORD, THEY DIED. BEFORE THE LORD</small> is written two times (in Numb. 3:4): <small>BUT NADAB AND ABIHU DIED BEFORE THE LORD, WHEN THEY OFFERED ALIEN FIRE</small> [<small>BEFORE THE LORD</small>]. Why two times? The Holy One said: Bring out the dead from before me, for so it is written (in Lev. 10:4): <small>DRAW NEAR AND CARRY YOUR BROTHERS AWAY FROM BEFORE THE SANCTUARY</small>. When Israel, as it were, is in trouble, he also is with them; for so it is written (in Is. 63:9): <small>IN ALL THEIR TROUBLE, IT TROUBLED HIM</small>. R. Meir said (concerning Exod. 14:30): <small>SO THE LORD SAVED</small> (<italic><small>WYWSh</small></italic>&#x2018;, voweled as <italic>wayyosha</italic>&#x2018;) <small>&#x003C; ISRAEL &#x003E; ON THAT DAY</small>: The written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) &#x003C; reads &#x003E; <small>SO &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; WAS SAVED</small> (<italic><small>WYWSh</small></italic>&#x2018;, voweled <italic>wayyiwwasha</italic>&#x2018;) <small>&#x003C; ON THAT DAY WITH ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1197">70</xref></sup> R.

To you and to us belongs the redemption. The Holy One said: In the world to come I will redeem you. Then you shall be happy, and I will be happy. [It is so stated] (in Ps. 104:31): <small>MAY THE LORD BE HAPPY IN HIS WORKS</small>. (Ps. 149:2:) <small>LET</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; [<small>ISRAEL</small>] <small>BE HAPPY IN ITS MAKER</small>.]</p>
<title>6.14 Leviticus 17:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 17:1 &#x0026; 3:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING</small>&#x2026;. <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB, OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP</small>. The Holy Spirit proclaims (in Mal. 1:11): <small>FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING</small> [<small>MY NAME SHALL BE GREAT AMONG THE GENTILES AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE IS OFFERED TO MY NAME, EVEN A PURE OBLATION</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn1199">72</xref></sup> From the time that the sun rises until it sets, the praise<sup><xref rid="fn1200">73</xref></sup> of the Holy One never ceases from its mouth, as stated (in Ps. 113:3): <small>FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN TO ITS SETTING, THE NAME OF THE LORD IS PRAISED</small>. And you find it so when Joshua waged war with Gibeon. What is written there (in Josh. 10:12)? <small>THEN JOSHUA SPOKE TO THE LORD</small>&#x2026;: <small>O SUN, BE QUIET</small> (<italic>dom</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1201">74</xref></sup> <small>AT GIBEON</small>. &#x003C; When &#x003E; Joshua wanted to silence the sun, he did not say to it: &#x201C;O Sun, stand still (&#x2018;<italic>amod</italic>) at Gibeon,&#x201D; but <small>BE QUIET</small> (<italic>dom</italic>). Why did he say; <small>BE QUIET</small>? Because every hour that it is traveling, it is praising the Holy One; and as long as it praises &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E;, it has the power to travel &#x003C; its course &#x003E;. Joshua therefore told it to be silent, as stated (ibid.): <small>O SUN, BE QUIET AT GIBEON</small>. The sun said to Joshua: Is someone younger saying, <small>BE QUIET</small>, to someone older? I was created on the fourth &#x003C; day &#x003E;, while human beings were created on the sixth; so are you saying, <small>BE QUIET</small>, to me? Joshua said to &#x003C; the sun &#x003E;: When a young free person has an elderly slave, does he not say to him: Be silent? In the case of our father Abraham, the Holy One delivered (rt.: <italic><small>PNH</small></italic>) heaven and earth to him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19): <small>THEN HE BLESSED HIM, AND SAID: BLESSED BE ABRAM OF GOD MOST HIGH, ACQUIRER</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PNH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1202">75</xref></sup> <small>OF HEAVEN AND EARTH</small>. And not only that, but you bowed down to Joseph, as stated (in Gen. 37:9): <small>HERE WERE THE SUN, THE MOON, AND ELEVEN STARS BOWING DOWN TO ME</small>. [So would you speak against me?] Ergo (in Josh. 10:12): <small>O SUN, BE QUIET AT GIBEON</small>. The sun said to Joshua: And so are you decreeing over me that I am to be quiet? He said to it: Yes. It said to him: Then who will speak the praise of the Holy One? You be quiet, and I will speak the praise of the Holy One, as stated (in Josh. 10:12): <small>THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>) <small>JOSHUA SPOKE TO THE LORD</small>. Now <italic>az</italic> can only be a hymn, since it is stated (in Exod. 15:1): <small>MOSES SANG THEN</small> (<italic>az</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1203">76</xref></sup> (Mal. 1:11): <small>AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE IS OFFERED TO MY NAME, &#x003C; EVEN A PURE OBLATION &#x003E;</small>. R. Ammi asked R. Samuel bar Nahman: Is it correct that <small>IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE IS OFFERED TO MY NAME</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1204">77</xref></sup> The Torah warns (in Deut. 12:13&#x2013;14): <small>TAKE HEED THAT YOU DO NOT OFFER UP YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS IN ANY PLACE THAT YOU SEE, BUT ONLY IN THE PLACE THAT &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; WILL CHOOSE</small>&#x2026;. So also it says (in Lev. 17:3&#x2013;4): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB, OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND DOES NOT BRING IT UNTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C; BLOODGUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED TO THAT PERSON &#x003E;</small>. But &#x003C; there seems to be a contradiction when &#x003E; the prophet says (in Mal. 1:11): <small>AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE</small> (<italic>muqtar</italic>) <small>IS OFFERED TO MY NAME, &#x003C; EVEN A PURE OBLATION &#x003E;</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman said to him (i.e., to R.

[It also says] (in I Kings 18:36): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING OF THE OBLATION</small> (<italic>minhah</italic>), <small>&#x003C; THE PROPHET &#x003E; ELIJAH DREW NEAR &#x003C; AND SAID &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">79</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.15 Leviticus 17:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 17:3): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 51:20&#x2013;21 [18&#x2013;19]): <small>MAKE ZION PROSPER IN YOUR GOOD PLEASURE; REBUILD THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM. THEN YOU SHALL DELIGHT IN SACRIFICES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, BURNT OFFERINGS, AND WHOLE OFFERINGS</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">80</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a rich and noble bachelor, who has no wife. His house was not &#x003C; really &#x003E; a house. Why? When the tenants came, he said to them: Go to the store. Why? Because he had neither house nor wife. He took a wife. He said to them: Whatever you bring me, from now on bring them up to the house. Thus all the days before Moses erected the tent of meeting, they offered sacrifices &#x007B;from&#x007D; [in] any place, as stated (in Exod. 24:5): <small>THEN HE SENT YOUTHS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND THEY OFFERED BURNT OFFERINGS</small>&#x2026;. And so it says (in Exod. 8:23): <small>LET US GO A DISTANCE OF THREE DAYS INTO THE WILDERNESS AND SACRIFICE TO THE LORD OUR GOD</small>. When the Tabernacle was raised, the [Holy One] said to Moses: From now on you are only permitted to offer sacrifice in the Tent of Meeting; and there they offered up the &#x007B;gifts&#x007D; [gift]<sup><xref rid="fn1208">81</xref></sup> to the Holy One. It is so stated (in Deut. 12:13&#x2013;14): <small>TAKE HEED THAT YOU DO NOT OFFER UP YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS</small> [<small>IN ANY PLACE THAT YOU SEE</small>], <small>BUT ONLY IN THE PLACE THAT THE LORD WILL CHOOSE</small> [<small>WITHIN ONE OF YOUR TRIBES. THERE SHALL YOU OFFER UP YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS</small>]. And where did the Holy One choose? Jerusalem, as stated (in Ps. 132:13): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN ZION</small>; [<small>HE HAS DESIRED IT FOR HIS DWELLING</small>]. Moses therefore warns Israel, saying (in Lev. 17:3&#x2013;4): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL &#x003C; SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB, OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND DOES NOT BRING IT UNTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING TO OFFER IT AS A SACRIFICE</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C; BLOODGUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED TO THAT PERSON &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.16 Leviticus 17:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Lev. 17:2:) <small>THIS IS THE THING</small>.] The Holy One foresaw that the Temple was going to be destroyed; so the Holy One said: As long as the Temple exists, you shall sacrifice within it, &#x003C; and &#x003E; there will be atonement for you; but when the Temple does not exist, how will there be atonement for you? Occupy yourselves with the words of Torah, because they are comparable with offerings, and they will atone for you. Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>THIS IS THE THING</small> (literally:<small>WORD</small>). So also the prophet says (in Hos. 14:3 [2]): <small>TAKE YOUR WORDS WITH YOU, &#x003C; AND RETURN UNTO THE LORD</small>&#x2026;; <small>LET US RENDER AS BULLOCKS THE OFFERING OF OUR LIPS &#x003E;</small>. The words of Torah resemble all the offerings. One offers wine as a libation upon the altar, as stated (in Numb. 15:5): <small>AND A QUARTER HIN OF WINE FOR A LIBATION</small>; and Torah resembles wine, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>AND DRINK OF THE WINE I HAVE MIXED</small>. &#x007B;And Torah resembles bread, as stated&#x007D; [One offers bread upon the altar, as stated (in Numb. 28:2): <small>MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING</small>; and so it says] (in Exod. 25:30): <small>AND YOU SHALL SET THE</small> [<small>SHOW</small>] <small>BREAD UPON THE TABLE</small> [<small>BEFORE ME ALWAYS</small>]; and Torah resembles bread, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. One offers oil upon the altar, as stated (in Lev. 2:5): <small>FINE FLOUR MIXED WITH OIL</small>; and Torah resembles oil, as stated (in Eccl. 9:8): <small>ALWAYS LET YOUR CLOTHES BE WHITE, AND LET THERE BE NO LACK OF OIL UPON YOUR HEAD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">82</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.17 Leviticus 17:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 17:3:) <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS</small>. R. Aqiva says: When Israel was in the desert, they would slaughter cattle by stabbing and eat them; but here &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; has forbidden them and says to them (ibid.): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. <sup><xref rid="fn1210">83</xref></sup>Then he told them: You are forbidden to slaughter apart from the Tent of Meeting (cf. vs. 4). R. Ishmael says: When Moses spoke to them, they were craving to eat meat. At that time they were cautioned<sup><xref rid="fn1211">84</xref></sup> away from slaughtering, i.e., not to slaughter apart from the Tent of Meeting. And why so? It is simply that up to then they had been lusting after idols. Where is it shown that they were lusting after idols? Where it is stated (in Lev. 17:7): <small>AND THEY SHALL NO LONGER OFFER SACRIFICES &#x003C; TO THE GOAT DEMONS AFTER WHOM THEY WENT WHORING &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1212">85</xref></sup> When they wished to enter the Land of Israel, they came to Moses. They said to him: O Our Master, If we wish to eat flesh, how shall we do so? He said to them: In the past, when you were in the desert, you were forbidden to slaughter apart from the Tent of Meeting; but when you enter the land, you are permitted to slaughter in any place, as stated (in Deut. 12:20): <small>WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD ENLARGES YOUR TERRITORY, AS HE PROMISED YOU, AND YOU SAY: LET ME EAT MEAT, BECAUSE YOUR SOUL LONGS TO EAT FLESH, &#x003C; YOU MAY EAT FLESH TO YOUR SOUL&#x2019;S DESIRE &#x003E;</small>. He said to them: When I shall have permitted you to slaughter, you may not take from your flock and slaughter. Solomon said (in Prov. 27:27): <small>AND THERE WILL BE ENOUGH GOAT&#x2019;S MILK FOR YOUR FOOD, FOR THE FOOD OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD</small>. Moses was teaching Israel by saying to them: If you have sheep which you shear for your clothing, &#x003C; then &#x003E; as stated (in Prov. 27:26): <small>THE SHEEP WILL BE FOR YOUR CLOTHES, AND THE HE-GOATS THE PRICE OF A FIELD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND THE HE-GOATS THE PRICE OF A FIELD</small>? That whatever you gain from the goats, you are to buy fields with it.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">86</xref></sup> (Prov. 27:27): <small>AND THERE WILL BE ENOUGH GOAT&#x2019;S MILK</small>. You will have enough <small>GOAT&#x2019;S MILK FOR YOUR FOOD, FOR THE FOOD</small><sup><xref rid="fn1214">87</xref></sup> <small>OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD</small>. R. Aqiva said: See how the Holy One cares for the assets of the righteous and Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">88</xref></sup> See what is written (in Deut. 12:21): <small>THEN YOU MAY</small> &#x007B;<small>TAKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>SLAUGHTER</small>] <small>SOME OF YOUR CATTLE OR FLOCK</small>. Some of what they bear.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">89</xref></sup> You shall only take and sacrifice some of what they give birth to. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 15:19): <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL CONSECRATE TO THE LORD &#x003E; ALL THE MALE FIRSTLINGS WHICH ARE BORN IN YOUR HERD AND IN YOUR FLOCK</small>. [You are permitted to sacrifice some of what they give birth to.] R. Eleazar [ben Azariah] said: The Torah has taught you a rule of conduct.<sup><xref rid="fn1217">90</xref></sup> If someone from Israel should have ten pounds<sup><xref rid="fn1218">91</xref></sup> of silver, let him eat green vegetables in the pot; if he has twenty, let him eat them in a casserole;<sup><xref rid="fn1219">92</xref></sup> if he has thirty, let him eat a pound of meat from Sabbath to Sabbath; and if he has fifty, let him eat meat on each [and every] day. Now why all this? In order to care for the assets of Israel. R. Eleazar ben Shammua&#x2018; said: And when he buys from Sabbath to Sabbath, he should not buy until he consults within his household. Where is it shown? &#x003C; In Deut. 12:21. &#x003E; Because it is so written (in Deut. 12:20): [<small>WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD ENLARGES YOUR TERRITORY</small>,] <small>AS HE PROMISED YOU, AND YOU SAY: LET ME EAT MEAT &#x003C; BECAUSE YOUR SOUL LONGS TO EAT FLESH, YOU MAY EAT FLESH TO YOUR SOUL&#x2019;S DESIRE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. For this reason Moses warned them and gave them a hint (in vs. 21), so that they would not do too much slaughtering.</p>

Whenever anyone steals his comrade&#x2019;s bull and slaughters it, it is as if he slays its owner.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">93</xref></sup> Another interpretation of <small>ONE WHO SLAUGHTERS</small> (<italic>shohet</italic>) <small>THE BULL SLAYS A HUMAN</small>. (<italic>Zev.</italic> 14:4:) <small>BEFORE THE TABERNACLE WAS SET UP, ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE CATTLE</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIGH PLACES</small>] <small>WERE PERMITTED</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;; &#x003E; <small>BUT SINCE THE TABERNACLE HAS BEEN SET UP</small>, [<small>THE HIGH PLACES HAVE BEEN FORBIDDEN</small>.] The Holy One said: Whoever sacrifices a bull apart from the Tent of Meeting is like one who slays a person. [It is as though he has taken (<italic>shohet</italic>) a life.] Thus it is stated (in Lev. 17:4): <small>BLOODGUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED</small> [<small>TO THAT PERSON: HE HAS SHED BLOOD</small>]. So whoever slaughters (<italic>shohet</italic>) at the Tabernacle [honors me, as stated (in Ps. 50:23): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES A THANK OFFERING</small>] <small>HONORS ME</small>. Now what reward shall I repay to him? When I bring salvation to Israel, he will have the right to see it, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND TO THE ONE WHO SETS HIS WAY ARIGHT I WILL SHOW THE SALVATION OF GOD</small>. R. Abbahu said: All salvation that comes to Israel is of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 91:15&#x2013;16): <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small> [&#x2026;, <small>AND SHOW HIM MY SALVATION</small>]. Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as you said, <small>I WILL BE WITH HIM IN DISTRESS</small>, he is saved, as it were; &#x003C; therefore &#x003E; (in the words of Ps. 60:7 [5]), <small>SAVE WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND AND ANSWER ME</small>. Thus if you answer us, salvation is yours, as stated (in Ps. 80:2&#x2013;3 [1&#x2013;2]) <small>&#x003C; GIVE EAR, O SHEPHERD OF ISRAEL</small>,&#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND COME TO SAVE US</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: See what is written (in Zech. 9:9): <small>REJOICE GREATLY, O DAUGHTER OF ZION</small>&#x2026;; <small>BEHOLD YOUR KING COMES TO YOU RIGHTEOUS AND SAVED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">94</xref></sup> &#x003C; The active voice, &#x003E; &#x201C;saving&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x003C; the passive &#x003E; <small>SAVED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">95</xref></sup> And so it [says] (in Is. 62:11): <small>SAY TO THE DAUGHTER OF ZION: BEHOLD, YOUR SALVATION IS COMING</small>. &#x201C;Your savior&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>YOUR SALVATION</small>. [He, as it were, was saved.] R. Meir said: (concerning Exod. 14:30): <small>SO THE LORD SAVED</small> (<italic><small>WYWSh</small></italic>&#x2018;, voweled as <italic>wayyosha</italic>&#x2018;) <small>&#x003C; ISRAEL &#x003E; ON THAT DAY</small>: The written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) &#x003C; reads &#x003E; <small>SO &#x003C; THE LORD &#x003E; WAS SAVED</small> (<italic><small>WYWSh</small></italic>&#x2018;, voweled as <italic>wayyiwwasha</italic>&#x2018;) <small>&#x003C; ON THAT DAY WITH ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1223">96</xref></sup> When Israel, as it were, was redeemed, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; was redeemed. R. Meir said: Moses praised the congregation of Israel (in Deut. 33:29): <small>BLESSED ARE YOU, O ISRAEL</small>&#x0021; <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU, A PEOPLE</small> [<small>SAVED THROUGH THE LORD</small>]. &#x201C;A people the Lord saved&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>A PEOPLE SAVED THROUGH THE LORD</small>. It is comparable to a person who had a seah of wheat for a second tithe. What does he do? He gives coins to redeem it. So &#x003C; it was &#x003E; in the case of Israel. Through what were they redeemed? Through the Holy One, as it were: <small>A PEOPLE SAVED THROUGH THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you are saved by means of flesh and blood: in Egypt by means of Moses and Aaron, in the days of Sisera by means of Barak and Deborah; among the Midianites by means of Shamgar ben Anath,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">97</xref></sup> and so on through the Judges. [But because they were flesh and blood, you again became enslaved]. However, in the world to come, I myself will redeem you, and you will never again be enslaved. Thus it is stated (in Is. 45:17): <small>ISRAEL HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE LORD WITH AN EVERLASTING SALVATION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1225">98</xref></sup></p>

Were there a lot of thrones, when &#x003C; there is &#x003E; that which is written (in Is. 6:1): <small>I SAW THE LORD SEATED UPON A THRONE</small> (in the singular)? What is the meaning of <small>THRONES</small>? R. Jose the Galilean and R. Aqiva differed.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">3</xref></sup> One said: <small>THRONES</small> denotes the throne plus its <italic>hypopodion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1229">4</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., its footstool&#x007D;; and the other said: These are thrones that belong to the nations of the world, since the Holy One is going to throw them down, as stated (in Hag. 2:22): <small>THEN I WILL THROW DOWN THE THRONE</small>&#x003C; S &#x003E; <small>OF KINGDOMS, AND DESTROY THE KINGDOMS OF THE GENTILES</small>. You know [for yourself] that this is so. &#x201C;Thrones were set up,&#x201D; is not written here (in Dan. 7:9), but <small>THRONES WERE THROWN DOWN</small>. Thus it is written (in Exod. 15:1 or 21): <small>THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HE HAS THROWN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RMH</small></italic>) <small>INTO THE SEA</small>. &#x003C; Our &#x003E; masters say: What is the meaning of <small>THRONES</small>? In the age to come the Holy One will sit down, and the angels will place thrones for the great ones of Israel for them to sit down, so that the Holy One will be sitting with them like the president of the court (<italic>av bet din</italic>). Then they shall judge the peoples of the world, as stated (in Is. 3:14): <small>THE LORD WILL COME IN JUDGMENT ALONG WITH THE ELDERS OF HIS PEOPLE AND THEIR PRINCES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;Against the elders of his people&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>ALONG WITH THE ELDERS &#x003C; OF HIS PEOPLE &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; is teaching that the Holy One will sit along with the elders and princes of Israel to judge the nations of the world. And which &#x003C; thrones &#x003E; are they? These are the thrones of the house of David and the elders of Israel, as stated (in Ps. 122:5): <small>THERE STOOD THE THRONES OF JUDGMENT, THRONES OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>. R. Pinhas said in the name of R. Hilqiyah the Southerner (i.e., from Judah), &#x003C; who spoke &#x003E; in the name of R. Reuben: If you say: When thrones stand there for judgment, they are thrones of the house of David. Then what is &#x003C; the meaning of &#x003E; (Dan. 7:9): <small>AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT</small>? That he sits among them like the president of the court, and with them he judges the nations. It is therefore written (ibid.): <small>UNTIL THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE</small>. What is the meaning of (ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKE CLEAN WOOL</small>? When the Holy One cleanses himself from the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn1231">6</xref></sup> he gives them compensation for the easy commandments which they have observed in this world. &#x003C; He does so &#x003E; in order to judge them and convict them in the world to come, so that they will have no excuse and have no merit found for them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 14:32): <small>AND WHAT WILL HE ANSWER THE ANGELS OF</small><sup><xref rid="fn1232">7</xref></sup> A <small>&#x003C; GIVEN &#x003E; NATION? THAT THE LORD HAS ESTABLISHED ZION, AND IN IT THERE SHALL THE AFFLICTED OF HIS PEOPLE TAKE REFUGE</small>. Then he immediately renders the judgment against them. At that time the Holy One becomes exalted in his world, as stated (in Is. 5:16): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS IS EXALTED IN JUDGMENT</small>, [<small>AND THE HOLY GOD IS SANCTIFIED IN JUSTICE</small>]. What is the meaning of (ibid.): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS IS EXALTED IN JUDGMENT</small>? That he is sanctified in his world in justice, because he teaches concerning Israel what is stated (in Is. 63:1): <small>I SPEAK IN JUSTICE</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: I am sanctified in you, as stated (in Is. 29:23): <small>FOR WHEN &#x003C; JACOB &#x003E; SEES HIS CHILDREN IN HIS MIDST, THE WORK OF MY HANDS, THEY SHALL SANCTIFY MY NAME; YES, THEY SHALL SANCTIFY THE HOLY ONE OF JACOB</small>&#x2026;. And so it says (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>. So you are sanctified in me, and I am sanctified in you, as stated (in Lev. 11:44; cf. 19:2): [<small>SO YOU SHALL SANCTIFY YOURSELVES</small>] <small>AND BE HOLY, BECAUSE I AM HOLY</small>.</p>
<title>7.2 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Before I created my world, the ministering angels praised my name through you and sanctified me through you by saying (in I Chron. 16:36): <small>BLESSED IS THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1233">8</xref></sup> When the first Adam was created, the angels said: Sovereign of the World, is this the one in whose name we are praising you? He told them, [No]. This person is a thief, since it is stated (of him in Gen. 3:17): <small>&#x003C; BECAUSE YOU OBEYED YOUR WIFE AND &#x003E; ATE OF THE TREE ABOUT WHICH I COMMANDED YOU, &#x003C; SAYING: DO NOT EAT OF IT. CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; When &#x003E; Noah came, they said to him (i.e., to the Holy One): Is this the one? He told them, [No]. This person is a drunkard, since it is stated (of him in Gen. 9:21): <small>THEN HE DRANK OF THE WINE AND BECAME DRUNK</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; When &#x003E; Abraham came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them: This is a stranger (<italic>ger</italic>). &#x003C; When &#x003E; Isaac came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them: This one loves my enemy, as stated (in Gen. 25:28): <small>NOW ISAAC LOVED ESAU</small>. When Jacob came, they said to him: Is this the one? He told them, Yes, for so it says (in Gen. 35:10): <small>GOD SAID TO HIM: YOUR NAME SHALL NO LONGER BE JACOB, BUT YOUR NAME SHALL BE ISRAEL</small>&#x2026;. So all Israel was called by his name. At that time the Holy One, Blessed be He, sanctified them because of his name, as stated (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>. The Holy One said to him: Since you were sanctified for my name before I created my world, Be holy as I am holy. It is so stated (in Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY, BECAUSE I, THE LORD YOUR GOD, AM HOLY</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who betrothed a wife. He said to her because you have been betrothed (literally: sanctified) to my name, I am a king and you, a queen. Just as it (i.e., my name) is an honor for me, so it is an honor for you. Why? Because you are my wife. Thus the Holy One said to Moses. Go and sanctify (i.e., go and betroth) Israel, as stated (in Exod. 19:10): <small>GO UNTO THE PEOPLE AND SANCTIFY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) <small>THEM TODAY AND TOMORROW</small>. &#x007B;The Holy One sanctified them&#x007D; [He sanctified them. The Holy One came] and said to them (in Exod. 19:6): <small>BUT YOU SHALL BE FOR ME A KINGDOM OF PRIESTS, A HOLY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) <small>NATION</small>. Why? (Lev. 19:2:) <small>BECAUSE</small>&#x2026; <small>I AM HOLY</small>. And you also shall be sanctified (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) just as you have sanctified me, as stated (in Lev. 19:2) <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>)&#x2026;. The Holy One said unto them: If you are worthy, you shall be called a congregation of saints (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>); &#x003C; if &#x003E; you are unworthy, you shall be called an evil congregation. (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small>&#x2026;?</p>
<title>7.3 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:2:) <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. What reason did he have to speak this parashah in an assembly?<sup><xref rid="fn1234">9</xref></sup> Why did he not say: <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, as in the rest of the parashiot,<sup><xref rid="fn1235">10</xref></sup> rather than <small>&#x003C; SPEAK &#x003E; UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION &#x003C; OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>? Because all of the &#x003C; Ten &#x003E; Commandments are included within it. How?</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:2 &#x003D; Deut. 5:6): I <small>&#x003C; AM &#x003E; THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:2): I <small>&#x003C; AM &#x003E; THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:3 &#x003D; Deut. 5:7): <small>YOU SHALL HAVE NO &#x003C; OTHER GODS BESIDE ME &#x003E;</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:4): <small>DO NOT TURN UNTO IDOLS</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:7 &#x003D; Deut. 5:11): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE &#x003C; THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN &#x003E;</small>; and here (in Lev. 19:12): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SWEAR FALSELY BY MY NAME</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:8; cf. Deut. 5:12): <small>REMEMBER</small> [<small>THE SABBATH DAY</small>]; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:3): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY SABBATHS</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:12 &#x003D; Deut. 5:16); <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:3, cont.): <small>YOU EACH SHALL FEAR HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 &#x003D; Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT MURDER</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:16): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STAND OVER THE BLOOD OF YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [14] &#x003D; Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:2): <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [15] &#x003D; Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:11): <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:13 [16] &#x003D; Deut. 5:17): <small>YOU SHALL NOT BEAR &#x003C; FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR &#x003E;</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:16): <small>YOU SHALL NOT GO AROUND AS A SLANDERER AMONG YOUR PEOPLE</small>.</li>
<li>In the Commandments it is written (in Exod. 20:14 [17] &#x003D; Deut. 5:18): <small>YOU SHALL NOT COVET</small>; and here it is written (in Lev. 19:13): <small>YOU SHALL NOT OPPRESS YOUR NEIGHBOR, AND YOU SHALL NOT ROB HIM</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is [why the Holy One told him to speak this parashah in an assembly.] Because all of the &#x003C; Ten &#x003E; Commandments are included within it. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 19:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>7.4 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 19:2:) <small>SPEAK UNTO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>&#x003C; AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>: &#x003E; <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY, BECAUSE</small> I<small>&#x003C;</small> , <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD, &#x003E; AM HOLY</small>. The Holy One said to them: Be holy just as I am holy in every respect.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">11</xref></sup> See what is written (in Josh. 24:19): <small>FOR HE IS A HOLY GOD</small> (in the plural).<sup><xref rid="fn1237">12</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>FOR HE IS A HOLY GOD</small> (in the plural)? This verse &#x003C; provides &#x003E; an opening for the heretics (<italic>minim</italic>), in that he seems like two powers.<sup><xref rid="fn1238">13</xref></sup> The heretics asked R.

He said to them: You idiots&#x0021; [See what is written: <small>FOR HE IS A HOLY GOD</small> (in the plural). You would say: They are &#x003C; at least &#x003E; two powers, [for why are <small>GOD</small> and <small>HOLY</small> plural?] R. Berekhyah said in the name of R. Abba: What is the meaning of <small>HE IS A HOLY &#x003C; GOD &#x003E;</small> (with <small>HOLY</small> in the plural)? That he is holy in all categories of holiness. How? R. Aha bar Hanina said: His speech is in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 60:8 [6]): <small>GOD SPOKE IN HIS HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place, the Temple). His way is in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 77:14 [13]): <small>YOUR WAY, O GOD, IS IN HOLINESS</small> (i.e., in the Holy Place). He is seen in holiness, as stated (in Ps. 63:3 [2]): <small>SO I HAVE BEHELD YOU IN HOLINESS</small>, (i.e., in the Holy Place). His praise<sup><xref rid="fn1240">15</xref></sup> is in holiness, as stated (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU, GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS</small>? The uncovering of his arm is in holiness, as stated (in Is. 52:10): <small>THE LORD HAS UNCOVERED &#x003C; HIS ARM OF HOLINESS &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Josh. 24:19) <small>HE IS A HOLY GOD</small> (with <small>HOLY</small> in the plural), because he is holy in all categories of holiness.</p>
<title>7.5 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. Why? (<italic>Ibid</italic>., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE</small> I<small>&#x003C;</small> , <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD, &#x003E; AM HOLY</small>; for I have made you cling to my loins, as stated (in Jer. 13:11): <small>FOR, AS THE GIRDLE CLINGS UNTO ONE&#x2019;S LOINS, &#x003C; SO I HAVE MADE ALL THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND ALL THE HOUSE OF JUDAH CLING TO ME, SAYS THE LORD &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">16</xref></sup> The Holy One said to them, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; to Israel, I am not like flesh and blood. With a king of flesh and blood, mortals have no right to be called by his name. You yourself know that, when someone wants to accuse<sup><xref rid="fn1242">17</xref></sup> his fellow, he calls him Augustus<sup><xref rid="fn1243">18</xref></sup> so-and-so; and there is no life for him. But Israel is called by the name of the Holy One. He is called God; and he has called Israel gods, as stated (in Ps. 82:6): <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS</small>. He is called wise, as stated (in Job 9:4): <small>ONE WISE OF HEART AND MIGHTY IN STRENGTH</small>; and he has called Israel wise, as stated (in Deut. 4:6): <small>SURELY THIS GREAT NATION IS A WISE AND UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE</small>. God is called beloved, as stated (in Cant. 5:10): <small>MY BELOVED IS BRIGHT AND RUDDY</small>; and he has called them beloved, as stated (Cant. 5:1): <small>EAT, FRIENDS, AND DRINK TO EXCESS, BELOVED ONES</small>. He is called chosen, as stated (in Cant. 5:15): <small>STATELY</small> (literally: <small>CHOSEN</small>) <small>AS THE CEDARS</small>; and he has called them chosen, as stated (in Deut. 7:6): [<small>THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>] <small>HAS CHOSEN YOU</small>. He is called pious, as stated (in Jer. 3:12): <small>FOR</small> [I] <small>AM PIOUS, SAYS THE LORD</small>; and he has called them pious, as stated (in Ps. 50:5): <small>GATHER TO ME, MY PIOUS ONES</small>. He is called holy, as stated (in Is. 6:3): <small>HOLY, HOLY, HOLY IS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>; and he has called Israel holy, [as stated (in Lev. 19:2): <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>.] The Holy One said: In this world you have been called holy, but in the world to come (according to Is. 4:3): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE ONE WHO IS LEFT IN ZION AND WHO REMAINS IN JERUSALEM SHALL BE CALLED HOLY</small>.</p>
<title>7.6 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: R. Reuben said: What is the meaning of that which is written (in Ezek. 3:12): <small>AND AFTER ME</small><sup><xref rid="fn1244">19</xref></sup> <small>I HEARD A GREAT ROARING SOUND</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AFTER ME</small> (&#x2019;<small>HRY</small>)?<sup><xref rid="fn1245">20</xref></sup> After (&#x2019;<small>HRY</small>) I and my friends praised him, I heard the ministering angels, as they praised him and said (ibid., cont.): <small>BLESSED BE THE GLORY OF THE LORD FROM HIS PLACE</small>. It also says (in Job 38:7): <small>WHEN THE MORNING STARS</small> (i.e., the seed of Jacob)<sup><xref rid="fn1246">21</xref></sup> <small>SANG TOGETHER</small>, then (ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD</small> (i.e., all the angels) <small>SHOUTED FOR JOY</small>. R. Mani said: Let not the recitation of the Shema be trivial in your eyes because there are two hundred forty-eight words in it,<sup><xref rid="fn1247">22</xref></sup> corresponding to &#x003C; the number of &#x003E; parts that are in a human being; and out of them &#x003C; comes &#x003E; <small>BLESSED BE THE NAME OF HIS GLORIOUS MAJESTY FOREVER AND EVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1248">23</xref></sup> The Holy One said: If you have kept what is mine in reciting it properly, I will also keep what is yours. Therefore, David offered praise<sup><xref rid="fn1249">24</xref></sup> (in Ps. 17:8): <small>KEEP ME AS THE PUPIL OF AN EYE</small>. The Holy One said to him (in Prov. 4:4): <small>KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE</small>. R. Simeon ben Halafta said: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn1250">25</xref></sup> To someone who &#x003C; lives &#x003E; in Galilee and has a vineyard in Judea, while someone in Judea has a vineyard in Galilee. The one who &#x003C; lives &#x003E; in Galilee goes to Judea to cultivate his vineyard. The one in Judea goes to Galilee to cultivate his vineyard. &#x003C; One day &#x003E; they meet with each another, and one said to the other: Instead of you coming to my place, keep watch over what is mine in your neighborhood; and I will keep watch over what is yours in my neighborhood. So did David say (in Ps. 17:4): <small>KEEP ME AS THE PUPIL OF AN EYE</small>? The Holy One said to him (in Prov. 4:4): <small>KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS AND LIVE</small>. Similarly the Holy One said to Israel: Keep my commandment, the commandment to recite the Shema morning and evening, and I will keep you, as stated (in Ps. 121:7): <small>THE LORD SHALL KEEP YOU FROM ALL EVIL; HE SHALL KEEP YOUR SOUL</small>.</p>
<title>7.7 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>NOW WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD</small>. This text is related (to Zech. 8:11&#x2013;12): <small>BUT NOW &#x003C; I WILL NOT TREAT THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE &#x003E; AS IN THE FORMER DAYS</small>&#x2026;; <small>FOR AS THE SEED OF PEACE, THE VINE SHALL YIELD ITS FRUIT, THE EARTH SHALL YIELD ITS HARVEST</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>NOT</small>&#x2026; <small>AS IN THE FORMER DAYS</small>? When Israel went forth from Egypt and was walking in the desert, he brought down manna for them, brought over quails for them, and raised up the well for them.<sup><xref rid="fn1251">26</xref></sup> Then each and every tribe made itself a conduit for water, which [drew &#x003C; the water &#x003E; from the well and] brought it in to them. Moreover, [each and every one] planted fig trees, vines, and pomegranates, which yielded fruit on the same day, just as it was from the beginning at the creation of the world (according to Gen. 1:11): <small>FRUIT TREE BEARING FRUIT ACCORDING TO ITS KIND</small>. If the children of Adam had been worthy, it would have remained so until now. A person would plant a tree, and it would bear fruit immediately. When Adam sinned, the ground was cursed (according to Gen. 3:17): <small>CURSED IS THE LAND BECAUSE OF YOU</small>. From now on (ibid., cont.:) <small>IN TOIL YOU SHALL YOU EAT OF IT ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE</small>. He sowed wheat and it sprouted thistles, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>THORNS AND THISTLES SHALL IT SPROUT FOR YOU</small>. When they went forth from Egypt, [the Holy One] raised up the well for them. Then they made plantings beside its water, and the trees bore fruit on the same day. When the well disappeared, [all the bounty disappeared.] What is written there (in Numb. 20:5)? <small>A PLACE WITH NO SEEDS, FIGS, VINES, OR POMEGRANATES</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: Say to these Israelites: When you enter the land of Israel, I am restoring all the bounty to you, as stated (in Deut. 8:7&#x2013;9): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND, &#x003C; A LAND WITH STREAMS OF WATER &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;; <small>A LAND OF WHEAT AND BARLEY, OF VINES, FIGS, AND POMEGRANATES</small>&#x2026;; <small>A LAND &#x003C; IN &#x003E; WHICH &#x003C; YOU SHALL EAT BREAD &#x003E; WITHOUT STINT</small>. When they came into the land of Israel they began sinning (rt.: <italic><small>HT</small></italic>&#x2019;), as stated (in Jer. 2:7): <small>BUT YOU CAME AND DEFILED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HT</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>MY LAND</small>. So it did not bear fruits as was appropriate. They planted much and brought in little, as stated (in Hag. 1:6): <small>YOU HAVE SOWN MUCH AND BROUGHT IN LITTLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">27</xref></sup> Why? Because they ceased &#x003C; offering &#x003E; the firstfruits. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE EATEN WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>, after &#x007B;the first fruits&#x007D; [the shewbread] ceased. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE DRUNK WITHOUT HAVING ENOUGH</small>, after the libation of wine ceased. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON CLOTHES, WITHOUT BEING WARM</small>, after the vestments of priesthood were abolished. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE WAGE EARNER HAS EARNED WAGES FOR A BAG WITH HOLES</small>, after almsgiving ceased. (Zech. 8:10:) <small>A PERSON HAD NO EARNINGS</small>, after pilgrims (going up to Jerusalem) ceased. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE CATTLE EARNED NOTHING</small>, after the offerings ceased. But in the age to come, the Holy One will not act so. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 8:11&#x2013;12): <small>BUT NOW I WILL NOT TREAT THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE AS IN THE FORMER DAYS, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS; FOR AS THE SEED OF PEACE, THE VINE SHALL YIELD ITS FRUIT, THE EARTH SHALL YIELD ITS HARVEST, THE HEAVENS SHALL YIELD THEIR DEW, AND I WILL BEQUEATH ALL THESE THINGS TO THE REMNANT OF THIS PEOPLE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>7.8 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Even though you find it (i.e., the land) full of all bounty, you shall not say: Let us settle down and not plant.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">28</xref></sup> Rather, be careful in planting, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD</small>. Just as you came in and found plantings which others had planted, so you shall plant for your children, lest someone say: Since I am old and tomorrow I shall die, why should I toil for others. Solomon said (in Eccl. 3:11): <small>HE HAS MADE EVERYTHING BEAUTIFUL IN ITS TIME. HE ALSO HAS PUT ETERNITY INTO THEIR HEART. ETERNITY</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>LM</small></italic>) is what is written (without the <italic>W</italic> of the normal spelling, i.e., &#x2018;<italic><small>WLM</small></italic>.) Why? If the Holy One had not hidden (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LM</small></italic>) the day of &#x003C; one&#x2019;s &#x003E; death from the children of Adam, a person would neither build nor plant; for he would have said: Tomorrow I shall die. Why should I persist in toiling for the sake of others? The Holy One, therefore, shut off (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LM</small></italic>) human hearts from death, so that one would build and plant. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he is worthy, [it will be] for himself; &#x003C; if &#x003E; unworthy, &#x003C; it will be &#x003E; for others. There is a story about the emperor Hadrian, that he was going to war and traveling with his troops to fight with a certain country for having rebelled against him.<sup><xref rid="fn1254">29</xref></sup> Now he found a certain old man who was planting fig saplings. Hadrian said to him: You are an old man. &#x003C; Why are you &#x003E; persisting in taking the trouble to toil for others? He said to Hadrian: My Lord Emperor, here I am planting. If I am worthy, I shall eat of the fruit of my saplings; but if not, my children will eat. &#x003C; The emperor &#x003E; spent three years at war, and after three years he returned. What did that old man do? He took a fruit basket, filled it with the firstfruits of beautiful figs, and drew near to Hadrian. He said to him: My Lord Emperor: Take these figs, for I am the same old man whom you found when you were on your way &#x003C; to the war &#x003E;, when you said: You are an old man. Why are you taking the trouble to toil for others? See, the Holy One has already found me worthy to eat some fruit from my saplings. Now this &#x003C; fruit &#x003E; in my fruit basket is from those &#x003C; saplings &#x003E;. Hadrian said to his servants: Take it from him and fill it with gold coins. And so they did. The old man took the fruit basket full of gold coins and began to go about his house boasting to his wife and children. So he told them the story. Now a woman neighbor of his was there. She heard what the old man had said. She said to her husband: When all the children of Adam go &#x003C; through life &#x003E;, the Holy One gives to them and prepares bounty for them. But you dwell in your dark house in dark misfortune. See, our [neighbor] honored the emperor with a fruit basket of figs; and he filled it with gold coins for him. Now you get up, take a large basket, and fill it with varieties of choice fruit, with apples, figs, and the other varieties of beautiful fruit, since he loves them a lot. Go and honor him with them. Perhaps he will fill it with gold for you, as he did for our old neighbor. He went and heeded his wife. So he took a large basket, filled it with apples and figs, and loaded it on his shoulder. Then he approached the emperor on a side road<sup><xref rid="fn1255">30</xref></sup> and said to him: My Lord Emperor, I heard that you love fruit, I have come to honor you with figs and apples. The Emperor said to his officers:<sup><xref rid="fn1256">31</xref></sup> Take the basket and hit<sup><xref rid="fn1257">32</xref></sup> him on his face. And so they did. They hit him on his face, until his face swelled up; smashed his eyes; and made an example<sup><xref rid="fn1258">33</xref></sup> of him. So he went home as one of whom an example had been made and crying. Now she (i.e., his wife) thought that he was coming with a basket full of gold coins. So when she saw him with his face swollen and with his body shattered and beaten, she said to him: What is the matter with you? He said to her: When I heeded you and went to honor him with this gift,<sup><xref rid="fn1259">34</xref></sup> they hit me on my face. If I had listened to you and put varieties of hard fruit in the basket, they would already have pelted my face and my whole body with them. And why all this? In order to teach you that evil women destroy their husbands. Therefore one should not cease from planting. Rather, just as he found, one should still continue to plant even though he is old. The Holy One said to Israel: Learn from me. He spoke &#x003C; by example &#x003E;, as it were. (Gen. 2:8): <small>AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN IN EDEN, IN THE EAST</small>.</p>
<title>7.9 Leviticus 19:1ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:2:) <small>YOU SHALL BE HOLY</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 20:3 [2]): <small>MAY HE SEND YOU HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY AND SUSTAIN YOU FROM ZION. FROM THE SANCTUARY</small> (<italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) &#x003C; means &#x003E; from the holiness (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) of the works that are in you; <small>AND</small> [<small>SUSTAIN YOU</small>] <small>FROM ZION</small> (<italic><small>MTsYWN</small></italic>) &#x003C; means &#x003E; [from the marker (<italic><small>TsYWN</small></italic>)] of the works that are in you.<sup><xref rid="fn1260">35</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah said: There was a story in our village about a certain spirit who dwelt by the spring.<sup><xref rid="fn1261">36</xref></sup> Another spirit came to attack<sup><xref rid="fn1262">37</xref></sup> it and sought to get it away from there. There was also there a certain saint whose name was Jose the man of Zaythor. The first spirit appeared to him. It said to him: Rabbi, look at how many years I have been situated here; yet neither at noon nor at night have I harmed &#x003C; any &#x003E; mortal. &#x007B;Also not during the day.&#x007D; But now this spirit has come upon me from another place and wants to get me away from here in order to harm mortals. He said to it: What shall we do? It said to him: Take your staves and your scythes, and go out against it at the noon hour. Then say: Ours is winning&#x0021; Ours is winning&#x0021; And it will run away. They did so and drove it away from there. They used to say: They did not move from here until they saw, as it were, a clot of blood floating on the water. When the sages heard about the matter, they said: If something which was not created with a need for assistance needs assistance, how much the more so in the case of the children of Adam. David, therefore, said (in Ps. 20:3 [2]): <small>MAY HE SEND YOU HELP FROM THE SANCTUARY</small>.</p>
<title>7.10 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND AND PLANT</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 2:5): <small>I MADE GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR MYSELF, AND IN THEM I PLANTED EVERY KIND OF FRUIT TREE</small>. Do not all the children of Adam plant whatever they want?<sup><xref rid="fn1263">38</xref></sup> Whatever someone plants in the earth, it produces either pepper or something &#x003C; else &#x003E;. If someone plants, they produce, except that no one knows the place of every plant, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; where to plant it. However, because Solomon was wise, he planted all the species of trees, [as stated (ibid.): <small>I MADE GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR MYSELF, IN WHICH I PLANTED EVERY KIND OF FRUIT TREE</small>.] R. Jannay said: Solomon even planted peppers, but how did he plant them? It is simply that Solomon was wise and knew the root of the foundation of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">39</xref></sup> Where is it shown? (Ps. 50:2): <small>OUT OF ZION GOD HAS SHINED FORTH AS THE PERFECTION OF BEAUTY</small>. Out of Zion has all of the whole world been perfected. Why is it called &#x003C; Foundation &#x003E; Stone? Because out of it the world was founded.<sup><xref rid="fn1265">40</xref></sup> Now Solomon knew which vein went to Cush and planted peppers on it. They produced immediately. See what he says (in Eccl. 2:5): <small>AND IN THEM I PLANTED EVERY KIND OF FRUIT TREE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 2:5): <small>AND IN THEM I PLANTED</small>&#x2026;. Just as a navel is set in the middle of a person, so the land of Israel is the navel of the world. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 38:12): <small>WHO DWELL ON THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH</small>. The land of Israel sits at the center of the world; Jerusalem is in the center of the land of Israel; the sanctuary is in the center of Jerusalem; the Temple building is in the center of the sanctuary; the ark is in the center of the Temple building; and the foundation stone, out of which the world was founded, is before the Temple building.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">41</xref></sup> Now Solomon, who was wise, stood upon the roots that went out from &#x003C; that stone &#x003E; into the whole world and planted all species of trees in them. He therefore said (in Eccl. 2:5): <small>I MADE GARDENS AND ORCHARDS FOR MYSELF</small>.</p>
<title>7.11 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 19:23): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 105:44&#x2013;45): <small>HE GAVE THEM THE LANDS OF NATIONS</small>&#x2026;, <small>IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP HIS STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. <small>HE GAVE THEM THE LANDS OF NATIONS</small>. Whatever the Holy One took from the peoples of the world he gave to Israel: lands of silver and gold, fields, vineyards, and cities.<sup><xref rid="fn1267">42</xref></sup> But he gave &#x003C; these &#x003E; to them only so that they would occupy themselves with the Torah, as stated (vs. 45): <small>IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT KEEP HIS STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. But they did not do so. Instead (according to Ezek. 36:17): <small>AND THEY DEFILED</small> &#x007B;<small>THEM ACCORDING TO THEIR WAY</small>&#x007D; [<small>IT</small> (i.e., the land) <small>BY THEIR WAY AND BY THEIR DEEDS</small>]. They defiled them (according to Josh. 7) in the destruction of Achan, as stated (in Jer. 2:7): <small>BUT YOU CAME AND DEFILED MY LAND</small> [by the destruction of Achan]. (Ibid. cont.): <small>AND YOU MADE MY HERITAGE AN ABOMINATION</small>, by the image of Micah (in Jud. 17&#x2013;18). So what did the Holy One do to them? He exiled them from it, as stated (in Deut. 29:27): <small>SO THE LORD UPROOTED THEM FROM THEIR LAND</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND</small>&#x2026; <small>UPROOTED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTSh</small></italic>) <small>THEM</small>? He weakened (rt.: <italic><small>TShSh</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1268">43</xref></sup> their army. They planted and toiled, but the peoples of the world came and took. It is so stated (in Jud. 6:3): <small>AND SO IT HAPPENED THAT, IF ISRAEL PLANTED, &#x003C; MIDIAN, AMALEK, AND THE CHILDREN OF KEDEM WOULD ARISE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Then it is written (in vs. 4): <small>THEY WOULD ENCAMP AGAINST THEM AND DESTROY THE PRODUCE OF THE EARTH</small>. When they repent, (according to Is. 65:22): <small>THEY SHALL NOT BUILD FOR ANOTHER TO DWELL IN; THEY SHALL NOT PLANT FOR ANOTHER TO EAT</small>. Why? Because when they plant no one uproots, as stated (in Amos 9:15): <small>AND WHEN I PLANT THEM ON THEIR LAND, THEY SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE UPROOTED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTSh</small></italic>) <small>FROM THE LAND WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THEM, SAYS THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.</p>
<title>7.12 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 3:19): <small>BUT I SAID: HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND</small>&#x0021; &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is comparable to a king who had concubines and had a lot of children.<sup><xref rid="fn1269">44</xref></sup> But he had one child by a certain matron,<sup><xref rid="fn1270">45</xref></sup> and he loved him to excess. The king gave fields and vineyards to all the children of the concubines, and after that he gave his &#x003C; beloved &#x003E; son one garden<sup><xref rid="fn1271">46</xref></sup> from which all his food<sup><xref rid="fn1272">47</xref></sup> came. The son sent and said to his father: To the children of the concubines you have given fields and vineyards, but to me you have given one garden. The king said to him: By your life, all my food (<italic>cellaria</italic>) comes to me from this garden; and because I love you more than your brothers, I have given it to you. Similarly the Holy One created the peoples of the world, just as it is stated (in Cant. 6:8): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS</small>: These are the peoples. (Vs. 9): <small>&#x003C; ONLY &#x003E; ONE IS MY DOVE, &#x003C; MY PERFECT ONE &#x003E;</small>: This is the congregation of Israel. Now the Holy One has distributed [fields and vineyards] to the peoples of the world, as stated (in Deut. 32:8): <small>WHEN THE MOST HIGH GAVE THE GENTILES AN INHERITANCE</small>; but to Israel he has given the land of Israel, the larder (<italic>cellaria</italic>) of the Holy One. The offerings come from it; the shewbread comes from it; the first fruits come from it; the omer comes from it; all the good things in the world [come from it]. Why all this? In order to made a distinction between the son of the matron and the children of the concubines, as stated (in Jer. 3:19): <small>BUT I SAID: HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN &#x003C; AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND &#x003E;</small>&#x2026; &#x0021; There was great love between the Holy One and Israel; so how did they bring in the enmity.<sup><xref rid="fn1273">48</xref></sup> The Holy One said (ibid.): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT</small> (<italic>ashit</italic>) <small>YOU</small>, and this language can only be the language of enmity. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:15): <small>I WILL PUT</small> (<italic>ashit</italic>) <small>ENMITY BETWEEN YOU AND THE WOMAN</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>. The Holy One said to them: I have spoken in your defense.<sup><xref rid="fn1274">49</xref></sup> How have you made me bring charges<sup><xref rid="fn1275">50</xref></sup> against you? (Ibid.:) <small>HOW I WOULD PUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShYT</small></italic>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>. Now this can only be the language of an accuser,<sup><xref rid="fn1276">51</xref></sup> as stated (concerning one guilty of negligence in Exod. 21:30): <small>IF A RANSOM IS PUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ShYT</small></italic>) <small>UPON HIM</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>7.13 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>. Solomon said (in Prov. 31:16): <small>SHE SETS HER MIND ON A FIELD AND ACQUIRES IT</small>. Come and see.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">52</xref></sup> Whatever Abraham thought about in his heart the Holy One gave him. He thought [about] the land of [Israel], and he gave it to him, as stated (in Gen. 15:7): <small>I AM THE LORD WHO BROUGHT YOU OUT FROM UR OF THE CHALDEES</small> [<small>TO GIVE YOU THIS LAND AS A POSSESSION</small>]. Abraham said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the World, you have given me permission to say to you (in vs. 8): <small>HOW SHALL I KNOW &#x003C; THAT I SHALL POSSESS IT &#x003E;</small>? He replied and said to him (in vs. 13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL &#x003C; THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN IN A LAND NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM &#x003E;</small>. Woe to that person who brings something out of his mouth without knowing how he brought it out. Because &#x003C; Abraham &#x003E; said (in vs. 8): <small>HOW SHALL I KNOW</small>? his children were condemned to be enslaved in Egypt for four hundred years. So Solomon said (in Eccl. 6:7): <small>IS ALL HUMAN TOIL FOR ONE&#x2019;S MOUTH</small>&#x2026;? What is the meaning of <small>IS ALL HUMAN TOIL FOR ONE&#x2019;S MOUTH</small>&#x2026;? All the commandments and righteous deeds that one does. It is enough for the time that one&#x2019;s soul goes out of him. It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 6:7): <small>IS ALL HUMAN TOIL FOR ONE&#x2019;S MOUTH</small>? When Abraham heard &#x003C; from the Holy One &#x003E; (in Gen. 15:13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL</small>, he thought about it in his heart and said: &#x003C; Is it possible &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1278">53</xref></sup> that every people which enslaves my children goes away in peace and is not condemned? The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 15:14): <small>BUT &#x003C; I AM &#x003E; ALSO &#x003C; JUDGING &#x003E; THE NATION &#x003C; WHICH THEY SHALL SERVE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 31:16): <small>SHE SETS HER MIND ON A FIELD AND ACQUIRES IT</small>.</p>
<title>7.14 Leviticus 19:23ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 19:23:) <small>&#x003C; WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &#x003E; AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD, YOU SHALL COUNT</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RL</small></italic>) <small>ITS FRUIT AS FORBIDDEN</small> (literally: <small>AS FORESKIN</small>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RL</small></italic>)&#x2026;. &#x003C; This verse &#x003E; is teaching about an infant.<sup><xref rid="fn1279">54</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THREE YEARS IT SHALL BE FORBIDDEN</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RL</small></italic>) <small>FOR YOU</small>, when &#x003C; an infant &#x003E; can neither talk nor speak. (vs. 24:) <small>IN THE FOURTH YEAR ALL ITS FRUIT SHALL BE</small> [<small>SET ASIDE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>)], when his father dedicates (rt.: <italic><small>QDSh</small></italic>) him to the Torah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR PRAISES TO THE LORD</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>PRAISES</small> (with reference to an infant)?] &#x003C; Those offered &#x003E; from the time that he praises the Holy One. (Vs. 25:) <small>BUT IN THE FIFTH YEAR YOU MAY EAT ITS FRUIT</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; from the time that he begins to read in the Torah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO INCREASE ITS YIELD FOR YOU</small>. Hence our masters have taught (in <italic>Avot</italic> 5:21): <small>AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE &#x003C; HE IS READY &#x003E; FOR &#x003C; THE STUDY OF &#x003E; SCRIPTURE; AT TEN, FOR MISHNAH</small>. While in this world, one begets a son for himself, brings him to the elementary school, labors with him, and teaches him Torah. Then in the midst of troubles he dies. So he derives no happiness from him. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world, because the evil drive is found in you, you sin and your children die; but in the world to come I will remove the [evil] drive from among you.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">55</xref></sup> Then you shall beget and be happy, as stated (in Is. 65:23): <small>THEY SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, NOR BEAR CHILDREN IN TERROR, BECAUSE THEY ARE A SEED BLESSED OF THE LORD, AND THEIR OFFSPRING ALONG WITH THEM</small>.</p>
<title>7.15 Leviticus 20:9ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 20:9:) <small>FOR ANYONE WHATEVER WHO CURSES HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Solomon said (in Prov. 20:20): <small>&#x003C; IF SOMEONE &#x003E; CURSES HIS FATHER OR MOTHER, HIS LIGHT WILL GO OUT AT THE APPROACH OF DARKNESS</small>. Our Masters have said: Because Ham saw his father&#x2019;s nakedness, yet did not utter a curse at him, he and his descendants have &#x003C; only &#x003E; been alienated until the end of the whole world.<sup><xref rid="fn1281">56</xref></sup> How much worse it is for one who does curse his father&#x0021; The Scripture says (in Prov. 24:20): <small>FOR THERE WILL BE NO FUTURE FOR THE EVIL ONE, &#x003C; THE LAMP OF THE WICKED GOES OUT &#x003E;</small>. Come and see the honoring of father and mother, how dear it is before the Holy One; for the Holy One does not withhold his reward, either from the righteous or from the wicked. Where is it shown? From Esau the Wicked. Because he honored his father, the Holy One gave him all this honor. R. Eleazar says: Esau the Wicked shed three tears, [one] from his right eye, one from his left eye, and the third was attached in his eye and did not run down. When? When Isaac blessed Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:38): <small>AND ESAU LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND WEPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">57</xref></sup> So if the Holy One recompensed this wicked one, because he honored his father, how much the more &#x003C; will he do so &#x003E; in the case of one who honors his fathers. &#x003C; The Holy One &#x003E; said (in Job 41:3 [11]): <small>WHO HAS WELCOMED</small> (<italic>hiqdim</italic>) <small>ME THAT I SHOULD REPAY HIM</small>? [<small>EVERYTHING UNDER THE HEAVENS IS MINE</small>.] The Holy One said: Who is this one who has advanced (<italic>hiqdim</italic>) honor to his father, and I have not given him children? And so it says in Job (11:5&#x2013;7): <small>O THAT GOD WOULD SPEAK</small>&#x2026;; <small>AND THAT HE WOULD TELL YOU THE SECRETS OF WISDOM</small>&#x2026; &#x0021; <small>WOULD YOU DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GOD</small>&#x2026;? To what is Job comparable? To whoever is put in a <italic>collare</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1283">58</xref></sup> and said: I know what is within the palace<sup><xref rid="fn1284">59</xref></sup> of the king. They said to him: Free your self from the <italic>collare</italic>, and we shall know that you are speaking the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">60</xref></sup> So also Job was clothed in seven kinds of boils, and in need of alms, as stated (in Job 19:21): <small>HAVE PITY ON ME, HAVE PITY ON ME, O YOU MY FRIENDS, FOR THE HAND OF GOD HAS AFFLICTED ME</small>. He also says: I have reached the end of the works of the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Job 23:5): <small>I WOULD KNOW</small> &#x007B;<small>WHAT</small>&#x007D; <small>WORDS HE WOULD ANSWER ME</small> [<small>AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WOULD SAY TO ME</small>]. His companions said to him (in Job 11:7): <small>WOULD YOU DISCOVER THE MYSTERY OF GOD</small>&#x2026;? (Job 12:14:) <small>BEHOLD, WHATEVER HE</small> &#x007B;<small>CONDEMNS TO DESTRUCTION</small>&#x007D; [<small>DESTROYS</small>] <small>WILL NOT BE REBUILT</small>&#x2026;. Who, after he had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and had overthrown them, who has rebuilt them? No creature can stand on his own works, as stated (in Eccl. 7:13): <small>SEE THE WORK OF GOD; FOR WHO CAN MAKE STRAIGHT WHAT HE HAS MADE CROOKED</small>? The Holy One said: In this world the children of Adam are afflicted because of the evil drive, but in the world to come I will remove the evil drive from them.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">61</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:26&#x2013;27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU</small>&#x2026;.</p>

<title>Chapter 8 Leviticus, Parashah VIII: <italic>Emor</italic></title>
<title>8.1 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS, THE SONS OF AARON, &#x003C; AND SAY UNTO THEM: LET NO ONE DEFILE HIMSELF FOR A DEAD SOUL AMONG HIS PEOPLE &#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 12:7 [6]): <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>&#x2026;. Everything &#x003C; against &#x003E; which the Holy One warned Israel is for the sake of their holiness and their purity.<sup><xref rid="fn1287">1</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>. (Lev. 21:1:) <small>SPEAK</small> (literally: <small>SAY</small>) <small>UNTO THE PRIESTS, THE SONS OF AARON, AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>. Note that &#x201C;say&#x201D; &#x003C; occurs &#x003E; two times. To what is the matter comparable? To a cook who would go in and out before the king. The king said: I am commanding you not to look at a dead person all your days, since you come in and out before me, lest you defile my palace.<sup><xref rid="fn1288">2</xref></sup> Similarly, the Holy One had commanded the priests who enter the Temple not to be defiled for a dead person. It therefore says (in Lev. 21:1): <small>LET NO ONE DEFILE HIMSELF FOR A DEAD SOUL AMONG HIS PEOPLE</small>.</p>
<title>8.2 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 21:1): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 19:3&#x2013;4 [2&#x2013;3]): <small>ONE DAY POURS OUT SPEECH TO ANOTHER</small>&#x2026;; <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>. You find that in the days of autumn the day lends to the night, while in the days of summer the night lends to the day.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">3</xref></sup> (Vs. 4:) <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>. No creature hears &#x003C; about any difference &#x003E; between them, as stated (in Ps. 19:4 [3]): <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>, [<small>NOR IS THEIR VOICE HEARD</small>]. Down below, however, when the children of Adam lend to each other, how many quarrels they generate&#x0021; Thus it is stated (in Ps. 19:4&#x2013;5 [3&#x2013;4]): <small>THERE IS NO SPEECH, NOR ARE THERE WORDS</small>&#x2026;. [<small>THEIR LINE GOES OUT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EARTH, AND THEIR WORDS TO THE END OF THE WORLD</small>]. The heavenly creatures need neither talk nor speech, but earthly creatures need talk (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>), speech, and words (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>). (Lev. 21:1:) <small>SPEAK</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>)&#x2026; <small>AND SAY</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MR</small></italic>). Perhaps they will attend to them (i.e., the double command). Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>, [<small>AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>].</p>
<title>8.3 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 21:1): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 20:27)? <small>WHEN A MAN OR A WOMAN HAS A GHOST OR A FAMILIAR SPIRIT</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Is. 8:19): <small>AND WHEN THEY SAY UNTO YOU: INQUIRE OF GHOSTS AND FAMILIAR SPIRITS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1290">4</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Israel: If they say unto you: <small>INQUIRE OF GHOSTS</small>, and forsake the God who is in the heavens, say to them (ibid. cont.): <small>SHOULD NOT A PEOPLE INQUIRE OF ITS GOD</small>? Just as Elijah said to Ahaziah (in II Kings 1:3): <small>IS IT FOR LACK OF A GOD IN ISRAEL &#x003C; THAT YOU ARE SENDING TO INQUIRE OF BAAL-ZEBUB &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;? Why should we forsake the everlasting God? (Jer. 10:10:) <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD</small>; [<small>HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>]. It is also written (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE &#x003C; ALL &#x003E; ALIVE &#x003C; TODAY &#x003E;</small>. We therefore seek a living God; however, [the god&#x003C; s &#x003E; of] the nations of the world are dead, &#x003C; and &#x003E; (according to Ps. 115:8:) <small>THOSE WHO MAKE THEM SHALL BE LIKE THEM</small>. What is written after &#x003C; Is. 8:19 &#x003E;, (in vs. 20)? <small>FOR INSTRUCTION</small> (<italic>Torah</italic>) <small>AND FOR TESTIMONY</small>: [<small>IF THEY DO NOT SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD, SUCH A ONE SHALL HAVE NO DAWN</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn1291">5</xref></sup> R. Johanan and R. Laqish differed. R. Johanan said: The Holy One said: <small>IF THEY DO NOT SPEAK ACCORDING TO THIS WORD</small> to the nations of the world <small>THEY</small> (sic) <small>HAVE NO LIGHT</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn1292">6</xref></sup> [but R. Laqish says: <small>IT</small> (i.e., the word of a necromancer) <small>HAS NO LIGHT</small>.] The ghosts and the familiar spirits do not enlighten (literally: raise up the dawn) on their own, since they are &#x003C; themselves &#x003E; set in darkness; and all the more does this &#x003C; principle &#x003E; hold true for the nations of the world. So if you should say: Of whom shall we inquire? see, it says (in Deut. 17:9&#x2013;11): <small>AND YOU SHALL COME UNTO THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS AND UNTO THE JUDGE</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL ACT &#x003E; ACCORDING TO THE TORAH WHICH THEY SHALL TEACH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>8.4 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 20:27:) <small>WHEN A MAN OR A WOMAN HAS A GHOST OR A FAMILIAR SPIRIT</small>. What is written after that (in Lev. 21:1)? <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. What relation does the one have to the other? It is simply that the Holy One foresaw that Saul was going to be king over Israel and kill the priests; then inquire of a ghost and a familiar spirit. It is so stated (in I Sam. 28:7): <small>THEN SAUL SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO</small>] <small>HIS SERVANTS: SEEK ME OUT A WOMAN WHO CONTROLS A GHOST</small>. Resh Laqish said: To what is Saul comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn1293">7</xref></sup> To a king who entered a province and said: All the cocks in this province are to be slaughtered tonight. &#x003C; When &#x003E; he wished to depart on his way, he said: Is there no cock to crow here? They said to him: Did you not order them to be killed? Here also (in I Sam. 28:3) Saul had put away the ghosts and the familiar spirits; so Saul said (in vs. 7) <small>SEEK ME OUT A WOMAN WHO CONTROLS A GHOST</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; (Vs. 8:) <small>THEN SAUL DISGUISED HIMSELF</small>. What is the meaning of <small>DISGUISED HIMSELF</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HPSh</small></italic>)? That he had become divested (rt.: <italic><small>HPSh</small></italic>) of the kingship. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HE WENT WITH TWO MEN. WHO WERE THEY</small>? Abner and Amasai.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">8</xref></sup> Torah has taught proper protocol, that one does not leave on a journey (at night) by oneself; and our father Abraham acted accordingly (in Gen. 22:3): <small>AND HE</small> (i.e., Abraham) <small>TOOK WITH HIM TWO OF HIS SERVANTS</small> &#x007B;<small>AND HIS SON ISAAC</small>&#x007D;. And so (in I Sam. 28:8): <small>AND HE</small> (Saul) <small>WENT WITH TWO OF HIS SERVANTS</small> (sic). (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THEY CAME UNTO THE WOMAN AT NIGHT</small>. Was it at Night? It is simply that this time was for them as black as night. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN HE SAID: PLEASE DIVINE FOR ME THROUGH A GHOST</small>&#x2026;. (Vs. 9:) <small>BUT SHE SAID UNTO</small> &#x007B;<small>SAUL</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIM</small>]: <small>SEE HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT SAUL HAS DONE, HOW HE HAS ROOTED OUT THE GHOSTS AND THE FAMILIAR</small> &#x007B;<small>SPIRIT</small>&#x007D; [<small>SPIRITS</small>] <small>&#x003C; FROM THE LAND &#x003E;</small>. Immediately (in vs. 10): <small>SAUL SWORE TO HER BY THE LORD, SAYING</small>: [<small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>,] <small>NO PUNISHMENT SHALL BEFALL YOU OVER THIS MATTER</small>. Resh Laqish said: To what is Saul comparable? To a woman who was situated with her lover and swore by the life of her husband. (Vs. 11:) <small>THEN THE WOMAN SAID: WHOM</small> (<italic>mi</italic>) <small>SHALL I BRING UP FOR YOU</small>? One of those who say (as in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO</small> (<italic>mi</italic>) <small>IS LIKE YOU &#x003C; AMONG THE GODS, O LORD &#x003E;</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1295">9</xref></sup> or one of those who say (as in Exod. 5:2:)<sup><xref rid="fn1296">10</xref></sup> <small>WHO IS THE LORD</small>? He said to her (in I Sam. 28:11, cont.:) <small>BRING UP SAMUEL FOR ME</small>. She did what she did and brought him up. (Vs. 12:) <small>WHEN THE WOMAN SAW SAMUEL, SHE CRIED OUT</small> [<small>WITH</small>] <small>A LOUD VOICE, AND &#x003C; THE WOMAN &#x003E; SPOKE &#x003C; UNTO SAUL, SAYING &#x003E;: WHY HAVE YOU DECEIVED ME? FOR YOU ARE SAUL</small>. How did she know? Our masters have said: &#x003C; A ghost &#x003E; does not come up for a king as it comes up for a commoner.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">11</xref></sup> For the king its face is up and its feet down, just like everyone &#x003C; on earth &#x003E;; but for the commoner its feet are up and its face down. (Vs. 13:) <small>THEN THE KING SAID TO HER</small>: [<small>DO NOT BE AFRAID; FOR</small>] <small>WHAT DO YOU SEE? AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO SAUL: I SEE A GOD COMING UP FROM THE EARTH. COMING UP</small> (here in the plural form) implies two. So who were they? Moses and Samuel. When Saul heard this, he was afraid, because he had called one, but two had arisen. (Vs. 14:) <small>THEN HE SAID TO HER: WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? AND SHE SAID: AN OLD MAN IS COMING UP, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>. They have said three things about bringing up a ghost. 1. The one bringing it up sees it but does not hear its voice. 2. The one asking for it hears its voice but does not see it. 3. Those standing there neither see it nor hear its voice. (Ibid.:) <small>AN OLD MAN IS COMING UP, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE</small>. And elsewhere it says (in I Sam. 2:19): <small>HIS MOTHER WOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROBE FOR HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1298">12</xref></sup> &#x003C; This verse &#x003E; teaches that the robe grew on him. In it he was buried; in it he rose up. It has been taught in the name of R. Nathan: A garment which goes down to the grave with a person is going to rise on him in the resurrection of the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1299">13</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Job 38:14): <small>IT IS CHANGED LIKE CLAY UNDER A SEAL, AND THEY STAND FORTH AS IN A GARMENT</small>. (I Sam. 28:14&#x2013;15:) <small>THEN SAUL KNEW THAT IT WAS SAMUEL; SO HE BOWED WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND AND DID HOMAGE. SAMUEL SAID UNTO SAUL: WHY HAVE YOU DISTURBED ME AND BROUGHT ME UP</small>? Have you no way to disturb your creator except through me, in that you have made me an idol.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">14</xref></sup> Did we not teach the following? Just as one exacts punishment from the worshiper, so does one exact punishment from those worshiped. Some say: <small>WHY HAVE YOU DISTURBED ME</small>? What he said to him was: I was disturbed lest it be the day of judgment, and I was afraid. Now here is an argument a fortiori (<italic>qal wahomer</italic>); for if Samuel, [the greatest] of all the prophets, was afraid of the day of judgment, how much the more does the rest of humanity &#x003C; have to fear &#x003E;? (Vs. 15, cont.:) <small>AND SAUL SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO SAMUEL</small>&#x007D;: <small>I AM VERY DISTRESSED</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">15</xref></sup> [<small>HE</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>NO LONGER ANSWERS ME EITHER THROUGH PROPHETS OR IN DREAMS</small>.] Why did he not &#x003C; also &#x003E; say to him: &#x201C;&#x003C; Or &#x003E; by Urim and Thummim&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn1302">16</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: (Prov. 14:10:) <small>THE HEART KNOWS ITS OWN BITTERNESS</small>, in that he had destroyed Nob, the city of priests.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">17</xref></sup> (I Sam. 28:17:) <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD HAS DONE TO YOU</small><sup><xref rid="fn1304">18</xref></sup> <small>ACCORDING TO WHAT HE SPOKE THROUGH ME; FOR THE LORD HAS TORN THE KINGSHIP OUT OF YOUR HAND AND GIVEN IT TO DAVID</small>. He said to him: [When you were with us &#x003C; in the flesh &#x003E;, you said to me (in I Sam. 15:28): <small>&#x003C; THE LORD HAS TORN THE KINGSHIP OVER ISRAEL FROM YOU TODAY, &#x003E; AND GIVEN IT TO A COMPANION OF YOURS WHO IS BETTER THAN YOU</small>. He said to him:] When I was with you in the world of falsehood, I was telling you words of falsehood, because I was afraid of you, lest you kill me. Now, however, I am in the world of truth, you will only hear words of truth from me. He did not do this thing to you for no reason. Rather (according to I Sam. 28:18&#x2013;19): <small>BECAUSE YOU DID NOT HEARKEN TO THE VOICE OF THE LORD, AND DID NOT CARRY OUT HIS WRATH AGAINST AMALEK</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD WILL DELIVER ISRAEL ALONG WITH YOU INTO THE HAND OF THE PHILISTINES; AND TOMORROW YOU AND YOUR SONS WILL BE WITH ME. WITH ME</small> &#x003C; means &#x003E;: In my section &#x003C; of heaven &#x003E;. When he heard this, (according to vs. 20): <small>IMMEDIATELY SAUL FELL FULL LENGTH TO THE GROUND, FOR HE WAS TERRIFIED BECAUSE OF SAMUEL&#x2019;S WORDS</small>. Abner and Amasa said to him: What did Samuel say to you? He said to them: He said to me: Tomorrow you will go down to battle and be victorious. In addition, your sons will be appointed their superiors. Resh Laqish said: At that time the Holy One called the ministering angels. He said to them: Come and see the creature that I have created in my world. By universal custom when one goes to a banquet house, he does not take his children with him for fear of the evil eye; but this one, when he is going down to battle and knows that he will be killed, takes his sons with him, and is happy over the divine justice that is striking him.<sup><xref rid="fn1305">19</xref></sup> R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: &#x003C; Lev. 21:1: <small>SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>. These words &#x003E; teach that the Holy One showed Moses every generation and its expositors, every generation and its judges, every generation and its kings; and he showed him Saul and his sons falling by the sword.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">20</xref></sup> He said to him: Sovereign of the World, will the first king to stand over your children be pierced by the sword? He said to him: Moses, &#x003C; why &#x003E; are you telling me? Tell the priests whom he killed. &#x003C; They are the ones &#x003E; who are denouncing<sup><xref rid="fn1307">21</xref></sup> him. Our masters have taught: That righteous man (i.e., Saul) was killed for five sins. Thus it is stated (in I Chron. 10:13): <small>SO SAUL DIED FOR HIS TRANSGRESSION WHICH HE COMMITTED AGAINST THE LORD</small>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because he had destroyed Nob, the city of priests;</li>
<li>Because he had spared Agag;</li>
<li>Because he had not hearkened to Samuel, as stated (in I Sam. 10:8): <small>WAIT SEVEN DAYS</small> &#x2026;, since he did not do so; but (according to I Sam. 13:12): <small>AND I FORCED MYSELF TO OFFER THE BURNT OFFERING</small>;</li>
<li>Also when he inquired through a ghost, as stated (in I Chron. 10:13, cont.): <small>AND ALSO BECAUSE HE INQUIRED FOR COUNSEL THROUGH A GHOST</small>; and</li>
<li>(I Chron. 10:14:) <small>BUT HE DID NOT INQUIRE THROUGH THE LORD</small>.</li>
</ol>
<title>8.5 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: SAY UNTO THE PRIESTS &#x003C;</small> &#x2026;, <small>AND SAY UNTO THEM &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1308">22</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: Wherever it says: <small>SAY</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;, &#x003E; <small>AND SAY</small>, it must be interpreted.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">23</xref></sup> (Esth. 7:5:) <small>THEN SAID KING AHASUERUS, AND HE SAID TO QUEEN ESTHER</small>. Why <small>SAID</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND HE SAID</small>? He said to her; If this (Haman) is the man, well and good; but if not, they have said that he is.<sup><xref rid="fn1310">24</xref></sup> R. Abbin said: Before &#x003C; the king &#x003E; came to know about her being Jewish, he talked with her through an interpreter; when he came to know about her, he began to talk with her by himself. Similarly (in I Kings 20:28): <small>THEN THE MAN OF GOD SAID UNTO</small> &#x007B;<small>AHAB</small>&#x007D; <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL, AND SAID: THUS SAYS THE LORD</small>. Why <small>SAID</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;, &#x003E; <small>AND SAID</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1311">25</xref></sup> He was saying to him (with the first <small>SAID</small>): When Ben-hadad falls into your hand, you shall not take pity on him. A second saying: He said to him: Be aware of how many nets and enticements I set out for him before he comes into your hand. So now, if he is missing, (according to vs. 42) <small>IT WILL BE YOUR LIFE FOR HIS LIFE AND YOUR PEOPLE FOR HIS PEOPLE</small>. [Similarly] (in Ezek. 10:2): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO THE PERSON CLOTHED IN LINEN, AND SAID: GO IN AMONG THE WHEEL WORK, &#x003C; UNDER THE CHERUB &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; The Holy One &#x003E; said unto the angel, and the angel said to the cherub. He said to him: The Holy One has commanded me, but I do not have the authority to enter your section &#x003C; of heaven &#x003E;; so do me a favor and give me two burning coals. Immediately (in vs. 7), <small>HE TOOK SOME AND PUT THEM INTO THE HANDS OF THE ONE WHO WAS CLOTHED IN LINEN</small>. R. Pinhas said: He cooled them and gave them to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1312">26</xref></sup> R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Two burning coals were being quenched in Gabriel&#x2019;s hand for two years and a half. He was thinking that Israel would repent. When they did not do so, he sought to hurl them and destroy them. The Holy One said to him: Gabriel, do not act. There are among the children of Adam those who are repenting and doing acts of righteousness with each other. Thus it is stated (in vs. 8): <small>AND THERE THE CHERUBIM APPEARED TO HAVE THE FORM OF A HUMAN HAND</small><sup><xref rid="fn1313">27</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C; UNDER THEIR WINGS &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in vs. 2): <small>SAID</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;, &#x003E; <small>AND SAID</small>. So also here (in Lev. 21:1:) <small>SAY UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>&#x2026;, <small>AND SAY</small>. The first saying is for the unclaimed corpse, for which &#x003C; a priest &#x003E; may become unclean; and the second is for other &#x003C; corpses &#x003E;, for which he may not become unclean.</p>
<title>8.6 Leviticus 21:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>[(Lev. 21:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES: SAY UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>.] What is written after this passage (in vs. 10)? <small>AND THE PRIEST THAT IS HIGHEST AMONG HIS BROTHERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">28</xref></sup> Why is he called by the name <small>HIGH</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1315">29</xref></sup> Because he was highest (literally: greatest) in five areas: In beauty, in strength, in wealth, in wisdom, and in age.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">30</xref></sup> In regard to beauty, because he was more handsome than his brothers. In regard to strength, because he was heroic in strength. Come and consider Aaron. When he waved the Levites (as in a wave offering), he waved twenty-two thousand in one day. How did he wave them? Back and forth, up and down. Ergo: He was highest in strength. Also in regard to wealth, because if he had not been wealthy, his brother priests would have made him wealthy. There is a story about Pinhas the Stone Cutter. When they appointed him high priest, his brother priests went out and saw him cutting stone. So they would not permit him to continue, but filled the quarry before him with gold dinars.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">31</xref></sup> [And where is it shown] that, if he had nothing, his brother high priests would magnify (rt.: <italic><small>GDL</small></italic>) him? Where it is stated (in an alternate translation of Lev. 21:10): <small>AND THE PRIEST THAT IS HIGHEST</small> (rt.: <italic><small>GDL</small></italic>) <small>BECAUSE OF HIS BROTHERS</small>. And &#x003C; this rule applies &#x003E; not to the high priest alone, but to the king as well. And so you find in the case of David, when he went to fight with Goliath the Philistine, Saul said to him (in I Sam. 17:33): <small>YOU CANNOT GO UNTO &#x003C; THIS &#x003E; PHILISTINE</small> &#x2026; David said to him (in vs. 34&#x2013;36): <small>YOUR SERVANT TENDED HIS</small> [<small>FATHER&#x2019;S</small>] <small>SHEEP</small>; &#x003C; <small>AND WHEN A LION OR A BEAR CAME AND CARRIED OFF A LAMB FROM THE FLOCK, &#x003E; I WOULD GO OUT AFTER IT, SMITE IT, &#x003C; AND DELIVER IT OUT OF ITS MOUTH &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; YOUR SERVANT &#x003E; SMOTE BOTH THE LION AND THE BEAR</small>, <small>&#x003C; AND THIS UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE SHALL BE AS ONE OF THEM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Saul said to him: And who told you that you could slay him? David replied: Hunting<sup><xref rid="fn1318">32</xref></sup> has trained me, Papa. (Vs. 37:) <small>THE LORD WHO DELIVERED FROM THE PAW OF THE LION</small>&#x2026; <small>&#x003C; WILL DELIVER ME FROM THE HAND OF THIS PHILISTINE &#x003E;</small>. Immediately (we read in vs. 38): <small>SAUL CLOTHED DAVID WITH HIS MILITARY GARMENTS</small>&#x2026;. Now it is written (in I Sam. 9:2): <small>HE WAS A HEAD TALLER</small><sup><xref rid="fn1319">33</xref></sup> <small>THAN ANY OF THE PEOPLE</small>. When he had clothed him in his garments and seen that they were made for him, he immediately cast a jaundiced eye at him. When David saw that he had offended Saul, he said to him (in I Sam. 17:39): <small>I CANNOT</small> &#x007B;<small>GO FORTH</small>&#x007D; [<small>GO</small>] <small>IN THESE, FOR I AM NOT USED TO THEM</small>. Here you learn that even though a person may be short, when he is appointed king, he becomes tall. Why? Because as soon as he is anointed with the anointing oil, he becomes superior to his brothers. David said: I rejoiced over the anointing oil with which I was anointed, in that I shall never move away from my glory. It is so stated (in Ps. 16:9): <small>SO MY HEART REJOICES, AND MY GLORY EXALTS; MY FLESH ALSO DWELLS IN SAFETY</small>.</p>
<title>8.7 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 22:27:) <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT IS BORN</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1320">34</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C; YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. <small>&#x003E;</small> These are the righteous ones, in that they have been compared with mountains, where it is stated (in Micah 6:2): <small>HEAR, O MOUNTAINS, THE LAWSUIT OF THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. (Ps. 36:7 [6], cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked, since it is stated (in Ps. 136:15): <small>BUT OVERTHREW PHARAOH AND HIS HOST IN THE REED SEA</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. These are the righteous. Just as these mountains grow herbs, so the righteous possess good works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked. Just as the deep does not grow herbs, so the wicked do not possess good works.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Just as the mountains are suitable for sowing and producing fruit; so do the righteous produce fruit, in that they do good for themselves and do good for others.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">35</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Is. 3:10): <small>TELL THE RIGHTEOUS THAT &#x003C; ALL IS &#x003E; WELL FOR THEM, FOR THEY SHALL EAT THE FRUIT OF THEIR WORKS</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a gold bell with a pearl<sup><xref rid="fn1322">36</xref></sup> clapper. Similarly the righteous do good for themselves and do good for others. (Ps. 36:7 [6] cont.:) <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. These are the wicked. Just as the deep is unable to sow and grow fruit, so the wicked to not possess good works. Instead they are distressing for themselves and for others.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS &#x003C; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &#x003E;</small>. Transpose the text and interpret it.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">37</xref></sup> &#x201C;Your righteousness over your judgments is like the mighty mountains over the great deep.&#x201D; Thus it is stated (in Ps. 48:11 [10]): <small>YOUR RIGHT HAND IS FULL OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 32:41): <small>MY HAND LAYS HOLD ON RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. Just as these mountains hold down the deep, so that it does not rise up and inundate the earth, so the works of the righteous hold back the divine retributions, so that they will not come into the world.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Just as these mountains have no end, so there is no end to the reward of the righteous in the world to come. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. Just as the deep has no limit, so there is no limit to the divine retributions of the wicked in the world to come.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> (literally: <small>MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>); <small>&#x003C; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &#x003E;</small>. R. Ishmael and R. Aqiva &#x003C; differ &#x003E; &#x007B;say&#x007D;: [R. Ishmael says:] Since the righteous (rt.: <italic><small>TsDQ</small></italic>) carry out the Torah, which was given from <small>THE MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>, [the Holy One treats them with a charity (rt.: <italic><small>TsDQ</small></italic>) <small>LIKE THE MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>. But since the wicked do not carry out the Torah, which was given from <small>THE MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>,] the Holy One deals strictly with them, even unto the great deep. There are a lot of interpretations for this verse, but in order not to be tiresome, &#x003C; I am stopping here &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1324">38</xref></sup> [R. Aqiva says: The Holy One is as strict with the former as with the latter. From the righteous he collects for a few evil works which they have committed in this world, in order to render them full payment in the world to come; while he gives prosperity in abundance to the wicked and pays them for the few good works that they have done in this world, in order to punish them in the world to come. Rabbi Meir says: &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; has spoken metaphorically of the righteous in their abode, and it has spoken metaphorically of the wicked in their abode.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">39</xref></sup> It has spoken metaphorically of the righteous in their abode, even as stated (in Ezek. 34:14): <small>I WILL FEED THEM IN A GOOD PASTURE, AND UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF THE LOFTY ONE OF ISRAEL SHALL BE THEIR FOLD</small>. And it has spoken metaphorically of the wicked in their abode, as stated (in Ezek. 31:15): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD: IN THE DAY THAT HE WENT DOWN TO SHEOL, I CAUSED HIM TO MOURN</small> (<italic>he&#x2019;evalti);</italic> <small>I COVERED HIM WITH THE DEEP</small>. The Written Text is &#x201C;I led&#x201D; (<italic>hovalti</italic>) (not <small>I CAUSED</small>&#x2026; <small>TO MOURN</small> [<italic>he&#x2019;evalti</italic>]).<sup><xref rid="fn1326">40</xref></sup> R. Judah bar Ammi told a parable: One does not make a cover for a vat of silver, gold, bronze, iron, [or of lead], but of clay, because that is a material of the same sort. Similarly, the Holy One said: Gehinnom is darkness, as stated (in Ps. 35:6): <small>LET THEIR PATH BE DARKNESS AND SLIPPERINESS, WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD PURSUING THEM</small>. Moreover, the deep is darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>. And the wicked are darkness, as stated (in Is. 29:15): <small>FOR THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS; SO THEY SAY: WHO SEES US? AND WHO KNOWS ABOUT US</small>? So let darkness come and cover darkness, just as you have said (in Eccl. 6:4): <small>FOR IT COMES IN VANITY AND GOES IN DARKNESS; EVEN ITS NAME IS COVERED IN DARKNESS</small>.]</p>
<title>8.8 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; &#x003C; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP &#x003E;</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said: The righteous act which you did with Noah in the ark was <small>LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">41</xref></sup> [Thus it is stated] (in Gen. 8:4): <small>AND THE ARK CAME TO REST IN THE SEVENTH MONTH, ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH, UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF ARARAT</small>. And the <small>JUDGMENTS</small> are those which you rendered with his generation and carried out strictly with them as far as <small>THE GREAT DEEP</small>. [Thus it is stated] (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY ALL THE SPRINGS OF THE GREAT DEEP BURST FORTH</small>. Moreover, when you remembered him, you did not remember him alone, as stated (in Gen. 8:1): <small>THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH, ALL THE BEASTS, AND ALL THE CATTLE</small>.</p>
<p>When R. Joshua ben Levi went away to Rome, he saw there two marble columns covered with bedding<sup><xref rid="fn1328">42</xref></sup> so that they would neither be cracked in the burning heat nor frozen in the cold.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">43</xref></sup> He &#x003C; also &#x003E; saw there a certain pauper with a reed mat under him and a reed mat over him. With reference to the columns, he read (Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</small> (i.e., your charity) <small>IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small>. Indeed, when you give, you bestow abundantly. But with reference to the pauper, he read (ibid., cont.): <small>AND YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. [Indeed,] when you are protesting, you deal strictly.</p>
<title>8.9 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part III</title>
<p>Alexander of Macedon went off [to the king of Qatsia] beyond the Mountains of Darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">44</xref></sup> He arrived at the province named Carthage, which was entirely &#x003C; inhabited by &#x003E; &#x007B;strange things&#x007D; [women]. They came out to meet him. They said to him: If you wage war with us and are victorious against us, your name will go forth in the world as one who destroyed [a province of] women; but if we wage war with you and conquer you, your name will go forth in the world for having women wage war with you and conquer you. Then you will never again stand up to &#x003C; another &#x003E; kingdom. When he went away, he wrote over the entrance<sup><xref rid="fn1331">45</xref></sup> gate: I, King Alexander of Macedon, was a fool until I came to the province of Carthage and learned &#x003C; to take &#x003E; counsel from women. He went to another province named Africa. They came out to meet him [with golden apples], with golden pomegranates, and with golden bread. He said to them: Is gold eaten in your land? They said to him: &#x007B;Did you not have anything to eat&#x007D; [Was it not like this for you] in your own country, why did you come to us?<sup><xref rid="fn1332">46</xref></sup> He said to them: I have not come to see your wealth. Rather I have come to see your laws. While they were sitting &#x003C; there &#x003E;, two men came before the king for judgment. One said: Your majesty, I bought a deserted building from this man; and when I cleaned it out, I found a treasure in it. So I said to him: Take your treasure, because I &#x003C; only &#x003E; bought a deserted building. I did not buy a treasure. But the other said: Just as you are afraid of a punishment for robbery, so likewise am I afraid of punishment for robbery; for when I sold you the deserted building, I sold you whatever was in it from under the ground up to the heavens. The king summoned one of them. He said to him: Do you have a son? He said: &#x003C; Yes, &#x003E; I do. He called the other one. He said to him: Do you have a daughter? He told him: Yes. &#x003C; The king &#x003E; said to them: &#x007B;So let them marry&#x007D; [Let them go and marry] one another. Then both of them will use up the treasure. Now Alexander began to be amazed. The king said to him: What reason do you have to be amazed? For did I not judge well? He told him: Yes. He said to him: If this case had arisen in your land, what would you have done about it? He said to him: We would have killed this one and the other one. Then the treasure would go to the house of the king. He said to him: But does the sun shine upon you? He told him: Yes. And does the rain come down upon you? He told him: Yes. Are there perhaps &#x003C; some &#x003E; small cattle in your land? He told him: Yes. He said to him: Woe to that man&#x0021; It is for the sake of small cattle that the sun shines for you and that the rain comes down upon you. [So it for the sake of the small cattle that you are saved.] Thus it is written (in Ps. 36:7 [6], cont.): <small>HUMAN AND CATTLE YOU SAVE, O LORD</small>. For the sake of the small cattle you are saved.</p>
<p>Israel said: Sovereign of the World, we are human, but you shall save us as cattle,<sup><xref rid="fn1333">47</xref></sup> because we are drawn after you like cattle, as stated (in Cant. 1:4): <small>DRAW ME AFTER YOU</small>. Where are we drawn after you? To the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Ps. 36:9 [8]): <small>THEY FEAST ON THE ABUNDANCE OF YOUR HOUSE, AND YOU HAVE THEM DRINK AT THE RIVER OF YOUR EDENS</small>. R. Eleazar bar Menahem said: &#x201C;Your Eden&#x201D; (in the singular) is not written here, but <small>YOUR EDENS</small>, because each and every righteous person has a section in Eden for himself. (Ps. 36:7 [6]:) <small>HUMAN AND CATTLE YOU SAVE, O LORD</small>. R. Isaac said: An ordinance for humanity and an ordinance for cattle [are on a par].<sup><xref rid="fn1334">48</xref></sup> An ordinance for humanity is (Lev. 12:3): <small>AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED</small>. And an ordinance for cattle is (Lev. 22:27): <small>AND FROM THE EIGHTH DAY ON IT SHALL BE ACCEPTABLE</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.10 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part IV</title>
<p>R. Tanhuma opened &#x003C; his discourse &#x003E; (with Job 41:3 [11]): <small>WHO HAS ADVANCED ME ANYTHING? I SHALL REPAY HIM. EVERYTHING UNDER THE HEAVENS IS MINE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">49</xref></sup> This refers to a bachelor who dwells in a province and gives an allowance to Bible and Mishnah teachers.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">50</xref></sup> The Holy One said: It is for me to pay him the compensation of a male child. R. Jeremiah bar Eleazar said: There is going to be a heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) that shall explode on the tops of the mountains and say: Whoever has done &#x003C; something &#x003E; along with God, let him come and receive his reward. [This is what is written (in Numb. 23:23): <small>NOW</small> (in the age to come) <small>IT IS SAID FOR JACOB AND FOR ISRAEL: WHAT HAS GOD DONE</small>?] The Holy Spirit also proclaims (in Job 41:3 [11]): <small>WHO HAS ADVANCED ME ANYTHING? I WILL REPAY HIM</small>. Who offered me praise<sup><xref rid="fn1337">51</xref></sup> before I gave him breath? Who has performed circumcision for me before I gave him a male child? Who made a tassel for me before I gave him a prayer shawl? Who made a parapet (in accord with Deut. 22:8) for me [before I gave him a roof? Who made a mezuzah] before I gave him a house? Who made a sukkah for me before I gave him room? Who set aside <italic>pe&#x2019;ah</italic> before I gave him a field? Who set aside grain offering and tithe before I gave him a threshing floor? Who set aside first fruits, tithes, and sacrifice before I gave him cattle?

<title>8.11 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part V</title>
<p>R. Jacob bar Zavday in the name of R. Abbahu opened &#x003C; his discourse &#x003E; (with Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small> (i.e., the iniquity of the golden calf).<sup><xref rid="fn1338">52</xref></sup> It is also written (in Is. 6:2): <small>ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM</small>&#x2026;.<small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FACE</small>, so as not to look at the Divine Presence, <small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET</small>, so that the face of the Divine Presence would not see them, since it is written (in Ezek. 1:7): <small>AND THE SOLE OF THEIR FEET WAS LIKE THE SOLE OF A CALF&#x2019;S FOOT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1339">53</xref></sup> Thus (according to Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>We are taught there (in <small><italic>RH</italic></small> 3:2): <small>ALL THE SHOPHARS ARE VALID EXCEPT THAT OF A COW</small>, since it is from a calf; for (according to Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small>. We have been taught there:<sup><xref rid="fn1341">55</xref></sup> (Lev. 20:16): <small>YOU SHALL KILL THE WOMAN AND THE BEAST</small>. If a woman sins with a beast, how does it sin? It is simply because a stumbling block came to the woman on account of &#x003C; the beast &#x003E;. Therefore (in vs. 15): <small>AND YOU SHALL KILL THE BEAST</small>. &#x007B;Another interpretation:&#x007D; So that the beast will not pass through the market, where they will say: This is the beast on account of which such and such a woman was killed. And this is &#x003C; why it is written &#x003E; (in Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small>. Now we have been taught in a baraita: For what reason did they say: A suspected adulteress (<italic>sotah</italic>) is not to drink from the cup of her colleague (i.e., another suspected adulteress)?<sup><xref rid="fn1342">56</xref></sup> &#x003C; It is &#x003E; so that the people will not say: When such and such a woman drank of this cup, she died. And this is &#x003C; why it is written &#x003E; (in Ezek. 29:16): <small>AND IT SHALL NO MORE BE A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL TO RECALL INIQUITY</small>. So also here (in Lev. 22:27): <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT &#x003C; IS BORN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YLD</small></italic>)&#x2026; <small>&#x003E;</small>. Was a bull brought forth (rt.: <italic><small>YLD</small></italic>)? Was not a &#x003C; golden &#x003E; calf brought forth (rt.: <italic><small>YLD</small></italic>)? It is simply because of what is written (in Exod. 32:8): <small>THEY HAVE MADE THEMSELVES A GOLDEN CALF</small>. Ergo: <small>BULL</small> is written, and &#x201C;calf&#x201D; is not written. [This is what is written] (in Lev. 22:27): <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT &#x003C; IS BORN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YLD</small></italic>)&#x2026; <small>&#x003E;</small></p>

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THAT WHICH IS TO BE HAS ALREADY HAPPENED</small>. If someone says to you that the Holy One will be raising the dead, say to him: Look, he has already done so through Elijah, through Elisha, and through Ezekiel. [But Rabbi Nehemiah says: If someone says to you that the Holy One is going to make the sea into dry ground, say to him: He has already done so in the days of Moses, as stated (in Exod. 14:29): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT THROUGH THE SEA ON DRY GROUND, AND THE WATERS WERE A WALL FOR THEM TO THE RIGHT AND TO THE LEFT</small>.] Moreover, R. Aha said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahman: Everything that the Holy One is going to do in the world to come he has already anticipated and partly done at the hands of the righteous in this world. The Holy One said: I am going to raise the dead. I have already done so at the hands of Elijah, at the hands of Elisha, and at the hands of Ezekiel. The Holy One said: I am going to make the sea into dry ground. I have already done so (ibid.): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WENT THROUGH THE SEA ON DRY GROUND</small>. The Holy One said: I am going to open the eyes of the blind. It has already happened, as stated (in II Kings 6:17): <small>&#x003C; THEN ELISHA PRAYED AND SAID: LORD, PLEASE OPEN HIS EYES AND LET HIM SEE</small>. &#x003E; <small>SO THE LORD OPENED THE EYES OF THE SERVANT &#x003C; AND HE SAW &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: I am going visit barren women. It has already happened, as stated (in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: [I am going to make kings bow down to you, as stated] (in Is. 49:23): <small>KINGS SHALL BE YOUR GUARDIANS</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003C; THEY SHALL BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU, NOSE TO THE GROUND, AND LICK THE DUST OF YOUR FEET</small>. &#x003E; It has already happened at the hands of Daniel, when Nebuchadnezzar bowed down to Daniel, as stated (in Dan. 2:46): <small>&#x003C; THEN KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FELL ON HIS FACE, &#x003E; PAID HOMAGE TO DANIEL, &#x003C; AND SAID</small>&#x2026; <small>&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Eccl. 3:15:) <small>THEN GOD SEEKS THE PERSECUTED</small>. R. Huna said in the name of R. Joseph: The Holy One is going to claim the blood of the persecuted from the hand of those who persecute them.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">58</xref></sup> When a righteous person persecutes a righteous person, <small>GOD SEEKS THE PERSECUTED</small>.

Even if you come back and say: When a righteous person persecutes a wicked person, in every case, <small>THEN GOD SEEKS THE PERSECUTED</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn1345">59</xref></sup> You know that this is so. Note that Abel was persecuted by Cain; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 4:4): <small>AND THE LORD PAID HEED UNTO ABEL AND UNTO HIS OFFERING</small>. Noah was persecuted by his generation, <small>BUT</small> (according to Gen. 6:8): <small>NOAH FOUND FAVOR &#x003C; IN THE EYES OF THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. As for his generation, (cf. Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT ALL EXISTENCE</small>. Abraham was persecuted by Nimrod; (cf. Neh. 9:7:) <small>YOU ARE THE LORD, THE GOD WHO CHOSE ABRAHAM</small>. Isaac was persecuted by Philistines; (cf. Gen. 26:28:) <small>AND THEY SAID: WE SEE PLAINLY &#x003C; THAT THE LORD HAS BEEN WITH YOU &#x003E;</small>. Jacob was persecuted by Esau; (cf. Ps. 135:4:) <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN JACOB FOR HIMSELF</small>. Joseph was persecuted by his brothers; (cf. Gen. 39:2:) <small>AND THE LORD WAS WITH JOSEPH</small>. Moses was persecuted by Pharaoh; (cf. Ps. 106:23:) <small>THEREFORE HE SAID HE WOULD DESTROY THEM, HAD NOT MOSES HIS CHOSEN</small> <small>&#x003C; STOOD IN THE BREACH BEFORE HIM &#x003E;</small>. Israel is being persecuted by the nations of the world; (cf. Deut. 7:6:) <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said in the name of R. [Jose bar] Nehoray. Here also (in the case of sacrificial animals) the bull is persecuted by the lion; the sheep is persecuted by the wolf; the goat is persecuted by the leopard. The Holy One said: You shall not bring me a sacrifice from the persecutor but from the persecuted. Thus it is stated (Lev. 22:27): <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT</small>&#x2026;.</p>

<p>[Another interpretation of (Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP &#x003C; OR A GOAT &#x003E;</small>. This text is related] (to Micah 6:3): <small>MY PEOPLE, WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU? AND HOW HAVE I WEARIED YOU? TESTIFY AGAINST ME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">60</xref></sup> R. Aha said: <small>TESTIFY AGAINST ME</small> (i.e., prove me wrong by keeping the commandments), and receive a reward. (Exod. 20:13 [16]): <small>DO NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>, and you will receive settlement of accounts. R. Samuel bar Nahman said: On three occasions the Holy One came to dispute with Israel, when the nations of the world rejoiced and said: How can these people dispute with their creator? Now he will finish them off. At that time, when he said to them (in Is. 1:18): <small>PLEASE COME AND LET US DISPUTE TOGETHER</small>, they rejoiced and said: Now he will finish them off. When the Holy One saw that they were rejoicing, he reversed &#x003C; the punishment &#x003E; for the better. He said (ibid.): <small>THOUGH YOUR SINS BE AS SCARLET, &#x003C; THEY SHALL BECOME AS WHITE &#x003E; AS SNOW</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; When the nations of the world heard this, they were astonished and said: Is this an answer? Or is this a rebuke? They said: He has only come to amuse himself with his children (and not to dispute with them seriously). The second &#x003C; occasion &#x003E; was when he said to them (in Micah 6:2): <small>HEAR, O MOUNTAINS, THE LAWSUIT OF THE LORD</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;; &#x003E; [<small>FOR THE LORD HAS A LAWSUIT WITH HIS PEOPLE, AND HE WILL DISPUTE WITH ISRAEL</small>]. The nations of the world rejoiced and said: Now he will finish them off. When the Holy One saw that, he reversed &#x003C; the punishment &#x003E; for the better and said (in Micah 6:5&#x2013;6): <small>MY PEOPLE, PLEASE REMEMBER WHAT KING BALAK OF MOAB PLOTTED</small>&#x2026;. <small>WITH WHAT SHALL I COME BEFORE THE LORD</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1347">61</xref></sup> The nations of the world were astonished and said: Is this an answer? Or is this a rebuke? He has only come to amuse himself with his children. The third &#x003C; occasion &#x003E; was when he said (in Hos. 12:3 [2]): <small>THE LORD HAS A LAWSUIT WITH JUDAH</small> [<small>AND WILL PUNISH JACOB ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS</small>]. The nations of the world said: Now the Holy One will finish them off. When the Holy One saw that, he reversed &#x003C; the punishment &#x003E; for the better. (Hos. 12:4 [3]:) <small>IN THE WOMB HE GRABBED HIS BROTHER BY THE HEEL</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is similar to a woman who complained to the judge about her son. When she &#x007B;decided&#x007D; [saw] that the judge was sentencing &#x007B;her&#x007D; [the] people to death, [she said]: If I make known the offense of my son, he will say to kill him. What did she do? She hung around [until] he had finished his cases. He said to her? What was your son&#x2019;s offense? She said to him: When he was in my womb, he kicked me. He said to her: But has he done anything to you now? She said: No. He said to her. Be gone&#x0021; There is no legal offense at all. The nations of the world were astonished [and said]: He has &#x007B;not&#x007D; [only] come to amuse himself with his children.</p>
<p>(Micah 6:3): <small>AND HOW HAVE I WEARIED YOU</small>? &#x2026;. [R. Berekhyah said:] &#x003C; The situation &#x003E; is similar to a king who sent his proclamation<sup><xref rid="fn1348">62</xref></sup> to a province. What did the people of the province do? When they received it, they [stood upon their feet,] uncovered their heads, and read it in fear, in awe, and in trembling. The Holy One said to Israel: The reading of the Shema is my proclamation. I did not burden you, and I did not tell you that you were to read it either standing upon your feet or with your heads uncovered, but (according to Deut. 6:7) <small>WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE, WHEN YOU ARE WALKING ON THE ROAD, WHEN YOU ARE LYING DOWN, AND WHEN YOU ARE GETTING UP</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Micah 6:3): <small>AND HOW HAVE I WEARIED YOU</small>? R. Judah bar Simon said: I have delivered ten &#x003C; kinds of &#x003E; beasts to you (for food).<sup><xref rid="fn1349">63</xref></sup> Three are under your control, and seven are not under to your control. Now these are those which are under your control (according to Deut. 14:4): <small>THE BULL, THE SHEEP, AND THE GOAT</small>. And these are those which are not under your control (according to Deut. 14:5): <small>THE DEER, THE GAZELLE, THE ROEBUCK, THE WILD GOAT, THE IBEX, THE ANTELOPE, AND THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP</small>. I did not burden you, nor did I tell you to go up into the mountains or tire yourselves out in the fields in order to bring me a sacrifice from those [which are not under your control]. Rather &#x003C; your sacrifices come &#x003E; from those which are under your control, which grew up at your feeding trough. This is what is written (in Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP &#x003C; OR A GOAT &#x003E;</small>.</p>

<p>[Another interpretation of (Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT</small>.

The king looked into the rumors and found no substance in them. What did the king do? He made a great banquet and sat him at the head of those reclining in order to show that the king had looked into the rumors and found no substance in them. [Similarly, because the nations of the world were saying to Israel: You made the calf, the Holy One examined the rumors and found no substance in them.] Therefore [the bull] was made first among the sacrifices. [Thus it is written] (in Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT</small>.</p>
<p>R. Huna and R. Idi &#x003C; said &#x003E; in the name of R.

<p>[Another interpretation of (Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP &#x003C; OR A GOAT &#x003E;</small>. The <small>BULL</small> was due to the merit of Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 18:7): <small>THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD</small> (for a calf to feed his heavenly visitors).<sup><xref rid="fn1354">68</xref></sup> The <small>SHEEP</small> was due to the merit of Isaac, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 22:13): <small>AND THERE WAS A RAM</small> (to replace an obedient Isaac as a sacrifice).

<p>[Another interpretation] (of Prov. 12:10): <small>A RIGHTEOUS ONE REGARDS &#x003C; THE LIFE OF HIS CATTLE &#x003E;</small>.

Did he not know that his brother would be fruitful and multiply during his father&#x2019;s lifetime? I will not act like that. Instead, while they are tiny under their mothers&#x2019; birthstool, I will strangle them. Thus it is written (in Exod. 1:22): <small>EVERY SON BORN YOU SHALL THROW INTO THE NILE</small> &#x2026; Haman said: Pharaoh was stupid to say: <small>EVERY SON BORN &#x003C; YOU SHALL THROW INTO THE NILE &#x003E;</small>, [<small>BUT EVERY DAUGHTER YOU SHALL KEEP ALIVE</small>]. Did he not know that, when the daughters are married to men, they are fruitful and multiply through them. I will not act like that.

Did they not know that they have a patron<sup><xref rid="fn1367">81</xref></sup> in the heavens? I will not act like that. First I will join in battle with their patron, and after that I will join in battle with them. Thus it is written (in Ps. 2:2): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH TAKE THEIR STAND, AND THE RULERS TAKE COUNSEL TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD AND AGAINST HIS ANOINTED</small>. The Holy One said to him: O wicked one, have you come to me to join in battle?<sup><xref rid="fn1368">82</xref></sup> By your life I will wage war with you, as stated (in Is. 42:13): <small>THE LORD SHALL GO FORTH LIKE A WARRIOR</small>&#x2026;.

After all, this word (<italic>ya&#x2018;arokh</italic>) can only be a word concerning sustenance, since it is stated (in Lev. 24:8): <small>ON &#x003C; EVERY &#x003E; SABBATH DAY HE SHALL &#x003C; REGULARLY &#x003E; ARRANGE</small> (<italic>ya&#x2018;arokh</italic> with a suffix) <small>IT</small> (i.e., the bread) <small>&#x003C; BEFORE THE LORD &#x003E;</small>.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>? Who is like unto the Holy One in clothing the naked? After all, this word (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) can only be a word denoting a garment, since it is stated (in Jud. 17:10): <small>A SUIT</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>OF CLOTHES AND</small> &#x007B;<small>THEIR</small>&#x007D; [<small>YOUR</small>] <small>MAINTENANCE</small>.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Ps.89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? If your &#x003C; evil &#x003E; drive comes and says to you: Who sacrificed to the Holy One before the world was created?<sup><xref rid="fn1372">86</xref></sup> [you shall say to him:] Consider that Moses ascended to the sky and spent a hundred and twenty days there.

He neither ate nor drank, [as stated (in Exod. 34:28): <small>AND HE WAS THERE WITH THE LORD FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS; HE NEITHER ATE BREAD NOR DRANK WATER</small>.]</p>
<p>R. Simeon ben Laqish said: If your &#x003C; evil &#x003E; drive comes to reflect and say: If there were no eating and drinking before him, he would not have told me to sacrifice and offer libations to him.

Did they offer sacrifices on Mount Sinai? &#x003C; No. &#x003E; Rather observe that it was Moses who went up onto Mount Sinai. Let him tell you whether there were food and drink before me.

<p>R. Hiyya bar Abba said: When a mighty man who is walking on the road is thirsty and goes to drink water, how much does he drink with his hands? Ten handfuls? Six handfuls? Four handfuls? Less than two he does not drink. Now all the water that is in the world would be a filling for the hollow of &#x003C; the Holy One&#x2019;s &#x003E; hand, as stated (in Is. 40:12): <small>WHO HAS MEASURED THE WATERS IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND</small>? &#x003C; It is so written &#x003E; in order to make known that for him there is no eating or drinking. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; why did he tell me to offer sacrifice? In order to benefit you.

(Eccl. 3:19): &#x007B;<small>ALL</small>&#x007D; [<small>THEY</small>] <small>HAVE THE SAME FATE</small>. Just as the human contracts uncleanness, the beast also contracts uncleanness. It is written concerning the human (in Numb. 19:11): <small>ONE WHO TOUCHES</small> &#x007B;<small>A CORPSE SHALL BE UNCLEAN</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE CORPSE OF ANY HUMAN BEING SHALL BE UNCLEAN FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>].

Concerning the human (in Lev. 20:16): <small>YOU SHALL KILL THE WOMAN</small>; and concerning the beast (in vs. 15): <small>AND YOU SHALL KILL THE BEAST</small>.

<title>8.22 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part XVI</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 22:27): <small>WHEN A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT &#x003C; IS BORN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Ps. 27:6): <small>AND NOW SHALL MY HEAD BE LIFTED UP OVER MY ENEMIES ROUND ABOUT ME</small>; [<small>I WILL OFFER SACRIFICE IN HIS TENT WITH A LOUD CRY</small>;] <small>&#x003C; I WILL SING AND CHANT PRAISE TO THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. When Israel carried out that deed (of the golden calf), the nations of the world said: [There will be no recovery for them, and he will never return to them].<sup><xref rid="fn1376">90</xref></sup> When Israel heard that they had sacrificed a bull, their head was lifted up, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND NOW SHALL MY HEAD BE LIFTED UP</small>&#x2026;.

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL OFFER SACRIFICE IN HIS TENT WITH A LOUD CRY; I WILL SING AND CHANT PRAISE TO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>8.23 Leviticus 22:26ff, Part XVII</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 22:27): <small>A BULL OR A SHEEP OR A GOAT</small>. Why did the Holy One say to sacrifice a bull. To atone for the image of the bull, as stated (in Ps. 103:3): <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. You should know this on your own. See what is written (in Ezek. 1:6): <small>EACH HAD FOUR FACES, AND EACH OF THEM HAD FOUR WINGS</small>. What is written there (in vs. 7): <small>AND THEIR LEGS BECAME A STRAIGHT LEG, AND THE SOLE OF THEIR FEET WAS LIKE THE SOLE OF A CALF&#x2019;S FOOT. Now</small> it was for the atonement of Israel that he added two [more] wings to them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 6:2): <small>&#x003C; ABOVE HIM STOOD THE SERAPHIM</small>. &#x003E; [<small>EACH</small>] <small>OF THEM HAD SIX WINGS</small>: [<small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FACE, WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET</small>,] <small>&#x003C; AND WITH TWO HE DID FLY &#x003E;</small>. Why? So that their feet would be covered, because they resembled the calf. &#x003C; It was &#x003E; so that he would not see them and recall the incident of the calf. <small>WITH TWO HE COVERED HIS FEET</small>. And why all this? Simply to atone for Israel. (Ps. 103:3:) <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. You have no larger fowl than the eagle, so it became a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10): <small>AND THE FOUR OF THEM HAD THE FACE OF AN EAGLE</small>. The largest among the beasts is the lion, so it &#x003C; also &#x003E; became a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 10:14): <small>AND THE</small> &#x007B;<small>FACE OF THE ONE</small>&#x007D; [<small>THIRD</small>] <small>WAS THE FACE OF A LION</small>. And the bull is the largest among the cattle, so that he made it a face for the living being, as stated (in Ezek. 1:10): <small>AND THE FOUR OF THEM HAD THE FACE OF A BULL</small> [<small>ON THE LEFT</small>]. &#x007B;(Ibid.:) <small>AND THE FACE OF A HUMAN</small>.&#x007D; But for the sake of Israel, the Holy One blotted out the bull and put a cherub in its place. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 10:14): <small>THE FACE OF THE ONE WAS THE FACE OF A CHERUB</small>. And why all this? To atone for Israel. Ergo, &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; says it well (in Ps. 103:3:) <small>WHO FORGIVES ALL YOUR SINS</small>. Why did the Holy One remove the calf? So that Israel would be innocent before him. And not only that, but when Israel thinks about a transgression or something evil in its heart, &#x007B;the Holy One purifies it.&#x007D; [does not the Holy One purify it?] Therefore David says (in Ps. 66:18 [17]): <small>IF I HAD PERCEIVED INIQUITY IN MY HEART, THE LORD WOULD NOT HAVE LISTENED</small>. Now what does the Holy One hear? &#x003C; What is thought &#x003E; when a person stands up to meditate in prayer. It is so stated (in vs. 19 [18]): <small>TRULY GOD HAS LISTENED; HE HAS HEARKENED TO THE SOUND OF MY PRAYER</small>. And not only that, but when two children of Adam sit and occupy themselves with the Torah, the Holy One hearkens and listens, as stated (in Mal. 3:16): <small>THEN THOSE WHO FEARED THE LORD SPOKE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THE LORD HAS HEARKENED AND LISTENED, AND A BOOK OF REMEMBRANCE HAS BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1377">91</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Through the merit of the Torah, when you occupy yourselves with it, I am hearkening and listening to your prayers; but in the world to come, before you utter a prayer before me and cry aloud before me, I will listen to your prayers. It is so stated (in Is. 65:24): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, BEFORE THEY CRY OUT, I WILL ANSWER</small>; [<small>WHILE THEY ARE YET SPEAKING, I WILL LISTEN</small>].</p>

The Holy One said: I have charged you with a lot concerning acquisitions (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) in order to benefit you.<sup><xref rid="fn1378">92</xref></sup> I told you (in Numb. 19:2): <small>&#x003C; SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003E; AND LET THEM BRING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) <small>YOU A RED COW</small>. Was it possibly for my sake? No. &#x003C; It was &#x003E; only in order to cleanse you. Is it not so written (in vs. 19): <small>AND THE CLEAN PERSON SHALL SPRINKLE IT</small> [<small>UPON THE UNCLEAN PERSON</small>]? I told you (in Exod. 25:2): <small>&#x003C; SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) <small>FOR ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>, so that I might dwell among you. It is so stated (in vs. 8): <small>AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM</small>. He, as it were, spoke a difficult thing to them: Take me that I may dwell among you. &#x201C;And take a priestly share&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>AND LET THEM TAKE</small> (<small>FOR</small>)<sup><xref rid="fn1379">93</xref></sup> <small>ME A PRIESTLY SHARE</small>. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; I, &#x003C; whom &#x003E; you are taking.

It is simply to preserve your souls, since the soul is likened to a lamp, where it is stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>A PERSON&#x2019;S BREATH IS A LAMP OF GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">94</xref></sup> And now when it says (in Lev. 23:40): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES ON THE FIRST DAY</small>, it is not because it is necessary for me, but in order to benefit you.</p>

<p>(Lev. 23:40:) <small>BEAUTIFUL TREE FRUIT, BRANCHES OF PALM TREES, BOUGHS OF DENSE TREES</small>, [<small>AND WILLOWS OF THE BROOK</small>].

These are the righteous, [because they have good works]. <small>BOUGHS OF DENSE TREES AND WILLOWS OF THE BROOK</small>. These are the average Israelites. The Holy One said: [Let them bind them together,] so that all of them become a single group, lest there be a defect among my children. If you have done so, &#x007B;I will credit them with a reward.&#x007D; [at that time I will be exalted. And so the prophet says (in Amos 9:6): <small>WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS</small>. Now when is he exalted?

<p>(Lev. 23:40:) <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES</small>. &#x003C; <small>TAKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) implies &#x003E; by purchase (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>), for you are not to persist in stealing it.<sup><xref rid="fn1382">96</xref></sup> Then it would turn out that his advocate<sup><xref rid="fn1383">97</xref></sup> has become his accuser.<sup><xref rid="fn1384">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Lev. 23:40:) <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C; FOR YOURSELVES &#x003E;</small>. &#x007B;In the name of R. Hiyya he&#x007D; [R. Hiyya] taught in a baraita: Through buying (<italic><small>MQH</small></italic>) and not through stealing, through buying (<italic><small>MQH</small></italic>) and not gratis. &#x003C; Such prohibitions serve &#x003E; to exclude what is borrowed and to exclude what is plundered. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a royal agent who went to collect &#x003C; taxes &#x003E; in the city. After he had collected them, a certain townsperson found him on the road. &#x007B;&#x003C; He was &#x003E; a bandit.&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1385">99</xref></sup> He beat him and took everything belonging to him plus the collected &#x003C; tax money &#x003E; which was in his possession. After some time that townsperson came to be on trial before the governor. He went to hire himself someone who would plead his case. The &#x003C; tax &#x003E; collector said to him: What are you doing here? He said to him: There is a lawsuit, and I wish to hire myself someone who will plead my case. He said to him: Give me [that gold and those articles], that baggage<sup><xref rid="fn1386">100</xref></sup> which you took from me. Then I will plead your case. &#x003C; The bandit &#x003E; said to him: I will do so. He went and gave him that gold and that baggage, &#x003C; but only &#x003E; a little &#x003C; of it &#x003E;. So he went to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1387">101</xref></sup> The next day, when he stood before the governor, he said: Do you have someone who is pleading (<italic>melamed</italic>) your case. He answered and said: Such and such a person. The governor said to him: What case are you making (<italic>melamed</italic>) for this person? He said to him: My Lord, I am telling the things that this companion of mine did to me. When I went to collect taxes in such and such a city, he rose up against me, robbed me, and took everything that I had. And the things which you see in my hands are some of the things which he returned to me so that I would plead his case. Then they all began to say: Woe to that one, for his advocate has become his accuser. Thus, no one from Israel should give praise with a stolen lulav. &#x007B;If he does not have one,&#x007D; [&#x003C; He does not use one &#x003E; unless] he buys (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) it for himself with money, as stated (in Lev. 23:40): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) <small>FOR YOURSELVES</small>.</p>

<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 23:40): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES ON THE FIRST DAY</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Ps. 96:12&#x2013;13 // I Chron. 16:33): <small>THEN SHALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE TREES OF THE FOREST</small>&#x007D; [<small>ALL FOREST TREES</small>] <small>SHOUT FOR JOY &#x003C; BEFORE THE LORD, WHEN HE COMES, WHEN HE COMES TO JUDGE THE EARTH</small>. &#x003E; About whom does the scripture speak? About Israel and about the peoples of the world, when the Holy One judges them on the Day of Atonement. The former and the latter come [for a verdict], but we do not know who will prevail. To what is the matter [comparable]?<sup><xref rid="fn1388">102</xref></sup> To two humans who came before the King for a verdict. Now no one except the king himself knew what the issue was between them. [The king] judged them, but the people did not know who had prevailed against his companion. However, they all know that the one who prevails is the one who leaves with a nut<sup><xref rid="fn1389">103</xref></sup> in his hand. So Israel and the peoples of the world come for a verdict on the Day of Atonement, and the people do not know who is victorious. The Holy One said: Take your lulavim in your hand, so that everyone may know that you have been acquitted in the judgment. Therefore David said (in Ps. 96:12&#x2013;13; // I Chron. 16:33): <small>THEN SHALL &#x003C; ALL FOREST TREES &#x003E; SHOUT FOR JOY &#x003C; BEFORE THE LORD &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. &#x007B;When?&#x007D; (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN HE COMES TO JUDGE THE EARTH</small>. &#x003E; [When?] On the day of Atonement. What does Israel do? They wait for him four days more in order that everyone may hear that Israel has been acquitted. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 23:40:) <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES ON THE FIRST DAY &#x003C; BEAUTIFUL TREE FRUIT, BRANCHES OF PALM TREES, BOUGHS OF DENSE TREES, AND WILLOWS OF THE BROOK; AND YOU SHALL REJOICE BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>. &#x003E;</p>

<p>[(Lev. 23:40:) <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 35:10): <small>ALL MY BONES SHALL SAY: LORD, WHO IS LIKE YOU</small>? David has stated this verse beautifully.<sup><xref rid="fn1390">104</xref></sup> You yourself know that the lulav is like a human spine, the myrtle is like the eyes, the willow is like the lips, and the ethrog is like the heart.

<title>8.29 Leviticus 23:39ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Lev. 23:40:) <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES</small>. After all the wisdom which is ascribed to Solomon (in I Kings 5:10&#x2013;11 [4:31&#x2013;32]): [<small>AND SOLOMON&#x2019;S WISDOM WAS GREATER &#x003C; THAN THE WISDOM OF ALL THE CHILDREN OF THE EAST &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. ] <small>FOR HE WAS THE WISEST OF ALL PEOPLE</small>; he forsook all these things (i.e., astrology, ornithomancy, and the other elements of eastern wisdom)<sup><xref rid="fn1391">105</xref></sup> and sat wondering about these four species.<sup><xref rid="fn1392">106</xref></sup> This text is related (to Prov. 30:18): <small>THREE THINGS ARE TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME</small>, [&#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; Paschal lamb, unleavened bread, and bitter herbs; <small>AND FOUR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND</small>.] These are the four species which are in the lulav, which &#x007B;he was unable&#x007D; [he sought] to understand. Now (in Lev. 23:40) if you say that the <small>BEAUTIFUL TREE FRUIT</small> is an ethrog, all trees bear fruit. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BRANCHES OF PALM TREES</small>. One needs to take two branches [and offer praise with them], but one only takes the heart of the palm, i.e., the lulav. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BOUGHS OF DENSE TREES</small>. Who says to you that it is the myrtle, since it is written in another place (i.e., in Neh. 8:15): <small>GO OUT TO THE MOUNTAIN AND BRING LEAFY BRANCHES OF OLIVE TREES</small>, [<small>LEAFY BRANCHES OF OIL-GIVING TREES, LEAFY BRANCHES OF MYRTLE, LEAFY BRANCHES OF PALMS, AND LEAFY BRANCHES OF DENSE TREES</small>]?

It also says in another place (i.e., in Prov. 30:29): <small>THREE THINGS HAVE A STATELY STRIDE, AND FOUR HAVE A STATELY WALK</small>. These are the four species which are in the lulav, for each and every person from Israel goes running to buy one of them for himself in order to give praise to the Lord. &#x003C; Doing so &#x003E; is acceptable to him and makes atonement to him for all one&#x2019;s sins. <small>A STATELY WALK</small>: The one who sees these same four species, rejoices over them, and they loom large before the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn1393">107</xref></sup> (Prov. 30:24:) <small>FOUR THINGS ARE TINY ON EARTH</small>.

<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 30:24): <small>FOUR THINGS ARE TINY ON EARTH</small>, i.e., four species which seem small but are large in their power.

He said to them: Who are you? They said to him: We are people of such and such a province. He said to them: What would you want? They said to him: If you please, Have mercy upon us. He said to them: I have already remitted half &#x003C; your debt &#x003E;, but for your sake I am remitting half of &#x003C; the remaining &#x003E; half. While he [was &#x003C; still &#x003E; on the road], all the people of the province came out. He said to them: Now what do you want? They said to him: O our Lord King, we have nothing to remit. Have mercy on us. He said to them: I have already remitted half plus half of &#x003C; the remaining &#x003E; half, but for your sake I am remitting everything. However, from now on there is a new account (<italic>heshbon</italic>). This king is [the Supreme King of Kings], the Holy One. The people of his province? These are Israel, who acquire sins during all of the whole year. What does the Holy One do? He says: Do penance at the beginning of the year. So they come in submission on the Day of Atonement, when they humble themselves and do penance. Then the Holy One forgives them everything. So during Tabernacles they all take their lulavim on the first day of the festival and render praise to the Holy One. Thus he is reconciled to them and forgives them. He says to them: See, I have waived all your former sins for you. [However, from now on there is a new account (<italic>heshbon</italic>). Thus it is stated (in Lev. 23:40): <small>AND YOU SHALL TAKE FOR YOURSELVES ON THE FIRST DAY</small>. &#x003C; It is &#x003E; first for the reckoning (<italic>heshbon</italic>) of sins.] The Holy One said to them: In this world I have told you to make a sukkah in order to pay me my remuneration for what I have done for you. It is so stated (in Lev. 23:42&#x2013;43): [<small>YOU SHALL DWELL IN SUKKOT FOR SEVEN DAYS</small>&#x2026;,] <small>&#x003C; IN ORDER THAT YOUR GENERATIONS MAY KNOW &#x003E; THAT I HAD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DWELL IN SUKKOT</small>. So I reckon it to your credit, as if you are rendering payment to me. But in the world to come I will appear over you like a sukkah, as stated (in Is. 4:6): <small>THERE SHALL BE A SUKKAH AS A SHADE FROM THE HEAT BY DAY</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>8.31 Leviticus 24:10ff, Part I</title>
<p>[(Lev. 24:10:) <small>NOW THERE WENT OUT THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN</small>. From where did he go out?<sup><xref rid="fn1404">118</xref></sup> R. Levi says: He went out from his world, just as it is stated (in I Sam. 17:4): <small>AND THERE WENT OUT A CHAMPION</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">119</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah said: He went out (i.e., became excluded from Israel) because of (literally: from) the preceding parashah, where it is written (in Lev. 24:5): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE FINE FLOUR AND BAKE IT INTO TWELVE LOAVES</small>. He said: It is customary for the king to eat warm bread. Would &#x003C; he eat it &#x003E; cold? It is like that which we learn there (in the latter part of Men. 11:9): <small>THE SHEWBREAD WAS EATEN NO EARLIER THAN THE NINTH DAY &#x003C; AFTER BAKING &#x003E; AND NO LATER THAN THE ELEVENTH DAY. HOW SO? IT WAS BAKED ON THE EVE OF THE SABBATH AND EATEN ON THE SABBATH &#x003C; OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK, I.E., &#x003E; ON THE NINTH DAY. &#x003C; IF &#x003E; A HOLIDAY HAPPENED TO FALL ON THE EVE OF THE SABBATH, IT WAS EATEN ON THE TENTH. &#x003C; IN THE CASE OF &#x003E; THE TWO-DAY HOLIDAY OF THE NEW YEAR, IT WAS EATEN ON THE ELEVENTH, FOR &#x003C; THE BAKING &#x003E; OVERRIDES NEITHER THE SABBATH NOR A HOLIDAY. R. SIMEON B. GAMALIEL SAYS IN THE NAME OF</small> &#x007B;<small>RABBI</small>&#x007D; <small>SIMEON THE SON OF THE SAGAN: &#x003C; THE BAKING &#x003E; OVERRIDES A HOLIDAY BUT DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE FAST DAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1406">120</xref></sup> (According the first part of Men. 11:9) <small>THE TWO LOAVES OF BREAD &#x003C; OFFERED AT PENTECOST &#x003E; WERE EATEN NO EARLIER THAN THE SECOND DAY AND NO LATER THAN THE THIRD. HOW SO? THEY WERE BAKED ON THE EVE OF THE FESTIVAL &#x003C; OF WEEKS AND &#x003E; EATEN ON THE FESTIVAL, &#x003C; I.E., &#x003E; ON THE SECOND DAY. IF THE FESTIVAL HAPPENED TO FALL ON THE DAY AFTER THE SABBATH, THEY WERE EATEN ON THE THIRD DAY</small>.]</p>
<title>8.32 Leviticus 24:10ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 24:10:) <small>NOW THERE WENT OUT THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN, &#x003C; WHOSE FATHER WAS EGYPTIAN &#x003E;</small>. From where did he go out? R. Hiyya bar Abba said: he went out (i.e., became excluded from Israel) because of (literally: from) the parashah on genealogies.<sup><xref rid="fn1407">121</xref></sup> When he came to pitch his tent in the camp of Dan, they rejected him. Now they said to him: You have an Egyptian father, but it is written (in Numb. 2:2): <small>&#x003C; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL CAMP, &#x003E; EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS OF THEIR FATHERS</small>&#x2018; <small>HOUSES</small>, and not of their mothers&#x2019; houses. [Immediately,] (according to Lev. 24:11) he began to utter the Name and curse it. R. Levi said: He was a bastard. How so? Taskmasters were from Egypt, and the officers were from Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1408">122</xref></sup> The taskmaster was in charge of ten officers, and the officer &#x003C; was in charge &#x003E; of ten Israelites. &#x003C; Thus, &#x003E; it turned out that the taskmaster was in charge of a hundred &#x007B;and ten&#x007D; Israelites. On one occasion a taskmaster met an officer. He said to him: Go gather your groups of ten. When he had gone, he entered his house and seduced Shelomith, the officer&#x2019;s wife. &#x003C; When &#x003E; her husband returned, he found him leaving his house. When &#x003C; the taskmaster &#x003E; knew that &#x003C; her husband &#x003E; noticed him, he beat him every day. The Holy Spirit was kindled in Moses. He raised his eyes to the sky. He said: Was it not enough for this wicked man to rape his wife, but that he should return and beat him? Immediately (according to Exod. 2:12) <small>HE SMOTE THE EGYPTIAN AND HID HIM IN THE SAND</small>. The Holy One said: In this world you are delivered through sins into the hands of the nations of the world. However, in the world to come (according to Is. 49:23): <small>KINGS SHALL BE YOUR GUARDIANS; THEIR LADIES, YOUR WET NURSES</small>; [<small>THEY SHALL BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU, NOSE TO THE GROUND, AND LICK THE DUST OF YOUR FEET. THEN YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD. THOSE WHO TRUST ME SHALL NOT BE ASHAMED</small>.]</p>

<title>Chapter 9 Leviticus, Parashah IX: <italic>Behar</italic></title>
<title>9.1 Leviticus 25:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI, SAYING</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>, [<small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>]. This verse speaks about a lot of Adam&#x2019;s children: &#x007B;about Cain, about Ephron, and about one who lends at interest&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">1</xref></sup> [<small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This was Cain, since he killed his brother so that he would inherit the world for himself. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>.] The Holy One said: You moved quickly to become rich and inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>. And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12): <small>YOU SHALL BECOME A CEASELESS WANDERER ON THE EARTH</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>: This is Cain.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This was Ephron the Hittite.<sup><xref rid="fn1410">2</xref></sup> When Abraham&#x2019;s wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him: Give me its price. He said to him (in Gen. 23:15): <small>WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? SO BURY YOUR DEAD</small>. Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16): <small>SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON</small>&#x2026;. Ben Ma&#x2019;ma said: Although R. Hanina has said: All the shekels in the Torah are <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>, these &#x003C; shekels &#x003E; are an exception, since they are <italic>centenaria.<sup><xref rid="fn1411">3</xref></sup></italic> &#x003C; It was &#x003E; four hundred centenaria &#x003C; that &#x003E; Abraham piled up before Ephron. When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and was persuaded, as stated (in Gen. 23:6): <small>BURY YOUR DEAD IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR TOMBS</small>. The Holy One said to him: You have moved quickly after money. (Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. (Prov. 28:22, cont.): <small>AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY</small> (<small>HSR</small>) <small>WILL COME TO HIM</small>. And what was his loss (rt.: <italic><small>HSR</small></italic>)? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Every <small>EPHRON</small> which is written here &#x003C; in Scripture &#x003E;, before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as &#x2018;<italic><small>PRWN</small></italic> (i.e., with the vowel <italic>O</italic> represented by the Hebrew consonant <italic>W</italic>); but this &#x003C; usage &#x003E; (in Gen. 23:6) is deficient (<small><italic>HSR</italic></small>): <small>AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>PRN</small></italic>). It is written with the <italic>W</italic> missing (<italic><small>HSR</small></italic>).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): <small>AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>. This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, <small>AND</small> (ibid., cont.) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): [<small>&#x003C; AN EVIL-EYED PERSON &#x003E; MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH</small>&#x2026;. ] This represents those who engage in business in the Sabbatical Year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the Sabbatical Year but are intent on becoming rich. The Holy One said to them: You have moved quickly to become rich from the Sabbatical Year. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. But he only acted when he did not observe the Sabbatical Year. The curse began entering into his money, and he sold all that he had. What is written elsewhere on the matter (in Lev. 25:2): <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE A SABBATH FOR THE LORD</small>. And after that it is written (in vs. 14): <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE</small>.</p>
<title>9.2 Leviticus 25:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>R. Eleazar haQappar said: It is written (in Cant. 5:15): <small>HIS LEGS ARE PILLARS OF MARBLE, SET UPON SOCKETS OF FINE GOLD</small>&#x2026;. If a column does not have a capital above and a pedestal<sup><xref rid="fn1412">4</xref></sup> below, it does not seem beautiful.<sup><xref rid="fn1413">5</xref></sup> R. Samuel ben Gedaliah said: You do have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below.<sup><xref rid="fn1414">6</xref></sup> What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1&#x2013;2:)? <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE &#x003C; A SABBATH FOR THE LORD &#x003E;</small>. Then after that &#x003C; comes &#x003E; the section on the Jubilee (in vs. 8): <small>AND YOU SHALL COUNT SEVEN SABBATHS OF YEARS</small>. If one has not observed the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee, he will end up selling his chattels, [as stated] (in vs. 14): <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1415">7</xref></sup> &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, &#x003C; all &#x003E; is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, [as stated] (in vs. 25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around &#x003C; begging &#x003E; at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35): <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU &#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39): [<small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>] <small>NEAR YOU AND IS SOLD TO YOU</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47): <small>AND WHEN A FOREIGNER AND A SOJOURNER NEAR YOU BECOMES WEALTHY, &#x003C; WHILE YOUR RELATIVE NEAR HIM BECOMES POOR AND IS SOLD TO A SOJOURNING FOREIGNER NEAR YOU</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> Now it is not merely the individual himself &#x003C; at issue here &#x003E;, but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the Sabbatical Year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17&#x2013;18): <small>SO HE BROUGHT UP THE KING OF THE CHALDEANS UPON THEM</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>AND ALL THE VESSELS OF THE HOUSE OF GOD</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>AND THE TREASURES OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>&#x003C; ALL THESE HE BROUGHT TO BABYLON &#x003E;</small>. Consider the case of Israel. The Holy One said to Moses: See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the Sabbatical Year. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, did you not say this (in Lev. 25:35): <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>, [<small>AND HIS STRENGTH FAILS NEAR YOU</small>], <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU &#x003E;</small>? Fulfill what you said. [Israel is your brother (<italic>ah</italic>), as stated (in Ps. 122:8): <small>FOR THE SAKE</small>] <small>OF MY RELATIVES</small> (<italic>ah</italic>) <small>AND FRIENDS</small>. (Lev. 25:35:) <small>AND WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR, AND HIS STRENGTH FAILS NEAR YOU</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14): <small>FOR YOUR SAKE I HAVE SENT TO BABYLON</small>. (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL MAINTAIN HIM</small>. Take them (i.e., Israel) by the hand, lest they perish by his (Babylon&#x2019;s) hand. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) <small>AS A FOREIGNER AND SOJOURNER AND LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU</small>. Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, just <small>LET HIM LIVE NEAR YOU</small>. The Holy One said to him: Because of their sins I have sold my house to the Chaldeans, as stated (in Lev. 25:29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. This is the house of the Holy One. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 132:13): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS CHOSEN ZION; HE HAS DESIRED IT FOR HIS DWELLING</small>. And what happened to it? (II Kings 25:9 &#x003D; Jer. 52:13:) <small>AND HE BURNED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small>. (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) <small>&#x003C; IN &#x003E; A WALLED CITY</small>. [This is the city of the Holy One, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19): <small>AND THEY BROKE DOWN THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM</small>&#x2026;. That is what the Holy One says (in Lev. 25:47): <small>AND WHEN A FOREIGNER AND A SOJOURNER &#x003C; NEAR YOU &#x003E; BECOMES WEALTHY</small>. This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median empire. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>&#x003C; WHILE YOUR RELATIVE NEAR HIM BECOMES POOR &#x003E; AND IS SOLD TO A SOJOURNING FOREIGNER NEAR YOU</small>. This &#x003C; sojourning foreigner] is the Greek empire. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR TO AN OFFSHOOT OF A FOREIGNER&#x2019;S FAMILY</small>. This is the fourth empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World: Why were they sold to these empires? He said to him: Because they profaned the Sabbatical Year. It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20&#x2013;21): <small>THEN HE CARRIED OFF UNTO BABYLON THOSE LEFT FROM THE SWORD, AND THEY BECAME SLAVES TO HIM AND HIS CHILDREN, UNTIL THE RULE OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE, IN ORDER TO FULFILL THE WORD OF THE LORD IN THE MOUTH OF JEREMIAH, UNTIL THE LAND MADE UP ITS SABBATHS. AS LONG AS IT LAYDESOLATE, IT OBSERVED SABBATH, TO FULFILL SEVENTY YEARS</small>. Therefore the Holy One said to Moses: Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? &#x003C; Then &#x003E; warn them concerning the Sabbatical Years and the Jubilees. That is what he has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2): <small>YOU SHALL OBSERVE MY SABBATHS AND REVERENCE MY SANCTUARY. I AM THE LORD</small>. I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the empires. Therefore, warn them about the Sabbatical Year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2): <small>THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE A SABBATH FOR THE LORD</small>, so that they do not attain &#x003C; the punishments in &#x003E; those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14&#x2013;45).</p>
<title>9.3 Leviticus 25:14ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:14:) <small>AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE TO YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>, [<small>OR BUY FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S HAND</small>,] <small>LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW</small>. Thus you shall not deceive one another, for I also have sold. When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One. Before the Torah was given, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra: Abraham even observed the <italic>eruvim</italic> of cooked foods.<sup><xref rid="fn1416">8</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): <small>BECAUSE</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>QB</small></italic> &#x2018;<italic><small>ShR</small></italic>) <small>ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE AND KEPT MY CHARGE: &#x003C; MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of &#x2018;<italic><small>QB</small></italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1417">9</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Laqish said: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn1418">10</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic><small>QB</small></italic> is a number. &#x2018; (i.e., &#x2018;<italic>ayin</italic>) is seventy, <italic>Q</italic> (i.e., <italic>Qof</italic>) is one hundred, &#x003C; and &#x003E; <italic>B</italic> (i.e., <italic>bet</italic>) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five &#x003C; years &#x003E;. Deduct from them. &#x003C; The result is &#x003E; three, when he was little. Ergo: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One.] When the Holy One saw how Abraham loved the commandments, he began buying heavenly and earthly &#x003C; places &#x003E; for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19): <small>BLESSED BE ABRAM OF GOD MOST HIGH</small>, [<small>BUYER</small><sup><xref rid="fn1419">11</xref></sup> <small>OF HEAVEN AND EARTH</small>. So also it says (Gen. 13:15): <small>FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, TO YOU I WILL GIVE IT</small>.] The Holy One said: All the world is wholly mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed my commandments. But you [through your sins] have cause me to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8): <small>WHY ARE YOU LIKE A FOREIGNER IN THE LAND</small>? When you sinned before me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13 [12]): <small>YOU SHALL SELL YOUR PEOPLE FOR NO MONEY</small>&#x2026;. For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or &#x003C; some &#x003E; article, you shall not deceive one another. It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14): <small>LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW</small>. (Ibid., vs. 17) <small>AND LET NO ONE DECEIVE HIS NEIGHBOR</small>.</p>
<title>9.4 Leviticus 25:14ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:18, 23:) <small>SO YOU SHALL CARRY OUT MY STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. [<small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY</small>.] The Holy One said to him: Similarly I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14:) <small>TURN BACK, FAITHLESS CHILDREN, SAYS THE LORD; FOR I AM A MASTER TO YOU</small>. It is also written (in Is. 52:3): [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU WERE SOLD FOR FREE, AND YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED FOR NO MONEY</small>. You shall therefore not sell the land absolutely, since it is stated (in Lev. 25:23): <small>BUT THE LAND MAY NOT BE SOLD PERMANENTLY, FOR THE LAND BELONGS TO ME</small>. The land of Israel is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the &#x003C; other &#x003E; lands. You yourself know, when the land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. So look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One gave thanks for their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7): <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>&#x2026;. (Numb. 36:9:) <small>THUS NO INHERITANCE SHALL BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE TRIBE TO ANOTHER</small>. Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever takes it acquires it until the Jubilee. Then on the Jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41): <small>THEN HE SHALL DEPART</small> &#x007B;<small>IN THE JUBILEE</small>&#x007D; [<small>FROM YOU</small>], <small>HE AND HIS CHILDREN WITH HIM</small>. The Holy One said: When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4): <small>FOR A DAY OF VENGEANCE WAS IN MY HEART, BUT THERE CAME MY YEAR OF REDEMPTION</small>.</p>
<title>9.5 Leviticus 25:25ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E; This text is related (to Prov. 22:22&#x2013;23): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED&#x2026;; FOR THE LORD SHALL PLEAD THEIR CAUSE</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to Israel: Do not rob the impoverished because he is impoverished, for I have made him impoverished, and whoever robs him or mocks at him reproaches his maker.<sup><xref rid="fn1420">12</xref></sup> &#x003C; It is &#x003E; as if he is mocking at me. It is so stated (in Prov. 17:5): <small>ONE WHO MOCKS A POOR PERSON REPROACHES HIS MAKER</small>. What is the meaning of (Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED</small>? Is there someone robbing the impoverished? Of what does he rob him, when he is impoverished?<sup><xref rid="fn1421">13</xref></sup> It is simply that, if you are accustomed to maintaining<sup><xref rid="fn1422">14</xref></sup> him, &#x003C; if &#x003E; you have reconsidered and said: How long do I supply him? and &#x003C; if &#x003E; you are holding back from giving to him; know that you are robbing him. Ergo (in Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED &#x003C; BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED &#x003E;</small>; but maintain him, because there is no other place for him. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DO NOT OPPRESS THE POOR IN THE GATE</small>, lest I stop up the heavens because of you; for they (i.e., the heavens) are also called a gate, where it is stated (in Gen. 28:17): <small>&#x003C; THIS IS NOTHING BUT THE ABODE OF GOD, &#x003E; AND THIS ISA GATE, THE HEAVENS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1423">15</xref></sup> (Prov. 22:23): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL PLEAD THEIR CAUSE</small>. I am pleading &#x003C; their cause &#x003E; with you,<sup><xref rid="fn1424">16</xref></sup> because I made him poor and you rich. I am inverting my charm<sup><xref rid="fn1425">17</xref></sup> and will make him rich and you poor. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 22:2): <small>RICH AND POOR MEET; THE LORD MADE THEM ALL</small>. Why? (Prov. 22:23:) <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL PLEAD THEIR CAUSE</small>. Why? Because you are reducing his livelihood (<italic>nefesh</italic>), if you do not maintain him. Therefore (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE WILL ROB THE ONES WHO ROB THEM OF LIFE</small> (<italic>nefesh</italic>).</p>
<title>9.6 Leviticus 25:25ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED &#x003C; TO HIM, AND REDEEM &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Who is his redeemer?<sup><xref rid="fn1426">18</xref></sup> I am he, as stated (in Jer. 50:33&#x2013;34): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: &#x003C; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003E; ARE OPPRESSED</small>&#x2026;. <small>THEIR REDEEMER IS MIGHTY, &#x003C; HIS NAME IS &#x003E; THE LORD &#x003C; OF HOSTS &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>.] Seven names are given to the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn1427">19</xref></sup> They are the following: crushed (<italic>dakh</italic>), poor (&#x2018;<italic>ani</italic>), lowly (<italic>makh</italic>), dispossessed (rash), oppressed (<italic><small>TKK</small></italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1428">20</xref></sup> wretched (<italic>misken</italic>), and pauper (<italic>evyon</italic>).</p>
<title>9.7 Leviticus 25:25ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Ps. 106:43): <small>MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM</small>&#x2026;; [<small>SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>]. You find that in the days of the judges Israel served idols; so they were enslaved in the hands of the peoples of the world, as stated (in Jud. 3:7&#x2013;8): <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID EVIL IN THE SIGHT OF THE LORD&#x2026;. &#x003C; SO THE ANGER OF THE LORD WAS KINDLED AGAINST ISRAEL, AND HE DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HANDS OF KING CUSH-RISHATHAIM OF ARAM-NAHARAIM</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> What did they do (according to vs. 9)? <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CRIED UNTO THE LORD, AND THE LORD RAISED UP A SAVIOR FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [<small>TO SAVE THEM, I.E.,</small>] <small>OTHNIEL BENKENAZ</small>. They immediately repented and were redeemed. So &#x003C; it happened &#x003E; another time, [as stated] (in Jud. 3:12): <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AGAIN DID EVIL</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;; <small>SO THE LORD STRENGTHENED EGLON</small>&#x2026;. [They immediately repented;] so the Lord raised up a redeemer for them &#x007B;when they repented&#x007D;, Ehud [ben Gera; and they were redeemed at his hands]. Then they served idols again and were sold into the hands of Sisera, as stated (in Jud. 4:3): <small>AND HE OPPRESSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WITH MIGHT</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WITH MIGHT</small>? R. Simeon ben Levi said: With blasphemies and with curses,<sup><xref rid="fn1429">21</xref></sup> just as you say (in Mal. 3:13): <small>YOUR WORDS HAVE BEEN MIGHTY AGAINST ME</small>. When they repented, he raised up Barak and Deborah as redeemers for them; [and they were redeemed at their hands]. Ergo (in Ps. 106:43): <small>MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM&#x2026;; SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>? That they became impoverished in the midst of the nations, as stated (in Jud. 6:6): <small>AND ISRAEL BECAME VERY IMPOVERISHED</small>&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>AND &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; BECAME &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; IMPOVERISHED</small>? R. Isaac and R. Levi differed. One said that they were impoverished (rt.: <italic><small>DLL</small></italic>) from good works, and the other said that they did not have &#x003C; enough &#x003E; to bring even a poor person&#x2019;s (rt.: <italic><small>DLL</small></italic>) offering, as stated (in Lev. 14:21): <small>IF, HOWEVER, HE IS POOR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DLL</small></italic>) [<small>AND DOES NOT HAVE THE MEANS</small>&#x2026;. ] Ergo (in Ps. 106:43): <small>SO THEY BECAME POOR</small>, because they had become impoverished (rt.: <italic><small>DLL</small></italic>).</p>
<title>9.8 Leviticus 25:25ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 106:43): <small>MANY TIMES HE DELIVERED THEM</small>. &#x003C; These words &#x003E; speak about the children of Adam.<sup><xref rid="fn1430">22</xref></sup> When trouble comes to one &#x003C; of them &#x003E;, he immediately repents, and the Holy One delivers him. So it is the first time and the second. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he repents, that is preferable; but if not, &#x003C; the Holy One &#x003E; brings trouble upon him. Why? Because it is difficult for the Holy One to raise his hand against a human being. So what does he do to him? When he sins, he begins by raising his hand against his assets. From whom have you learned it? From Naomi, her sons, and Elimelech, who was the head of &#x003C; his &#x003E; generation. When famine came, what did he do? He left the land of Israel and went to the land of Moab. Now the Holy One was angry with him because he was prince (<italic>nasi</italic>) of &#x003C; his &#x003E; generation. The Holy One said to him: If my children had acted like this, they would have left the land of Israel a wilderness. What is written there (in Ruth 1:3)? <small>THEN NAOMI&#x2019;S HUSBAND ELIMELECH DIED</small>, but his sons were unable to learn from their father to return to the land of Israel. And what did they do in addition? (According to vs. 4) <small>THEY TOOK MOABITE WIVES FOR THEMSELVES</small>, whom they neither baptized nor proselytized.<sup><xref rid="fn1431">23</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ORPAH</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>RPH</small></italic>) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE SECOND WAS RUTH: ORPAH</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>RPH</small></italic>), because she turned her back (&#x2018;<italic><small>RP</small></italic>) on her mother-in-law; <small>RUTH</small>, because she regarded (<italic><small>R&#x2019;TH</small></italic>) the words of her mother-in-law. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THEY LIVED THERE ABOUT TEN YEARS</small>. All those ten years (in Moab) the Holy One had been warning them. When he saw that they did not repent, he began to raise his hand against their camels and against their cattle; but they did not return.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">24</xref></sup> When he saw that they did not repent (literally: return in repentance), immediately (in vs. 5): <small>BOTH OF THEM, MAHLON AND CHILION, ALSO DIED</small>. Thus &#x003C; you may infer &#x003E; that it is difficult for the Holy One to raise his hand against a human being. So what does he do to them? He deprives them of their assets, and they sell them.</p>
<p>When someone sins, what does the Holy One do to him first? He brings poverty upon him so that he sells his field, as stated (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1433">25</xref></sup> If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells his house, as stated (in Lev. 25:29): <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE SELLS A DWELLING HOUSE</small>. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells his daughter, as stated (in Exod. 21:7): <small>AND IF SOMEONE SELLS HIS DAUGHTER AS A SLAVE</small>. If he repents, then fine; but if not he sells himself, as stated (in Deut. 15:12): <small>IF THERE IS SOLD TO YOU A FELLOW HEBREW</small>. Why all this? Because they became poor through &#x003C; their &#x003E; iniquities. (Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>.</p>
<p>(Lev. 25:25:) <small>&#x003C; WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, &#x003E; THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, &#x003C; THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM, AND REDEEM</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> Who was this? Boaz. When? When Naomi sold the field, as stated (in Ruth 4:3): <small>NAOMI IS SELLING THE PARCEL OF LAND WHICH BELONGED TO OUR KINSMAN ELIMELECH</small>. Ergo (in Lev. 25:25): <small>AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small>. R. Simeon ben Johay said: Elimelech, Salmon, So-and-So,<sup><xref rid="fn1434">26</xref></sup> and Naomi&#x2019;s father were all descendants of Nahshon ben Amminadab.<sup><xref rid="fn1435">27</xref></sup> Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion were leaders<sup><xref rid="fn1436">28</xref></sup> of the generation. So for what reason were they punished? Because they went abroad from the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Ruth 1:19): <small>&#x003C; WHEN THEY CAME TO BETHLEHEM, &#x003E; THE WHOLE CITY WAS EXCITED OVER THEM, AND THE WOMEN SAID: IS THIS NAOMI</small>? What is the meaning of <small>IS THIS NAOMI</small>? You saw Naomi when she went abroad from the land of Israel. What has happened to her? (Lev. 25:25:) <small>THEN HIS REDEEMER</small> (<italic>go&#x2019;el</italic>) <small>SHALL COME, &#x003C; THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED</small> (<italic>qarov) &#x003E;.</italic> This is Boaz, since it is stated (in Ruth 2:20): <small>THE MAN IS OUR RELATIVE</small> (<italic>qarov</italic>), <small>HE IS ONE OF OUR REDEEMING KIN</small> (<italic>go&#x2019;el</italic>). At that time Ruth went to Boaz. Her mother-in-law said to her (in Ruth 3:2): <small>SEE, HE IS WINNOWING BARLEY ON THE THRESHING FLOOR TONIGHT</small>. &#x003C; If &#x003E; he was a prince (<italic>nasi</italic>), would he have been winnowing on a threshing floor?<sup><xref rid="fn1437">29</xref></sup> It is simply because his generation was dissolute in sexual matters, that he went out to guard his threshing floor. She said to her (in vs. 3): <small>YOU ARE TO WASH AND ANOINT YOURSELF</small>. Then after that (ibid): <small>AND GO DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR</small>. &#x201C;And I shall go down&#x201D; is &#x007B;not written&#x007D; [the actual written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>)]. She said to her: My merit will go down with you.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">30</xref></sup> She did not do as her mother-in-law had told her. What did Ruth do? After she went down to the threshing floor, she did &#x003C; what she was told &#x003E;, as stated (in vs. 6): <small>SHE WENT DOWN TO THE THRESHING FLOOR AND DID JUST AS HER MOTHER-IN-LAW HAD COMMANDED HER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1439">31</xref></sup> Why? It is simply that she said: The generation was dissolute in sexual matters. What if they see me made up and say: Perhaps she is a harlot? (Vs. 7:) <small>THEN, WHEN BOAZ HAD EATEN AND DRUNK, AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND HIS HEART WAS MERRY</small>? That he was busy at the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">32</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (by wisdom in Prov. 9:5): <small>COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD</small>. (Ruth 3:7, cont.:) <small>AND WHEN HE CAME TO LIE DOWN BESIDE THE GRAIN PILE, THEN SHE CAME IN SECRET</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>IN SECRET</small> (<small><italic>LT</italic></small>; rt.: <italic><small>LWT</small></italic>)? In a hiding place,] just as you say (in I Sam. 21:10 [9]): <small>HERE IT IS WRAPPED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LWT</small></italic>) <small>IN A MANTLE</small>. (Ruth 3:8:) <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO HE TURNED ASIDE, &#x003C; AND HERE WAS A WOMAN LYING AT HIS FEET &#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TURNED ASIDE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LPT</small></italic>)? That he seized her head, because he thought that it was a spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn1441">33</xref></sup> &#x003C; It is &#x003E; just as you say (in Jud. 16:29): <small>AND SAMSON EMBRACED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LPT</small></italic>) <small>THE TWO MIDDLE PILLARS</small>. (Ruth <italic>3:9:</italic>) <small>THEN HE SAID: WHO ARE YOU? AND SHE SAID: I AM YOUR HANDMAID RUTH</small>. He said to her: what have you come here to do? She said to him: To fulfill the Torah (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>&#x2026;, [<small>THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME</small>]. Arise and fulfill the Torah. He said to her: Since you have come to fulfill the Torah, (Ruth 3:13:) <small>SPEND THE NIGHT. THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT, IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU, GOOD</small> (<italic>tov</italic>); for he had a kinsman older than he, whose name was Tov. R. Hanina said: She said to him: Are you dismissing me with words? He said to her (Ibid., cont.): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>, I am not dismissing you with words. (Ruth 4:1:) <small>THEN BOAZ WENT UP TO THE GATE AND SAT DOWN THERE, &#x003C; AND BEHOLD, THE REDEEMER OF WHOM BOAZ HAD SPOKEN WAS PASSING BY &#x003E;</small>. He said to him: Sit down, and we shall look into the Torah. What &#x003C; is written &#x003E; (in Lev. 25:25)? <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR &#x003C; AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM, AND REDEEM</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small> Boaz said to Tov (in Ruth 4:3&#x2013;4): <small>NAOMI IS SELLING THE PARCEL OF LAND WHICH BELONGED TO OUR KINSMAN ELIMELECH</small> &#x003C; &#x2026;; &#x003E; <small>AND I THOUGHT I SHOULD DISCLOSE IT TO YOU, SAYING: BUY IT</small>, since you are an older kinsman than I &#x003C; and have the right &#x003E; to redeem it. (Vs. 4, cont.:) <small>IF YOU WILL REDEEM IT, REDEEM IT</small>. (Vs. 6:) <small>THEN THE REDEEMER SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>TO BOAZ</small>&#x007D;: <small>&#x003C; YOU &#x003E; TAKE OVER &#x003C; MY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION &#x003E; FOR YOURSELF</small>. At that time Boaz redeemed what Naomi had sold. Now from where did Boaz learn &#x003C; what to do &#x003E;? From this section (in Lev. 25:25): <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY, &#x003C; THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM, AND REDEEM</small>&#x2026;. <small>&#x003E;</small></p>
<title>9.9 Leviticus 25:25ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Lev. 25:25:) <small>WHEN YOUR RELATIVE BECOMES POOR</small>. This is Israel, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 106:43): <small>SO THEY BECAME POOR THROUGH THEIR INIQUITY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">34</xref></sup> (Lev. 25:25, cont.:) <small>AND SELLS SOME OF HIS PROPERTY</small>, into the hand of a Mede, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; into the hands of Haman. (Lev. 25:25, cont.:) <small>THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME</small>. This is Mordecai. (Lev. 25:25, cont.:) <small>AND REDEEM WHAT HIS RELATIVE HAS SOLD</small>, in that he covered up the sins of Israel, since they all were deserving of slaughter, because they had eaten some cooked food of star worshipers.<sup><xref rid="fn1443">35</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Esth. 1:5): <small>AND WHEN THESE DAYS WERE FULFILLED, THE KING MADE &#x003C; A SEVEN-DAY BANQUET &#x003E; FOR ALL THE PEOPLE &#x003C; THAT WERE TO BE FOUND IN SHUSHAN THE CAPITAL, BOTH GREAT AND SMALL &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Now Haman was jealous of them (i.e., of the Jews), as stated (in Esth. 3:7): <small>PUR</small>, &#x003C; i.e., <small>THE LOT, &#x003E; WAS CAST &#x003C; BEFORE HAMAN &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">36</xref></sup> But due to Mordecai they were delivered, as stated (in Esth. 9:1): <small>THE OPPOSITE HAPPENED, &#x003C; IN THAT THE JEWS GAINED CONTROL OVER THEIR ENEMIES &#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in (Lev. 25:25, cont.:) <small>AND REDEEM WHAT HIS RELATIVE HAS SOLD</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 25:25, cont.:) <small>THEN HIS REDEEMER SHALL COME, THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO HIM</small>. This is the Holy One, since it is stated (in Jer. 50:34): <small>THEIR REDEEMER IS MIGHTY, &#x003C; HIS NAME IS &#x003E; THE LORD &#x003C; OF HOSTS &#x003E;</small>. (Lev. 25:25): <small>THE ONE MOST CLOSELY RELATED</small> (<italic>qarov</italic>) <small>TO HIM</small>. This is the Holy One, since it is stated (in Ps. 148:14): <small>HE HAS RAISED UP A HORN FOR HIS PEOPLE, PRAISE FOR ALL HIS SAINTS, EVEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, A PEOPLE NEAR</small> (<italic>qarov</italic>) <small>TO HIM.

<title>Chapter 10 Leviticus, Parashah I: <italic>Behuqqotay</italic></title>
<title>10.1 Leviticus 26:3ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>)&#x2026;. This text is related (to Job 14:5): <small>IF HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED</small>, [<small>THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS IS WITH YOU; YOU HAVE SET LIMITS</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>IF HIS DAYS ARE DETERMINED</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1445">1</xref></sup> When the Holy One created the world, he determined the days of each and every one, as stated (in Gen. 1:14): <small>AND LET THEM BE FOR SIGNS, SEASONS</small>, [<small>DAYS, AND YEARS</small>]. Now to whom did he give them? To Israel, as stated (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB</small>, [<small>HIS STATUTES</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>) <small>AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL</small>]. (Job 14:5, cont.:) <small>THE NUMBER OF HIS MONTHS IS WITH YOU; YOU HAVE SET HIS LIMITS</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>). The Holy One said to Israel: If you have carried out &#x007B;his&#x007D; [my] statutes (<italic>huqqim</italic>), the Adversary (<italic>Satan</italic>) shall not touch you, although it is stated (of Death in Is. 28:19): <small>AS OFTEN AS HE TRANSGRESSES, HE SHALL SEIZE YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">2</xref></sup> (Job 14:5, cont.:) <small>YOU HAVE SET HIS LIMITS</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>. I said so to Solomon, when he asked for wisdom. And what did I say to him? (I Kings 3:13:) <small>I HAVE ALSO GRANTED YOU WHAT YOU DID NOT ASK, BOTH RICHES AND HONOR</small>. So if you fulfill the Torah, the angel of death shall not touch you, as stated to him (in I Kings 3:14): <small>THEN I WILL LENGTHEN YOUR DAYS</small>. (Job 14:5:) <small>YOU HAVE SET LIMITS</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>) <small>THAT HE SHALL NOT TRANSGRESS</small>&#x2026;. If the first Adam had observed the Torah, the ordinances that I gave him, he would not have died. Therefore, it is written (in Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small> (<italic>huqqim</italic>)&#x2026;.</p>
<title>10.2 Leviticus 26:3ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>&#x2026;.] This text is related (to Hos. 9:17): <small>GOD</small><sup><xref rid="fn1447">3</xref></sup> <small>WILL REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HEED HIM</small>. The Holy One said: I have said that you would be set in security, as stated (in Amos 9:15): <small>AND WHEN I PLANT THEM IN THEIR LAND</small>, [<small>THEY SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE UPROOTED</small>]&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">4</xref></sup> When? (Lev.: 26:3, 5:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. <small>YOU SHALL EAT YOUR FILL OF BREAD &#x003C; AND DWELL SECURELY IN YOUR LAND &#x003E;</small>. I have so counseled, but you did not so act. Instead (according to II Kings 17:9): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ATTRIBUTED THINGS WHICH WERE NOT RIGHT &#x003C; TO THE LORD THEIR GOD: THEY BUILT THEMSELVES HIGH PLACES IN ALL THEIR CITIES &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. I have also set upon you things which I did not write in the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 28:61): <small>MOREOVER &#x003C; THE LORD WILL BRING UPON YOU &#x003E; EVERY DISEASE AND EVERY PLAGUE WHICH IS NOT WRITTEN IN</small> &#x007B;<small>THIS BOOK OF THE TORAH</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE BOOK OF THIS TORAH</small>]. Now surely [if] you have set [things] on me which were not &#x003C; right &#x003E; by me, just as Isaiah said (in Is. 1:4): <small>THEY HAVE FORSAKEN THE LORD</small>; do not say: <small>THEY HAVE FORSAKEN</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>ZBW</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C; ME &#x003E;</small>, but: They, as it were, have made me worth forsaking (&#x2018;<italic><small>YZBW</small></italic>) (i.e., caused me to be cruel). Now I was called (in Exod. 34:6): <small>A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, SLOW TO ANGER</small>, but through their sins I have become cruel and changed my nature, as stated (in Lam. 2:5): <small>THE LORD HAS BECOME LIKE AN ENEMY</small>. It also says (in Is. 63:10): <small>SO HE WAS TURNED INTO THEIR ENEMY</small>. Therefore, Hosea says: Who has brought this about for you? &#x003C; It was &#x003E; because you did not heed him, as stated (in Hos. 9:17): &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>MY GOD</small>] <small>WILL REJECT THEM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HEED HIM</small>. [It is also written] (in Deut. 28:65): <small>AND AMONG THOSE NATIONS YOU SHALL FIND NO PEACE</small>.</p>
<title>10.3 Leviticus 26:3ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 26:3, 4, 14, 19:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES&#x2026;, THEN I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR RAINS IN THEIR SEASON</small>&#x2026;. <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT HEED ME</small>&#x2026;. <small>I WILL MAKE YOUR HEAVENS LIKE IRON</small>. It also says so (in Hag. 1:10): <small>FOR THAT REASON THE HEAVENS OVER YOU HAVE WITHHELD DEW, AND THE EARTH HAS WITHHELD ITS PRODUCE</small>. Because of your sins, the nations are also afflicted. R. Joshua ben Levi said: If the nations had known that, when Israel sinned, they also would be afflicted, they would have raised two armies<sup><xref rid="fn1449">5</xref></sup> in order to keep each and every person of Israel [from sinning.<sup><xref rid="fn1450">6</xref></sup> However, it was not enough for the nations that they were not watching over Israel, but in addition they stopped them from &#x003C; fulfilling &#x003E; the commandments. Thus because Israel sins, all the whole world is afflicted, as stated (in Hag. 1:10): <small>FOR THAT REASON THE HEAVENS OVER YOU HAVE WITHHELD DEW</small>. But if &#x003C; the Israelites &#x003E; do not sin, all the world is blessed on their account, as stated (in Gen. 26:4): <small>AND THROUGH YOUR SEED SHALL ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH BE BLESSED</small>. The Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 20:19&#x2013;20 [22&#x2013;23]): <small>YOU YOURSELVES HAVE SEEN THAT I SPOKE WITH YOU FROM THE HEAVENS. ALONG WITH ME YOU SHALL NOT MAKE GODS OF SILVER, NOR SHALL YOU MAKE FOR YOURSELVES GODS OF GOLD</small>. So if you sin and pray to me, I will not answer you, as stated (in Zech. 7:13): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, AS</small> &#x007B;<small>I</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE</small>] <small>CALLED, AND THEY DID NOT HEED; SO LET THEM CALL, AND I WILL NOT HEED, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. Therefore (according to Exod. 20:20 [23]): <small>ALONG WITH ME YOU SHALL NOT MAKE GODS OF SILVER</small>&#x2026;.]</p>
<title>10.4 Leviticus 26:3ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 1:20): <small>WISDOM SHOUTS FOR JOY IN THE STREET; IN THE SQUARES SHE RAISES HER VOICE</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahman questioned R. Johanan ben Eleazar, when he was standing in the market.<sup><xref rid="fn1451">7</xref></sup> He said to him: recite one chapter (of Mishnah) for me. He said to him: Go to the house of study, and I will recite it for you there. He said to him: Rabbi, did you not teach me (Prov. 1:20): <small>WISDOM SHOUTS FOR JOY IN THE STREET</small>? He said to him: You do not know how to read (Scripture), nor you do know how to recite (Mishnah). What is the meaning of <small>WISDOM SHOUTS FOR JOY IN THE STREET? IN THE STREET</small> of Torah. In the case of a pearl,<sup><xref rid="fn1452">8</xref></sup> where is it sold? In the street (under the daylight). Similarly Torah is <small>IN THE STREET</small> &#x003C; of Torah &#x003E;, where she (i.e., wisdom &#x003E; was said to be. And what is the meaning of (Prov. 1:20, cont.:) <small>IN THE SQUARES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RHB</small></italic>)? In the place where one amplifies (rt.: <italic><small>RHB</small></italic>) it. And where do they amplify it? In the synagogues and in the secondary schools (literally: in the houses of midrash). Therefore it is stated (in Prov. 1:20): <small>IN THE SQUARES SHE RAISES HER VOICE</small>.</p>
<p>(Prov. 1:21:) <small>AT THE HEAD OF THE ROARING HOSTS</small><sup><xref rid="fn1453">9</xref></sup> <small>SHE CALLS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QR</small></italic>&#x2019;). [<small>AT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1454">10</xref></sup> <small>THE HEAD</small> (<italic>R&#x2019;Sh</italic>) <small>OF THE ROARING HOSTS</small> she is the one calling (rt.: <italic><small>QR</small></italic>&#x2019;). How so? From the beginning (rt.: <italic>R&#x2019;Sh</italic>) of Torah how many hosts<sup><xref rid="fn1455">11</xref></sup> does she destroy? The generation of the flood, the generation of the dispersion (i.e., of the Tower of Babel), and the generation of Sodom. Ergo: <small>AT THE HEAD OF THE ROARING HOSTS SHE CALLS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 1:21): <small>AT THE HEAD OF THE ROARING HOSTS</small> (as if from <italic><small>MWT</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1456">12</xref></sup> <small>SHE CALLS. AT THE HEAD</small> of death (<italic><small>MWT</small></italic>) she is calling concerning the first Adam. What is written concerning him (in Gen. 2:17)? <small>FOR ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOU SHALL SURELY DIE</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 1:21): <small>AT THE HEAD OF THE ROARING HOSTS</small> (as if from <italic><small>MWT</small></italic>) <small>SHE CALLS</small>.</p>
<p>(Prov. 1:21, cont.:) <small>IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITY GATES SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>. In the beginning they have made synagogues on the heights of a city, to fulfill what was said (ibid.): <small>IN THE ENTRANCE OF THE CITY GATES SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">13</xref></sup> If you have spoken on matters of Torah, never say: I have already spoken; but speak again; for it is written (ibid.): <small>SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 1:21): <small>SHE SPEAKS HER WORDS</small>. R. Aha said: She speaks what is good and she speaks what is evil. If you do not heed me, (according to Deut. 28:24): <small>THE LORD WILL MAKE THE RAINFALL OF YOUR LAND POWDER &#x003C; AND DUST &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. Here is the evil. She also speaks what is good (in Lev. 26:3): <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>. What is written there (in vs. 4)? <small>THEN I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR RAINS IN THEIR SEASON</small>.]</p>
<title>10.5 Leviticus 26:3ff, Part V</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Lev. 26:3:) <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES</small>. What is written there (in vs. 11)? <small>THEN I WILL SET MY DWELLING PLACE IN YOUR MIDST</small>. If you fulfill my commandments, I will leave the heavenly beings and come down to dwell among you, as stated (in Exod. 29:45): <small>AND I WILL DWELL IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. So they came forth from Egypt on this condition: That they build the dwelling place, so that the Divine Presence might dwell among them, as stated (in vs. 46): <small>AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD THEIR GOD WHO BROUGHT THEM OUT FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT, SO THAT I MIGHT DWELL IN THEIR MIDST</small>. Now if they have done my will, my Divine Presence shall not move from their midst. Why? R. Samuel bar Abba said: The Holy One desired that, just as he has an abode above, so he would have an abode below, for so he said to the first Adam: If you are worthy, just as I am king over the heavenly beings, so I will make you king over the lower beings.<sup><xref rid="fn1458">14</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Gen. 2:15): <small>THEN THE LORD GOD TOOK THE HUMAN BEING &#x003C; AND PUT HIM IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO WORK IT AND PRESERVE IT &#x003E;</small>. Now the word <small>TOOK</small> can only be a word of exaltation, just as you say (in Gen. 12:15): <small>AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">15</xref></sup> And it also says (in Esth. 2:16): <small>SO ESTHER WAS TAKEN UNTO KING AHASUERUS, UNTO HIS ROYAL PALACE</small>. But he (the Holy One) did not do so. Rather, when Adam sinned, he removed his Divine Presence from him. Then when Israel arose, the Holy One said to them: You shall only go forth from Egypt on condition that you make a dwelling place for me, so that my Divine Presence may dwell among you, as stated (in Exod. 25:8): <small>LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &#x003C; THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM &#x003E;</small>. So also he said to Solomon (in I Kings 6:12&#x2013;13): <small>WITH REGARD TO THIS HOUSE WHICH YOU ARE BUILDING, IF YOU WALK IN MY TORAHS</small>, &#x007B;<small>IF YOU</small>&#x007D; <small>CARRY OUT MY ORDINANCES, AND OBSERVE ALL MY COMMANDMENTS TO WALK IN THEM, THEN I WILL</small> &#x007B;<small>ESTABLISH YOU, AS</small>&#x007D; [<small>FULFILL MY WORD WITH YOU, WHICH</small>] <small>I SPOKE UNTO YOUR FATHER DAVID. THEN I WILL DWELL IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND WILL NEVER ABANDON &#x003C; MY PEOPLE ISRAEL &#x003E;</small>. (I Kings 9:6:) <small>IF YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN TURN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING ME</small>&#x2026;, what will I do? (Vs. 7:) <small>THEN I WILL CUT OFF ISRAEL FROM UPON</small> [<small>THE FACE OF</small>] <small>THE LAND WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THEM, AND I WILL CAST</small> &#x007B;<small>THIS HOUSE</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE HOUSE WHICH I HAVE CONSECRATED FOR MY NAME &#x003C; FROM MY PRESENCE &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. ] Why? &#x003C; Because &#x003E; those are &#x003C; the &#x003E; terms which are stated (in Lev. 26:3): <small>IF YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES&#x2026;. THEN I WILL SET MY DWELLING PLACE IN YOUR MIDST</small>&#x2026;. (Vs. 14:) <small>BUT IF YOU DO NOT HEED ME</small>, what is written there (in vs. 31)? <small>THEN I WILL MAKE YOUR SANCTUARIES DESOLATE</small>. What did Solomon do? He had a lot of wives and horses; and it is written (in I Kings 11:4): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS IN SOLOMON&#x2019;S OLD AGE THAT HIS WIVES LED HIS HEART ASTRAY &#x003C; AFTER OTHER GODS &#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to him: I have given you the Torah &#x003C; for you &#x003E; to carry out its commandments, and you have seen the terms which I prescribed to you in it, as stated (in Ps. 72:1): <small>TO SOLOMON. O GOD, GIVE YOUR ORDINANCES TO THE KING, AND YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS TO THE KING&#x2019;S SON</small>. It is also written (in I Kings 11:11): <small>BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN WITH YOU, AND YOU DID NOT KEEP MY COVENANT AND MY STATUTES WHICH I COMMANDED YOU, I WILL SURELY REND THE</small> &#x007B;<small>KINGDOMS</small>&#x007D; [<small>KINGDOM</small>] <small>FROM YOU AND GIVE</small> &#x007B;<small>THEM</small>&#x007D; [<small>IT</small>] <small>TO YOUR SERVANT</small>. So what do I do? (According to Is. 55:11) <small>SO SHALL MY WORD BE WHICH GOES FORTH FROM MY MOUTH: IT SHALL NOT RETURN UNTO ME EMPTY</small>. Manasseh arose to make the image and bring it into the Holy of Holies, as stated (in II Chron. 33:7; cf. II Kings 21:7): <small>AND HE SET UP A SCULPTURED IMAGE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD, OF WHICH GOD HAD SAID UNTO DAVID AND UNTO HIS SON SOLOMON: IN THIS HOUSE AND IN JERUSALEM, WHICH I HAVE CHOSEN OUT OF ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, I SHALL SET MY NAME FOREVER</small>. Then the Holy One called unto Jeremiah and said to him (in Lam. 4:3): <small>EVEN DRAGONS</small><sup><xref rid="fn1460">16</xref></sup> <small>EXTEND A BREAST TO NURSE THEIR YOUNG; &#x003C; THE DAUGHTER OF MY PEOPLE HAS BECOME CRUEL &#x003E;</small>. When the dragon (<italic>tannin</italic>) comes to nurse from its mother, she sees it from afar and extends her breasts for it to nurse; for it would not see her breasts, &#x003C; if &#x003E; covered, and would not nurse. Now my children do not act like this. Instead, when they saw me entering the house, Manasseh came and brought in the image in order to force me out of it. [At<sup><xref rid="fn1461">17</xref></sup> first they made a single face,<sup><xref rid="fn1462">18</xref></sup> and set it up to the west. The Divine Presence went, as it were, to another corner, a place where the image would not be seen. When Manasseh saw that, he made four faces so that the Divine Presence would see them and depart. Thus it is stated (in Is. 28:20): <small>FOR THE COACH IS TOO SHORT FOR STRETCHING OUT, AND THE MOLTEN IMAGE</small><sup><xref rid="fn1463">19</xref></sup> <small>TOO NARROW</small> (<italic>tsar</italic>) <small>FOR CURLING UP</small>.] Also, unlike the dragons (in Lam. 4:3) they did not <small>EXTEND A BREAST TO NURSE THEIR YOUNG</small>. The Holy One said: What am I doing here? (Hos. 5:15:) <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN TO MY PLACE</small>. &#x201C;I will go and return&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN</small>. Now if had been written: &#x201C;I will go and return (to the heavenly abode),&#x201D; there would have been no hope; however, the Holy One said: Although I am going, let him repent, and I will return. It is therefore written: <small>I AM GOING. I WILL RETURN TO MY PLACE, UNTIL THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR GUILT AND SEEK MY FACE. IN THEIR DISTRESS</small> (<italic>tsar</italic>) <small>THEY WILL SEARCH DILIGENTLY FOR ME</small>. Out of the midst of distress, when it comes upon them, they shall repent, and I will restore my Divine Presence. R. Eliezer says: If Israel repents, they will be redeemed; but if Israel does not repent, they will not be redeemed, since it is stated (in Is. 30:15): <small>IN STILLNESS AND CALM YOU SHALL BE SAVED; &#x003C; IN QUIET AND CONFIDENCE SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH. BUT YOU WERE UNWILLING &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1464">20</xref></sup> R. Joshua says: Whether they repent or do not repent, when the end arrives, they will be redeemed immediately, since it is stated (in Is. 60:22): <small>I THE LORD WILL HASTEN IT IN ITS TIME</small>. R. Eleazar said: The Holy One will raise over them someone as evil as Haman. Then he shall enslave them, and for that reason they shall repent, since it is stated (in Is. 59:19): <small>FOR DISTRESS SHALL COME LIKE A STREAM, WITH THE WIND OF THE LORD DRIVING IT ONWARD</small>. At that time (according to vs. 20): <small>THEN A REDEEMER SHALL COME TO ZION AND TO THOSE IN JACOB WHO TURN BACK FROM TRANSGRESSION, SAYS THE LORD</small>&#x2026;. So did R. Tanhuma Berabbi interpret.]</p>
<title>10.6 Leviticus 27:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Lev. 27:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [<small>AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>]: <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS TO THE LORD THE VALUE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>OF HUMAN BEINGS</small> (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>). This text is related (to Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>, [<small>IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>]? The Holy One said: Whoever performs deeds like mine shall be like me.<sup><xref rid="fn1465">21</xref></sup> R. Levi said: &#x003C; The matter &#x003E; is comparable to a king who built a city and lit two lanterns<sup><xref rid="fn1466">22</xref></sup> within it. The king said: When anyone lights two lanterns like these, I will call him Augustus<sup><xref rid="fn1467">23</xref></sup> and not be jealous of him. Similarly, the Holy One created the heavens and set in them [two lanterns, to give light to the world], the sun and the moon, as stated (in Gen. 1:17): <small>AND GOD SET THEM IN THE FIRMAMENT OF THE HEAVENS TO GIVE LIGHT UPON THE EARTH</small>. The Holy One said: Whoever makes &#x003C; lights &#x003E; like these shall be equal to me. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>? These words can only be words &#x003C; referring to &#x003E; light, since it is stated (in Lev. 24:4): <small>HE SHALL SET</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>UP &#x003C; THE LAMPS &#x003E; UPON THE UNALLOYED LAMPSTAND</small>. [Ergo<sup><xref rid="fn1468">24</xref></sup> (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD, IS LIKE THE LORD AMONG THE CHILDREN OF GODS</small>? That is what it is written (in Is. 40:25): <small>THEN UNTO WHOM WILL YOU LIKEN ME THAT I SHOULD BE EQUAL? SAYS THE HOLY ONE</small>. &#x003C; The term &#x003E; <small>HOLY</small> is applied to him just as <small>HOLY</small> is applied to me.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (<italic>ya&#x2018;arok</italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>? R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: Who like you enlightens the eyes of those in the dark, as it is stated (in Lev. 24:4): <small>HE SHALL SET</small> (ya&#x2018;arok) <small>UP &#x003C; THE LAMPS &#x003E; UPON THE UNALLOYED LAMPSTAND</small>&#x2026;?<sup><xref rid="fn1469">25</xref></sup> Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (<italic>ya&#x2018;arok</italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>? R. Abbin said: Who like you clothes the naked, as stated (in Jud. 17:10): <small>A SUIT</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>OF CLOTHES AND YOUR MAINTENANCE</small>? Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? R. Abbin said: Who like you sets battles in order? <small>IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) can only refer to warfare, since it is stated (in Gen. 14:8): <small>AND THEY ENGAGED</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>THEM IN WARFARE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small> (in warfare)?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? R. Abbin said: Who like you feeds the hungry? <small>IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) can only refer to the hungry, since it is stated (in Lev. 24:8&#x2013;9): <small>HE SHALL ARRANGE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>IT</small> (i.e., the shewbread) <small>BEFORE THE LORD REGULARLY ON EVERY SABBATH DAY, AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. AND IT SHALL BELONG TO AARON AND HIS CHILDREN, WHO SHALL EAT IT IN A HOLY PLACE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small> (in feeding the hungry)?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE TO THE LORD</small>? When the Holy One wanted to create Adam, the ministering angels said to the Holy One (in Ps. 8:5 [4]): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM, AND A CHILD OF ADAM THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF HIM</small>? What do you want from this human? The Holy One said to them: Who is to fulfill my Torah and my commandments? They said to him: We will fulfill your Torah. He said to them: You are unable. They<sup><xref rid="fn1470">26</xref></sup> said to him: Why? He said to them: It is written in &#x003C; Torah &#x003E; (in Numb. 19:14): <small>&#x003C; THIS IS THE TORAH: &#x003E; WHEN A PERSON DIES IN HIS TENT</small>, but there are none among you who die. It is written in &#x003C; Torah &#x003E; (in Lev. 12:2): <small>WHEN A WOMAN EMITS HER SEED AND BEARS A MALE</small>, but there are none among you who bear &#x003C; children &#x003E;. It is written in &#x003C; Torah &#x003E; (in Lev. 11:21): <small>THESE YOU MAY EAT</small>, but in your case there is no eating among you. Ergo, the Torah is not going forth to you, as stated (in Job 28:13): <small>NOR IS &#x003C; WISDOM &#x003E; FOUND IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. Rather when the Holy One said to Israel that they should make a tabernacle for him and &#x003C; when &#x003E; they had made it, they began to build the altar of burnt offering, the altar of incense, and to offer sacrifice within it. &#x003C; Then &#x003E; the Holy One began to give them several commandments. These commands concerned every single thing, and they carried them out. The Holy One began to say to the ministering Angels: Who among you would prepare (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) &#x003C; everything &#x003E; for me just as Israel prepares (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) for me? Now you were saying to me (in Ps. 8:5 [4]): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM</small>&#x2026;? They prepare (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) sacrifices for me, just as stated (in Lev. 1:12): <small>AND THE PRIEST SHALL ARRANGE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>THEM</small>. They set (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) tables for me, just as stated (in Lev. 24:8): <small>HE SHALL ARRANGE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>IT</small> (i.e., the shewbread) <small>BEFORE THE LORD REGULARLY ON EVERY SABBATH DAY</small>. They prepare (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) human beings for me, just as stated (in Lev. 27:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS TO THE LORD THE VALUE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<small>RK</small>) <small>OF HUMAN BEINGS</small> (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>). Ergo (in Ps. 89:7 [6]): <small>FOR WHO IN THE SKIES IS COMPARABLE</small> (rt.: <italic>&#x2018;<small>RK</small></italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small> (i.e., is capable of making preparations for the Lord)?]</p>
<title>10.7 Leviticus 27:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Lev. 27:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>&#x2026;. This text is related (to Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE</small>, [<small>BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small> (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>)]. This refers to the Torah, because when one is a Torah scholar (literally: child of Torah), he learns how one acquires lives (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>), as stated (ibid.): <small>BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1471">27</xref></sup> And so you find in the case of Jephthah the Gileadite, because he was not a Torah scholar, he forfeited his daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">28</xref></sup> When? In the time that he fought with the children of Ammon and made a vow, as stated (in Jud. 11:30&#x2013;31): <small>THEN JEPHTHAH MADE A VOW TO THE LORD, &#x003C; AND SAID: IF YOU INDEED GIVE THE CHILDREN OF AMMON INTO MY HAND, &#x003E; THEN IT SHALL BE THAT WHATEVER COMES FORTH</small>&#x2026;, <small>&#x003C; SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD, AND I WILL OFFER IT UP AS A BURNT OFFERING &#x003E;</small>. At that time the Holy One was angry with him. The Holy One said: If there had come out from his house a dog, a pig, or a camel, he would have offered it to me. The Holy One summoned his daughter to him, as stated (in Jud. 11:34&#x2013;35): <small>AND THERE WAS HIS DAUGHTER COMING OUT TO MEET HIM &#x003C;</small>&#x2026;.<small> &#x003E; AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN HE SAW HER, &#x003C; THAT HE RENT HIS CLOTHES&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small> But was not Phinehas there?<sup><xref rid="fn1473">29</xref></sup> Still he said (in vs. 35): <small>AND I CANNOT RETRACT</small>. However, Phinehas had said: I am a high priest and the son of a high priest. Shall I humble myself and go to an ignoramus <italic>&#x2018;am ha&#x2019;arets</italic>)? But Jephthah said: I am head of the tribes of Israel and head of the magistrates. Shall I humble myself and go to a commoner?<sup><xref rid="fn1474">30</xref></sup> Between the two of them that poor woman perished; so the two of them were liable for her blood. In the case of Phinehas, the Holy Spirit left him. In the case of Jephthah, his bones were scattered, as stated (in Jud. 12:7): <small>AND HE WAS BURIED IN THE CITIES OF GILEAD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1475">31</xref></sup> His daughter had said to him: My Father, is it ever written in the Torah: They offer the lives (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>) of their sons upon the alter? And is it not written (in Lev. 1:2): [<small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING TO THE LORD FROM THE CATTLE</small>], <small>&#x003C; YOU SHALL PRESENT YOUR OFFERING &#x003E; FROM THE HERD OR FROM THE FLOCK</small>, &#x003C; i.e., &#x003E; from the cattle and not from the children of Adam? He said to her: My daughter, I made a vow (in Jud. 11:31): <small>THEN IT SHALL BE THAT WHATEVER COMES FORTH</small>&#x2026;. [She said to him:] When our father Jacob made a vow (in Gen. 28:22): <small>AND OF ALL THAT YOU GIVE ME, I WILL SURELY SET ASIDE A TITHE FOR YOU</small>, and when the Holy One gave him twelve tribes, did he ever offer up one of them as a sacrifice? [Moreover, does not Hannah &#x003C; do likewise &#x003E;, when she makes a vow and says (in I Sam. 1:11): <small>THEN I WILL GIVE HIM TO THE LORD ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE</small>. Did she ever offer up her son as a sacrifice to the Holy One?] All these things she said to him, but he did not heed her. She said to him: Let me go to a court of law. Perhaps one of them will find a loophole for your words. Thus it is stated (in Jud. 11:37): <small>LEAVE ME ALONE FOR TWO MONTHS</small>, [<small>SO THAT I MAY GO AND COME DOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS</small>]. R. Levi ben Berekhyah said: Is there anyone who comes down to the mountains? Does not one go up to the mountains? So what is the meaning of <small>AND COME DOWN TO THE MOUNTAINS</small>? These represent the Sanhedrin,<sup><xref rid="fn1476">32</xref></sup> as in the usage (of Micah 6:2): <small>HEAR, O MOUNTAINS, THE LAWSUIT OF THE LORD</small>. [She<sup><xref rid="fn1477">33</xref></sup> went to them, but they did not find a loophole for undoing his vow. So it is with reference to him that the Scripture has said (in Prov. 28:3): <small>A POOR MAN WHO EXPLOITS THE INDIGENT IS A TORRENTIAL RAIN WHICH LEAVES NO BREAD. A POOR MAN</small>: This is Jephthah, since he was poor in the Torah. He was a &#x003C; mere &#x003E; sycamore shoot.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">34</xref></sup> (Prov. 28:3, cont.:) <small>WHO EXPLOITS THE INDIGENT</small>, since he exploited the indigent, when he said (in Jud. 12:6): <small>SAY: <italic>SHIBBOLETH</italic>; AND HE SAID</small> <italic><small>SIBBOLETH</small></italic>. Then he slaughtered him. Therefore, he is (according to Prov. 28:3, cont.) <small>A TORRENTIAL RAIN, AND THERE IS NO BREAD</small>, in that he had someone who would undo his vow; however (ibid., cont.): <small>THERE IS NO BREAD</small>, in that the Holy One had taken away the halakhah from them, so that they would not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow. When they did not find [a loophole] for undoing his vow, he went up and slaughtered her before the Holy One. Then the Holy Spirit proclaimed: Did I desire you to sacrifice lives (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>) to me, &#x003C; lives &#x003E; (according to Jer. 19:5), <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED, NEVER SPOKE FOR, AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND. WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Abraham, that he slaughter his son. Instead I said to him (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>&#x2026;. &#x003C; It was &#x003E; in order to make known to you how Abraham carried out my will, when the nations of the world were saying: Why does the Holy One love Abraham so much? For that reason he said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>&#x2026;. Ergo (in Jer. 19:5): <small>WHICH I NEVER COMMANDED</small> Abraham, certainly not to slaughter his son, <small>NEVER SPOKE FOR</small> to Jephthah to offer up his daughter as a sacrifice to me, <small>AND WHICH NEVER ENTERED MY MIND</small>, that the king of Moab would fall into the hand of the King of Israel and offer up his firstborn son to me as a sacrifice, as stated (in II Kings 3:27): <small>SO HE TOOK HIS FIRSTBORN SON, WHO WOULD BECOME KING IN HIS STEAD, AND OFFERED HIM UP AS A BURNT OFFERING UPON THE WALL</small>.] Who caused Jephthah to forfeit his daughter? &#x003C; He himself &#x003E; because he had not studied the Torah; for if he had studied the Torah, he would not had forfeited his daughter, since it is written (in Lev. 27:2, 4): <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS &#x003C; TO THE LORD THE VALUE OF HUMAN BEINGS</small> (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>)<small> &#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. <small>AND IF IT IS A FEMALE &#x003C; &#x2026;. &#x003E;</small> Ergo (in Prov. 11:30): <small>THE FRUIT OF THE RIGHTEOUS IS A TREE OF LIFE, &#x003C; BUT A WISE PERSON ACQUIRES LIVES</small> (<italic><small>NPShWT</small></italic>) <small> &#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>10.8 Leviticus 27:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Lev. 27:2:) <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>. The nations say (in Micah 6:6&#x2013;7): <small>WITH WHAT SHALL I COME BEFORE THE LORD, BOW MYSELF BEFORE GOD ON HIGH</small>? [&#x2026;.] <small>DOES THE LORD WANT THOUSANDS OF RAMS</small> [&#x2026;? <small>SHALL I GIVE MY FIRSTBORN FOR MY TRANSGRESSION, THE FRUIT OF MY BELLY FOR THE SIN OF MY SOUL</small>?] The Holy One said to them: Do you want to offer your children to me? Neither your children nor your sacrifices do I want. For my children I have given a parashah on values (in Lev. 27:1&#x2013;8) and a parashah on sacrifices, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; which of your offerings are acceptable to me (in Lev. 1). And so it says (in Ps. 37:16): <small>BETTER IS THE LITTLE THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE HAS</small>. You yourself know what is at the beginning of the book (in Lev. 1:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, [<small>AND SAY UNTO THEM</small>]: <small>WHEN ONE OF YOU PRESENTS AN OFFERING</small>, &#x003C; i.e. &#x003E; <small>OF YOU</small>, and not &#x201C;of the nations.&#x201D; Then at the end of the book &#x003C; one finds &#x003E; (in Lev. 27:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS</small>&#x2026;. It also says (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said to Israel: If you bring before me your value equivalents, I will ascribe it to you as if you had offered up your lives before me. It is therefore stated (in Lev. 27:2): <small>WHEN ANYONE EXPLICITLY VOWS TO THE LORD THE VALUE OF HUMAN BEINGS</small>&#x2026;. The Holy One said: By virtue of the value equivalents (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) I am saving you from the &#x003C; fiery &#x003E; preparation (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) of Gehinnom,<sup><xref rid="fn1479">35</xref></sup> as he has written about it (in Is. 30:33): <small>FOR TOPHETH HAS BEEN PREPARED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RK</small></italic>) <small>FROM OF OLD</small>; and I will prepare a table before you, just as David has stated (in Ps. 23:5): <small>YOU PREPARE A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES; YOU ANOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP OVERFLOWS</small>.</p>
