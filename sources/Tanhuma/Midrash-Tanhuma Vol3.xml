<title>Chapter 1 Numbers, Parashah I: <italic>Bemidbar</italic></title>
<title>Numbers 1:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 1:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT, IN THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS; YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. R. Meir said: &#x003C;The passage&#x003E; is speaking allegorically about the righteous in their dwelling, and it is speaking allegorically about the wicked in their dwelling.<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> It is speaking allegorically about the righteous &#x003C;in their dwelling&#x003E; (in Ezek. 34:14): <small>I WILL FEED THEM IN A GOOD PASTURE</small>, &#x007B;<small>AND IN A PASTURE OF OIL</small>&#x007D; [<small>AND UPON THE MOUNTAINS OF THE LOFTY ONE OF ISRAEL</small>] <small>SHALL BE THEIR FOLD</small>. It speaks allegorically about the wicked &#x003C;in their dwelling&#x003E; (in Ezek. 31:15): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D;: <small>IN THE DAY THAT HE WENT DOWN TO SHEOL, I CAUSED HIM TO MOURN; I COVERED HIM WITH THE DEEP</small>. With what are the wicked covered, when they go down to Gehinnom?<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> <small>WITH THE DEEP</small>. Hezekiah bar Hiyya said: In the case of a vat, with what does one cover it? With a lid of clay, since &#x003C;the vessel itself &#x003E; is &#x003C;made&#x003E; of clay. For that reason one covers it with a lid of clay. Similarly in the case of the wicked, it is written of them (in Is. 29:15): <small>AND THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>. For that reason they are darkened before the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> So he brings them down to Sheol, which is darkness, and covers them with the deep, which is darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 36:7 [6]): <small>YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS IS LIKE THE MIGHTY MOUNTAINS</small> (literally: <small>MOUNTAINS OF GOD</small>). The righteousness which the Holy One brings into the world is proclaimed upon these mountains. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR JUDGMENTS ARE LIKE THE GREAT DEEP</small>. A judgment which you execute for the world is like the great deep. As the deep is in a secret &#x003C;place&#x003E;, your judgments are also in secret. How so? When Jerusalem was destroyed, it was destroyed on the ninth of Ab; but when it was shown to Ezekiel, it seemed to be on the tenth.<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> Why? So as not to publicize<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> it. However, when he came to magnify Israel, he did publicize [on which day], in which place, in which month, in which year &#x007B;in the second year&#x007D;, in which era.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> &#x007B;The abyss.&#x007D; [On which day? (Numb. 1:1:) <small>ON THE FIRST OF THE MONTH</small>. In which place? (Ibid.:) <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. In which month? (Ibid.:) <small>IN THE SECOND MONTH</small>. In which year? (Ibid.:) <small>IN THE SECOND YEAR</small>. In which era?] (Ibid.:) <small>AFTER THEIR EXODUS FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT, SAYING</small>. What did he say to them? (Numb. 1:2:) <small>TAKE A CENSUS</small>.</p>
<title>1.2 Numbers 1:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 1:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 2:31): 0 <small>GENERATION, UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF THE LORD</small>: [<small>HAVE I BEEN A DESERT FOR ISRAEL &#x003C;OR A LAND OF THICK DARKNESS&#x003E;</small>?] The Holy One said to Israel: Because you said to Moses (in Numb. 20:5 &#x003D; 21:5): <small>WHY DID YOU BRING US UP FROM</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LAND OF</small>&#x007D; <small>EGYPT &#x003C;TO DIE IN THE DESERT? FOR THERE IS NO BREAD AND NO WATER&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> (Jer. 2:31:) <small>HAVE I BEEN A DESERT FOR ISRAEL</small>? Did I act like a desert to you? Is it customary for a king of flesh and blood, when he leaves for the desert, [to find] easy living [there] just like that which he had found in his palace,<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> either &#x003C;palace&#x003E; food or &#x003C;palace&#x003E; drink? However, when you were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and when I brought you out from there, I had you lie down under clouds of glory and raised up three redeemers for you to serve you, [as stated] (in (Micah 6:4): <small>AND I SENT MOSES, AARON, AND MIRIAM BEFORE YOU</small>. [Through the merit of Moses you ate manna, &#x003C;a food&#x003E; which &#x003C;even&#x003E; the holy ancestors had not seen, as stated (in Deut. 8:3): <small>SO HE AFFLICTED YOU WITH HUNGER BUT FED YOU WITH MANNA, &#x003C;WHICH NEITHER YOU HAD KNOWN NOR HAD YOUR ANCESTORS KNOWN&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Through the merit of Aaron I surrounded you in clouds of glory, as stated (in Ps. 105:39): <small>HE SPREAD A CLOUD FOR A COVER AND A FIRE TO GIVE LIGHT AT NIGHT</small>. There were seven clouds: one from above, one from below, one from each of the four winds, and one before you. He smote snakes and scorpions, leveled the mountains and valleys for them, and burned the thornbushes so that they sent up smoke. When all the kings of the East and West saw this, the peoples of the world said (in Cant. 3:6): <small>WHO IS THIS THAT COMES UP FROM THE DESERT LIKE COLUMNS OF SMOKE</small>? It is also written (in Deut. 29:4): <small>I LED YOU FORTY YEARS IN THE DESERT</small>; [<small>YOUR CLOTHES DID NOT WEAR OUT&#x2026;</small>.] In the case of a baby, all the time that it was growing, its garments and clothes were growing along with it. Now the well &#x003C;came&#x003E; through the merit of Miriam, who uttered a song by the waters &#x003C;of the Reed Sea&#x003E;.:<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of R. Levi: &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who has a province. So he sends high ranking people into its midst to conduct their affairs and and administer their justice. Who has to be responsible for their maintenance? Do not the people of the province have to be responsible for their maintenance? But the Holy One did not act like that. Instead he sent out Moses, Aaron, [and Miriam], as stated (in Micah 6:4): <small>AND I SENT MOSES, AARON, AND MIRIAM BEFORE YOU</small>. Thus through their merit, Israel was sustained. The manna was through the merit of Moses. [You yourself know that it is so. When Moses passed away, what is written (in Josh. 5:12)? <small>THE MANNA CEASED ON THE NEXT DAY</small> (i.e., the day after Moses died).]<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> The clouds of glory &#x003C;came&#x003E; through the merit of Aaron. You yourself know that it is so. When Aaron passed away, what is written (in Numb. 21:4)? <small>BUT THE TEMPER OF THE PEOPLE GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>, because the sun was shining down upon them (without a cloud cover). And the well &#x003C;came&#x003E; through the merit of Miriam,<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> since it is stated (in Numb. 20:1-2): <small>BUT MIRIAM DIED THERE &#x003C;AND WAS BURIED THERE&#x003E;. NOW THE CONGREGATION HAD NO WATER</small>. And how was [the well] constructed? Like a kind of rock. It rolled along and came with them on the journeys.<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> When the standards &#x003C;for each tribe&#x003E; came to rest and the Tabernacle arose, the rock would come and settle down in the court of the Tent of Meeting. Then the princes would stand beside it and say (in the words of Numb. 21:17): <small>RISE UP, O WELL</small>; and the well would rise up. After that, I brought them quails (cf. Numb. 11:31). (Jer. 2:31:) <small>HAVE I BEEN A DESERT FOR ISRAEL</small>? Have I treated you like a desert? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR A LAND OF UTTER DARKNESS</small>. Did not I become a light for you a light by myself? It is so stated (in Exod. 13:21:) <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Jer. 2:31): <small>UTTER DARKNESS</small>. Have I &#x003C;ever&#x003E; said to you that I am bringing a benefit and delayed it? <small>UTTER DARKNESS</small> (rt.:&#x2019;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>) can only be a term of delay, as it is used (in Exod. 9:32): <small>&#x003C;BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT&#x003E; BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small> (i.e., <small>ARE DELAYED</small>: rt.:&#x2019;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> &#x007B;R.&#x007D; Joshua said (in Josh. 21:43 [45]; cf. 23:14): <small>NOT A</small> &#x007B;<small>SINGLE</small>&#x007D; <small>THING HAS FAILED</small> (<italic><small>NPL</small></italic>) <small>OF ANY GOOD THING</small> &#x007B;<small>OF HIS</small>&#x007D; <small>WHICH THE LORD PROMISED UNTO THE</small> &#x007B;<small>CHILDREN</small>&#x007D; [<small>HOUSE</small>] <small>OF ISRAEL; IT ALL CAME TO PASS</small>. &#x003C;Therefore&#x003E; (in Jer. 2:31:) <small>WHY DID MY PEOPLE SAY</small>: <italic><small>RADNU</small></italic> (rt.: <italic><small>RWD</small></italic>); <small>&#x003C;WE WILL NOT COME UNTO YOU ANY MORE&#x003E;</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> The word is Mishnaic (as in <italic>Ter</italic>. 10:3 &#x003D; <italic>Makhsh.</italic> 3:3): <small>ONE WHO REMOVES</small> (<small>RWDH</small>) <small>A HOT LOAF</small> (adhering to an oven).<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> They (i.e., Israel) said: When the bread is baked in the oven and is taken out of it, can it stick<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> to the oven again? Now we in Jerusalem were as in an oven (since it is stated in Is. 31:9): <small>SAYS THE LORD, WHO HAS A FIRE IN ZION AND HAS AN OVEN IN JERUSALEM</small>. Now you exiled us to Babylon. What do you still want from us? (Jer. 2:31:) <small>WHY DID MY PEOPLE SAY</small>: <italic><small>RADNU</small></italic> (i.e., He has &#x003C;already&#x003E; removed us (<italic>radanu</italic>) &#x003C;once from oven of Jerusalem&#x003E;)?</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Jer. 2:31): <small>WHY DID MY PEOPLE SAY</small>: <italic><small>RADNU</small></italic>; <small>&#x003C;WE WILL NOT COME UNTO YOU ANY MORE&#x003E;</small>? What is the meaning of <italic><small>RADNU</small></italic> (rt.: <italic><small>RWD</small></italic>)]? Compare what is said (in I Kings 5:4 [4:24]): <small>FOR HE HAD DOMINION</small> (<italic><small>RWDH</small></italic> (as if from <italic><small>RDH</small></italic>) <small>OVER EVERYTHING BEYOND THE RIVER</small> (i.e., west of the Euphrates). They said to &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E;: You have given us<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> the Sanctuary, but you have taken away your Divine Presence from us. Now what do you still want from us? (Jer. 2:31) <small>&#x003C;WHY DID MY PEOPLE SAY: HE HAS DOMINION OVER US</small> (<italic>RADNU</italic>)<small>&#x003E;; WE WILL NOT COME UNTO YOU ANY MORE</small>? He said to them: Would that &#x003C;I&#x003E; were, as stated (in Jer. 9:1 [2]): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>WOULD THAT I WERE IN THE DESERT, AT AN INN FOR WAYFARERS, &#x003C;THAT I MIGHT LEAVE MY PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. Where? Where I was praised,<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> as stated (in Is. 42:11-12): <small>LET THE DESERT AND ITS CITIES LIFT UP &#x003C;THEIR VOICE&#x003E;</small>[&#x2026; <small>LET THEM GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD AND DECLARE HIS PRAISE IN THE ISLANDS</small>]. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a prince who entered a metropolis. When the inhabitants of the metropolis saw him, they fled. He entered a second one, and &#x003C;again&#x003E; they fled from him. He entered into another city &#x007B;and destroyed it&#x007D; [that was ruined (<italic>harevah</italic>)]; and when the inhabitants saw him, they praised him. That prince said: This city is better than all the metropolises. Here I will build myself a lodging place<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup>; here I will dwell. Similarly, when the Holy One came to the sea, it fled from him, as stated (in Ps. 114:3): <small>THE SEA SAW &#x003C;HIM&#x003E; AND FLED</small>. When he came to the desert wasteland (<italic>harevah</italic>), they praised him, as stated (in Is. 42:11): <small>LET THE DESERT AND ITS CITIES LIFT UP &#x003C;THEIR VOICE&#x003E;</small>[&#x2026;. He said: This city is better. Here I will build a lodging place. When he came down into its midst, they began rejoicing, because the Holy One was dwelling in their midst, as stated (in Is. 35:1): <small>THE DESERT AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>, [<small>AND THE WILDERNESS SHALL REJOICE AND BLOSSOM LIKE A CROCUS</small>].</p>
<title>1.3 Numbers 1:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 1:1:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT, IN THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. Before the Tent of Meeting was set up, he spoke with him in the bush, as stated (in Exod. 3:2): <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>CALLED</small>&#x007D; [<small>APPEARED</small>] <small>UNTO HIM IN A FLAME OF FIRE FROM THE MIDST OF A BUSH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> [After that he spoke with him in Midian, as stated (in Exod. 4:19): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES IN MIDIAN</small>.] After that he spoke with him in Egypt, as stated (in Exod. 12:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. After that he spoke with him in Sinai, as stated (in Lev. 25:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES ON MOUNT SINAI</small>. When the Tent of Meeting was set up, he said: Humility is beautiful, as stated (in Micah 6:8): <small>&#x003C;HE HAS TOLD YOU, O HUMAN, WHAT IS GOOD&#x2026;,&#x003E; AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH</small> &#x007B;<small>THE LORD</small>&#x007D; <small>YOUR GOD</small>. He began to speak with him in the Tent of Meeting. Likewise David also says (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING&#x2019;S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>; [<small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>]. <small>THE KING&#x2019;S DAUGHTER</small>: This &#x003C;king&#x003E; is Moses, as stated (in Is. 19:4): <small>AND I WILL DELIVER THE EGYPTIANS INTO THE HAND OF A HARSH LORD</small>. These<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> are the plagues which came upon the Egyptians. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND A STRONG KING SHALL RULE OVER THEM</small>. This is Moses, who was king of Torah, which is called <small>STRENGTH</small>, where it is stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>ALL GLORIOUS IS THE KING&#x2019;S DAUGHTER WITHIN</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>. This is Aaron, since it is stated (in Exod. 28:13): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE A GOLD BROCADE</small>. Hence, our masters have said: Every bride who conceals herself (because of humility, i.e., modesty), even though she be an &#x003C;ordinary&#x003E; Israelite woman, is worthy of being married to a priest and to raise up high priests, since it is stated (in Ps. 45:14 [13]): <small>HER CLOTHING IS OF GOLD BROCADE</small>. The Holy One said: Likewise it befits him to speak from within, as stated (in Numb. 7:89): [<small>WHEN</small><sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> <small>MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH HIM, HE WOULD HEAR THE VOICE SPEAKING UNTO HIM</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: If the people of the world had known how auspicious the Temple was for them, they would have surrounded it with military encampments<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> in order to protect it,<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> since it was more auspicious for them than for any of Israel; for thus did Solomon set forth in his prayer (in II Chron. 6:32-33 // I Kings 8:41-42):<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> <small>AND LIKEWISE</small>, &#x007B;<small>IN THE CASE OF</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THE FOREIGNER, WHO IS NOT OF YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL AND COMES FROM A DISTANT LAND FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR GREAT NAME, YOUR MIGHTY HAND, AND YOUR OUTSTRETCHED ARM, IF</small> &#x007B;<small>HE COMES</small>&#x007D; [<small>THEY COME</small>] <small>UNTO THIS HOUSE TO PRAY, MAY YOU HEARKEN &#x003C;UNTO HIM&#x003E; FROM HEAVEN, EVEN FROM THE PLACE WHERE YOU DWELL, AND DO ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THE FOREIGNER CRIES OUT UNTO YOU, IN ORDER THAT ALL THE PEOPLES OF THE EARTH MAY KNOW YOUR NAME</small> [<small>AND</small>] <small>FEAR YOU, AS DO YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, AND THAT THEY MAY KNOW THAT YOUR NAME IS CALLED UPON IN THIS HOUSE WHICH I HAVE BUILT</small>. But when he comes to Israel, what is written (in II Chron. 6:30 &#x003D; I Kings 8:39)? <small>AND YOU SHALL GIVE TO EACH ONE ACCORDING TO ALL HIS WAYS, SINCE YOU KNOW HIS HEART</small>. Solomon said: Sovereign of the Universe, if he is worthy, give to him; if he is not worthy, do not give to him. Moreover, you should not &#x003C;only&#x003E; say that the temple &#x003C;was auspicious for them&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> In fact, if it had not been for Israel, no rain would ever have come down<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> nor would the sun have shown; for it was through their merit that the Holy One brought relief to the world. Also in the world to come, when the peoples of the world shall see, in the case of Israel, how the Holy One is with them, they shall come to join them, as stated (in Zech. 8:23): <small>IN THOSE DAYS WHEN TEN PEOPLE FROM ALL THE LANGUAGES OF THE NATIONS TAKE HOLD, THEY SHALL TAKE HOLD OF THE SKIRT OF A JEWISH PERSON</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>LET US GO WITH YOU FOR WE HAVE HEARD THAT GOD IS WITH YOU</small>.</p>
<title>1.4 Numbers 1:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1-2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small> [&#x2026;: <small>TAKE A CENSUS OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 7:3 [2]): <small>YOUR NAVEL IS A ROUND BOWL. LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING. YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT FENCED IN WITH LILIES</small>. &#x003C;The verse&#x003E; is speaking about the Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> of Israel, which was situated in the Chamber of Hewn Stone and is compared with a navel.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> And why is it compared with a navel? It is simply that just as the navel is situated in the middle of the body, so the Sanhedrin of Israel was situated in the middle of the Temple. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>? That there was never one less than a third of them &#x003C;present&#x003E;. <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. Whoever mixes it properly mixes a third of a cup of wine with two parts water. Thus the Sanhedrin would sit from &#x003C;the time of&#x003E; the morning sacrifice until the sacrifice at twilight. But did not one of them turn away for the needs of nature? So what did they do when one wanted to leave? He would count. If twenty three were present, he would leave; if not, he would not leave. Why? Because it is written (ibid.): <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. Thus there was never less than a third of them &#x003C;present&#x003E;. It is therefore written: <small>LET NOT MIXED WINE BE LACKING</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. Israel has been compared with a heap of wheat.<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> Just as this wheat enters the granary with a count (<italic>minyan</italic>) and leaves with a count, so the Holy One said that Israel should be numbered (<italic>nimnin</italic>) all the time. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. The stubble and the straw, however, are not numbered. Instead they are measured.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> Thus the peoples of the world are compared with stubble and straw, as stated (in Ps. 35:5): <small>THEY SHALL BE LIKE CHAFF BEFORE THE WIND WITH THE ANGEL OF THE LORD OVERTHROWING THEM</small>. And so it says (in Obad. 18): <small>AND THE HOUSE OF ESAU SHALL BE STRAW</small>. And why? Because they have<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> no pleasure from them, as stated (in Is. 40:17): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM; THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY HIM AS LESS THAN NOTHING AND VOID</small>. But in the case of Israel, the Holy One does have pleasure from them. They read the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018;, pray, and bless the name of the Holy One every day; therefore, they are numbered all the time. For that reason they were compared with the wheat, as stated (in Cant. 7:3) <small>YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT</small>. For that reason (in Numb. 1:1-2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT&#x2026;: TAKE A CENSUS OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.5 Numbers 1:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1-2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 147:20): <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION&#x2026;</small>., and also (to Ps. 148:14): <small>HE HAS RAISED UP A HORN FOR HIS PEOPLE, PRAISE FOR ALL HIS SAINTS</small>. &#x003C;The situation&#x003E; is comparable to a king who took &#x003C;his&#x003E; first wife and did not write her a marriage contract.<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> He divorced her and did not give her a bill of divorce. He did the same for the second and for the third, in that he did not write them either a marriage contract or a bill of divorce. &#x007B;He did not act. However,&#x007D; [In due time] when he saw a certain poor orphan, a woman of noble ancestry, he wanted to marry her. He said to his <italic>shoshevin</italic> (i.e., to his best man): Do not behave with her as with the previous ones. This is a woman of noble ancestry. She is modest in her actions and worthy. Write her a marriage contract &#x003C;stating&#x003E; in which week, in which year, in which month, on what day of the month, in which province,<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> just as it is written in Esther (2:16): <small>SO ESTHER WAS TAKEN UNTO KING AHASUERUS, UNTO HIS ROYAL PALACE IN THE TENTH MONTH, WHICH IS THE MONTH OF TEBETH, IN THE SEVENTH YEAR OF HIS REIGN</small>. Thus the Omnipotent created the generation of the flood and did not write down when he created them. He removed them from the world and did not write down when he removed them. It is simply &#x003C;stated&#x003E; (in Gen. 7:11): <small>ON THAT DAY ALL THE SPRINGS OF THE GREAT ABYSS BURST FORTH AND THE WINDOWS OF THE HEAVENS WERE OPENED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> Moreover, it was similar for the generation of the dispersion (Gen. 10:1-9); [similar for the Sodomites;] and similar for the Egyptians. For them it is not written either when they were created or when they died. &#x007B;He did not act. However,&#x007D; When Israel arose, the Holy One said to Moses: I will not behave with these as with those previous ones. These are people of noble ancestry, descendants from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is there written for them in which month, on what day of the month, in which year, in which province, in which metropolis I raised up their horn and gave them a head held high. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 1:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>, i.e., the province, <small>IN THE TENT OF MEETING</small>, i.e., the metropolis.

<title>1.6 Numbers 1:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES</small>. &#x003C;How&#x003E; blessed was Moses&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> Six hundred thousand were present with the priests, the Levites, and the elders. They were were all present there; yet out of them all, he only spoke there with Moses, as stated (ibid.:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. Why <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> From here our masters have taught: The Torah was given through three things: through fire, through water, and through the desert.<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> Where is it shown &#x003C;that it was given&#x003E; through fire? Where it is stated (in Exod. 19:18): <small>NOW ALL OF MOUNT SINAI WAS EMITTING SMOKE BECAUSE THE LORD HAD DESCENDED UPON IT IN FIRE. AND THE SMOKE FROM IT AROSE LIKE SMOKE FROM A FURNACE, AND THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN TREMBLED GREATLY</small>. Where is it shown &#x003C;that it was given&#x003E; through water? Where it is stated (in Jud. 5:4): <small>LORD, WHEN YOU WENT FORTH FROM SEIR, WHEN YOU MARCHED FROM THE FIELD OF EDOM, THE EARTH TREMBLED, EVEN THE HEAVENS DRIPPED, EVEN THE CLOUDS DROPPED WATER</small>. Where is it shown &#x003C;that it was given&#x003E; through (i.e., in)<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> the desert? Where it is stated (in Numb. 1:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. And why was it given through these three things. It is simply that, as these are free for all who come into the world, so the words of the Torah are free. Thus it is stated (in Is. 55:1): <small>HO, ALL WHO ARE THIRSTY, COME TO THE WATERS</small> (of Torah); <small>EVEN IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY, COME, BUY FOOD, AND EAT. SO COME, BUY FOOD, WINE, AND MILK WITHOUT MONEY AND WITHOUT COST</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why (according to Numb. 1:1) <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>? It is simply that whoever does not make himself ownerless like the desert cannot acquire<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> It is therefore stated: <small>IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>.</p>
<title>1.7 Numbers 1:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT</small>. &#x003C;Sinai&#x003E; was called by six names: Mountain of God (as in Ps. 68:16 [15]), Mount Bashan (ibid.), mountain of peaks (ibid.), mountain of desire (<italic><small>HMD</small></italic>), Mount Horeb (Exod. 3:1; 33:6; etc.), Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> The mountain of God is &#x003C;so called&#x003E; because on it God sat in judgment, as stated (in Exod. 21:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE JUDGMENTS</small><sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> <small>WHICH YOU SHALL SET BEFORE THEM</small>. Mount Bashan is the mountain where (<italic>sham</italic>) Holy One came (<italic>ba</italic>&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> The mountain of peaks (<italic>gavenunnim,</italic> rt.: <italic><small>GBN</small></italic>) is the mountain where he carved out and rejected<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; mountains.<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> Where is it shown? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; just as you say (in Lev. 21:20): <small>OR A HUNCHBACK</small> (<italic><small>GBN</small></italic>) <small>OR A DWARF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> The mountain of desire (rt.: <italic><small>HMD</small></italic>) is &#x003C;so called&#x003E;, because on it the Holy One desired (<italic><small>HMD</small></italic>) to dwell, as stated (in Ps. 68:17 [16]): <small>THE MOUNTAIN GOD DESIRED FOR HIS DWELLING</small>. Mount Horeb (rt.: <italic><small>HRB</small></italic>) is &#x003C;so called&#x003E;, because upon it the sword (rt.: <italic><small>HRB</small></italic>) &#x003C;of judgment&#x003E; was unsheathed, as stated (in Lev. 20:10): <small>THE ADULTERER AND THE ADULTERESS SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>, &#x003C;and&#x003E; (in Numb. 35:16): <small>THE MURDERER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Mount Sinai is &#x003C;so called&#x003E;, because on it the peoples of the world became hateful (rt.: <italic><small>SN</small></italic>&#x2019;) to the Holy One, and he rendered a verdict<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> against them, as stated (in Is. 60:12): <small>AND THE GENTILES SHALL BE UTTERLY</small> (<italic><small>HRB</small></italic>) <small>DESTROYED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HRB</small></italic>). R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R.

<title>1.8 Numbers 1:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 1:1): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT&#x2026;</small>. What did he say to him (in vs. 2)?<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> <small>TAKE A CENSUS</small> (literally: <small>RAISE</small> [rt.: <italic><small>NS</small></italic>&#x2019;] <small>THE HEAD</small>) <small>OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: I have not cherished &#x003C;any&#x003E; creation more than you; therefore I have given you a head held high and have likened you to me. Thus just as I have a head held higher than all that come into the world, as stated (in I Chron. 29:11): <small>TO YOU, O LORD, BELONG THE GREATNESS, THE MIGHT, THE SPLENDOR, THE TRIUMPH, AND THE MAJESTY; FOR ALL THAT IS IN THE HEAVENS AND IN THE EARTH IS YOURS; &#x003C;YOURS&#x003E; IS THE KINGDOM, O LORD, AND &#x003C;YOU&#x003E; ARE EXALTED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NS</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>AS HEAD OVER ALL</small>; so I have also done for you, for you to have a head held high. It was therefore stated (in Numb. 1:1): <small>RAISE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NS</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>THE HEAD OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;This exaltation was&#x003E; to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 148:14): <small>HE HAS RAISED UP A HORN FOR HIS PEOPLE, PRAISE FOR ALL HIS SAINTS, EVEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, A PEOPLE NEAR TO HIM. HALLELUJAH</small>. And so it says (in Deut. 28:1): <small>AND THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL SET YOU HIGH OVER ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH</small>.</p>
<title>1.9 Numbers 2:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 2:1-2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL CAMP,&#x003E; EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES&#x2026;</small>. Let our master instruct us: Within how many cubits is it permitted for one to walk on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught: One who observes the Sabbath on the road makes a circle with a radius of four cubits for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> &#x003C;These are&#x003E; the words of R. Haninya ben Antigonus. Then he moves &#x003C;objects&#x003E; on the Sabbath &#x003C;to&#x003E; within within four cubits and says: My Sabbath rest is in this place where I am. So his place gives him the right &#x003C;to go&#x003E; two thousand cubits in any direction. But how much are four cubits? R. Judah says: Enough for him to take a cask from his feet and put it by his headrest. And one who keeps the Sabbath in a city, even though it is as large as Antioch, may walk all of it, its outskirts, and two thousand cubits beyond its outskirts.<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> What is the meaning of &#x201C;outskirts&#x201D;? The shops and the inns<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> which are on the road outside the city. And the one who keeps the Sabbath in a cave, even though it is as large as the cave where king Zedekiah of Judah fled,<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> which was twelve miles<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> long,<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> may walk all of it and outside of it for two thousand cubits in any direction he wishes. And from where did the sages find support? From the words of Torah, [where it is stated] (in Numb. 35:5): <small>AND YOU SHALL MEASURE OFF TWO THOUSAND CUBITS OUTSIDE THE TOWN ON THE EAST SIDE&#x2026;</small>. And likewise you find in the case of Joshua, when he went to destroy Jericho, Joshua said to them (i.e., to Israel): You are going to keep the Sabbath there. Do not go further than two thousand cubits from the ark in any direction. Why? So that you may be entitled to come to pray before the ark on the Sabbath. And so it says (in Joshua 3:4): <small>YET THERE SHALL BE A DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND IT</small> (the Ark of the Covenant) <small>OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CUBITS BY MEASURE</small>. And likewise you find, when God told Moses that he should have Israel encamp under standards, he said to him: Have them encamp under their standards in every direction. Where is it shown? From what is they read on the matter (in Numb. 2:2): <small>&#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E; SHALL CAMP, EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE; &#x003C;THEY SHALL CAMP AROUND THE TENT OF MEETING AT A DISTANCES&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup></p>

This text is related (to Ps. 20:6 [5]): <small>LET US SHOUT FOR JOY IN YOUR SALVATION, AND IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LET US SET UP OUR STANDARDS&#x2026;</small>. Israel said: Lord God, we are shouting for joy <small>IN <italic>YOUR</italic> SALVATION</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> which you have brought about for us in your name. (Ibid.:) <small>LET US SHOUT FOR JOY IN <italic>YOUR</italic> SALVATION</small>.

Israel, as it were, was redeemed; and like them God was redeemed. (Ps. 20:6 [5], cont.:) <small>AND IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LET US SET UP OUR STANDARDS</small>, for God has inserted his name]<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> among our names<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> and has appointed us standards, as stated (in Numb. 2:2): <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small>. The Holy One cherished Israel with great love,<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> in that he appointed them standards like &#x003C;those of&#x003E; the ministering angels, so that they would be recognizable, the children of Reuben by themselves, the children of Simeon by themselves, &#x003C;etc&#x003E;; but where is it shown that he loved them? Where it is stated (in Cant. 2:4): [<small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE BANQUET HOUSE</small>,] <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a rich person who had a storehouse full of wine. He went in to inspect it and found it to be vinegar. &#x003C;When&#x003E; he went to leave the storehouse, he found there one cask of [good] wine. He said this cask is worth as much to me as the full storehouse. Similarly the Holy One has created seventy nations, but of them all he has found pleasure only in Israel, as stated (in Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE BANQUET HOUSE</small> (literally: <small>HOUSE OF WINE</small> [<italic><small>YYN</small></italic>]). &#x003C;Now&#x003E; <italic><small>Y</small></italic> (<italic>yod</italic>) plus <italic><small>Y</small></italic> (<italic>yod</italic>), &#x003C;which&#x003E; equals twenty, plus <italic>N</italic> (<italic>nun</italic>), &#x003C;which stands for&#x003E; fifty, results in seventy; and of all those &#x003C;seventy nations&#x003E; he loved only Israel. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. It also says (in Cant. 6:8-9): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS&#x2026;. ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE</small>.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE HOUSE OF WINE</small>.] R.

<p>[R. Issachar said: What is the meaning (of Cant. 2:4): <small>AND HIS STANDARD</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>) <small>OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. Even though, when sitting and studing the Torah, one skips (rt.: <italic><small>DLG</small></italic>) from precept (<italic>halakhah</italic>) to precept and from verse to verse, the Holy One says: He is dear to me (literally: over me), <small>AND HIS STANDARD</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>) <small>OVER ME IS LOVE</small>, and his skipping (rt.: <italic><small>DLG</small></italic>) over me is love.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 2:4): <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. The Holy One said: The nations of the world have standards, but only the standard of Jacob is dear to me, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>.].</p>

<p>(Numb. 2:2:) <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS &#x003C;FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSES&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> This text is related (to Cant. 6:10): <small>WHO IS THIS WOMAN THAT SHINES THROUGH</small> [<small>LIKE THE DAWN, AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE MOON, CLEAR AS THE SUN</small>&#x2026;?] Holy and grand was Israel by her standards&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> So all the nations were looking at them, as they said in astonishment (ibid): <small>WHO IS THIS WOMAN THAT SHINES THROUGH</small>?

And what grandeur are you giving to us? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; perhaps (ibid., cont.) <small>LIKE A DANCE OF THE CAMPS</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> Can you possibly give us anything like the grandeur which the <small>LORD</small> our God gave us in the desert? &#x003C;There he gave us&#x003E; the standard of the camp of Judah, the standard of the camp of Reuben, the standard of the camp of Ephraim, the standard of the camp of Dan. Are you able to do so for us? (Cant. 7:1 [6:13]): <small>WHAT WILL YOU SEE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HZH</small></italic>) <small>IN THE SHULAMMITE</small>? It is perhaps (ibid., cont.) <small>LIKE A DANCE</small> (<italic>meholat</italic>) <small>OF THE CAMPS</small>, in that when we sin, he pardons (<italic>mohel</italic>) us and says to us (in Deut. 23:15 [14]): <small>AND YOUR CAMP SHALL BE HOLY</small>? So also Balaam the Wicked beheld them and his eyes popped out as he faced them, because he could not touch them, as stated (in Numb. 24:2): <small>THEN BALAAM RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ISRAEL DWELLING TRIBE BY TRIBE</small>.

<title>1.12 Numbers 2:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>[(Numb. 2:2:) <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE</small>. This text is related] (to Job 36:3): <small>I WILL FETCH MY KNOWLEDGE FROM AFAR, AND JUSTIFY MY MAKER</small>. It was only necessary to say: &#x201C;Each under his standard&#x201D;; [under the banners shall the children of Israel camp.]<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> Then what is the significance of saying (in Numb. 2:2:) <small>WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small> [<small>FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE</small>]. Simply that when our father Jacob departed from this world, he said to them (in Gen. 47:30): <small>WHEN I SLEEP WITH MY ANCESTORS, YOU ARE TO TAKE ME UP FROM EGYPT AND BURY ME IN THEIR GRAVE</small>. He went around to all his sons, blessed them, and gave them a charge. He said to them: When you take me, you are to take me with reverence and honor. Let no other person, neither one of the Egyptians nor one of your children, touch my bier, because there are some among them who have taken &#x003C;wives&#x003E; from the daughters of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> And so it says (in Gen. 50:12-13): <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM JUST AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>, [<small>IN THAT HIS CHILDREN BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>]. His children, but not his grandchildren (who were forbidden to touch the bier)&#x0021; &#x007B;(Gen. 50:13): <small>IN THAT HIS CHILDREN BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>.&#x007D; How did he charge them? He said to them: Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun shall carry my bier on the east; Reuben, Simeon, and Gad, on the south; Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, on the west; Dan, Asher, and Naphtali, on the north. Joseph is not to carry &#x003C;at all&#x003E;, because he is a king; but you must impart honor to him. Nor is Levi to carry. Why? Because he carries the ark (<italic>aron</italic>), and whoever carries the ark of the One who Lives Forever is not to carry a coffin (<italic>aron</italic>) of the dead. If you do this and carry my bier, just as I have charged you, the Holy One is going to have you encamp by the various standards. When he passed away, they carried him just as he had charged them. It is so stated (in Numb. 5:12): <small>SO HIS CHILDREN DID FOR HIM JUST AS HE HAD COMMANDED THEM</small>. What is written next (in vs. 13)? <small>HIS CHILDREN BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>, when Israel went forth from Egypt. The Holy One said: Now is the time for them to make standards, just as their father had proclaimed to them that they were going to make standards. Immediately the Holy One said to Moses: Make those standards for my name. Immediately Moses began to be concerned. He said: There is going to be dissension among the tribes. If I tell the tribe of Judah to encamp in the east, they will say: It is impossible for us to encamp anywhere but in the south. And so each and every tribe &#x003C;would act&#x003E; like that one. The Holy One said to him: [What concern is that to you?] They do not need you in this matter. They will recognize their dwellings by themselves. Why? Because their father&#x2019;s will was in their hand on how to encamp by the standards. I am not establishing something new. They already have their father&#x2019;s arrangements<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup> in their hands. Just as they have taken positions around his bier, so let them take positions around the Tabernacle. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Numb. 2:2): <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small> [<small>FOR THEIR FATHERS&#x2019; HOUSE</small>].</p>
<title>1.13 Numbers 2:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>How were they encamped? The Levites camped around the Tabernacle of Witness, with Moses, Aaron, and his children on the east.<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 3:38): <small>THOSE WHO CAMPED BEFORE THE TABERNACLE, IN FRONT BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING TO THE EAST, WERE MOSES, AARON, AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. And adjacent to them were Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. Hence they said: Blessed is the righteous person and blessed are his neighbors.<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> This refers to the three tribes (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>BT</small></italic>) which were adjacent to Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> They became great in the Torah, as stated (in Gen. 49:10): <small>THE SCEPTER</small> (<italic><small>S</small>h<small>BT</small></italic>) <small>SHALL NOT DEPART FROM JUDAH</small> [&#x2026;. In the case of Issachar it is written] (in I Chron. 12:33 [32]): <small>AND FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISSACHAR, THOSE WHO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> <small>TO KNOW WHAT ISRAEL SHOULD DO; THEIR HEADS NUMBERED TWO HUNDRED</small>. These were two hundred heads of &#x003C;tribal&#x003E; sanhedria<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup> that would come out of Issachar. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ALL THEIR KINDRED UNDER THEIR COMMAND</small> (<italic>&#x2018;al pihem</italic>), &#x003C;i.e., because they harmonize law (<italic>halakhah</italic>) at their command (<italic>&#x2018;al pihem</italic>). Of Zebulun it is written] (in Jud. 5:14): <small>AND FROM ZEBULUN THOSE WHO WIELD THE SCRIBAL PEN</small>. Because they were neighbors of Torah, they all became children of Torah (i.e., Torah scholars). Now on the south were the children of Kohath (ben Levi), and adjacent to them were Reuben, Simeon, and Gad. Hence they say: Woe to the wicked person; and woe to his neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> These are the three tribes which were neighbors of Korah (the grandson of Kohath) and his community in the South. These were destroyed with him in his dissension (as stated in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, &#x003C;EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;. On the west were the children of Gershom (i.e., Gershon ben Levi), with Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin being adjacent to them; and on the North also were the children of Merari (ben Levi), with Dan, Naphtali, and Asher being adjacent to them. [Seven] clouds of glory were surrounding them, and this was their &#x003C;method&#x003E; of travel. There was a sign<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> for Moses in the cloud when it departed. When it departed, he would say (in Numb. 10:35): <small>RISE UP, O LORD, AND MAY YOUR ENEMIES BE SCATTERED</small>. Then the cloud would depart. When the cloud departed, they all prepared to travel and put away their implements. Whoever had a domestic beast &#x003C;put them on it&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup>; and if &#x003C;a person&#x003E; had none, the cloud took the remainder. When they were settled, they blew the trumpets. Then Judah and its standard moved out, first its prince and his tribe after him.<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> And as signs for each and every prince there was a flag.<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> [And from them the empire learned to make a flag.] &#x003C;There was&#x003E; also a color for each and every flag, like the color of the precious stones which were on the heart of Aaron. Each and every tribe had its flag dyed like the color of its stone. Then over them were the clouds. &#x007B;Until they were settled, they blew the trumpets. They traveled, and likewise &#x003C;the clouds&#x003E; traveled over them.&#x007D; Moreover, something like a kind of beam came out of the cloud, so that they would know in which direction they would be traveling. So was the journey of each and every standard. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they finished going to where it wanted them to camp, &#x003C;since&#x003E; that cloud which appeared like a kind of beam had, as it were, been traveling independently, they knew that they would camp in that place. &#x003C;When&#x003E; clouds of glory stood still for them, they began putting &#x003C;things&#x003E; away in their tents where they were to rest. Then the cloud which was over the Tabernacle, moved over the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps. First it stood still. When it stood still, the children of Kohath and the children of Levi set up the Tabernacle in the presence of all the camps before they came, as stated (in Numb. 10:21): <small>AND THEY WOULD SET UP THE TABERNACLE BEFORE THEY CAME</small>. When they had set up the Tabernacle, each and every one set up &#x003C;camp&#x003E; in his &#x003C;proper&#x003E; place. Then the clouds of glory stood over them. This was grandeur in the hands of Moses, for the cloud of the glorious Divine Presence did not come down to the Tabernacle, until Moses had said (in Numb. 10:36): <small>RETURN, O LORD, TO THE MYRIAD THOUSANDS OF ISRAEL</small>. Then the clouds of glory encompassed them. Moreover, the Holy Spirit says through Solomon (in Cant. 6:4): <small>YOU ARE AS BEAUTIFUL, MY DARLING, AS TIRZAH</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AS TIRZAH</small> (<italic><small>KTRT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>, rt.: <italic><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>)? That I am pleasing (<italic><small>MTRT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>, rt.: <italic><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>) to you.<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Cant. 6:4). <small>AS TIRZAH</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>) &#x003C;means&#x003E; just as you are pleasing (rt.: <italic><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>) to me in the sacrifices. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 1:4): <small>AND IT SHALL BE PLEASING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RT</small>s<small>H</small></italic>) <small>FOR HIM TO ATONE FOR HIM</small>. (Cant. 6:4, cont.:) <small>AS COMELY AS JERUSALEM</small> (<italic><small>YRUS</small>h<small>LYM</small></italic>) &#x003C;means&#x003E; like these ministering Angels, in that they feared (rt.: <italic><small>YR</small></italic>&#x2019;) &#x003C;me&#x003E; and were reconciled (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></italic>) to me. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AWESOME AS &#x003C;HOSTS&#x003E; WITH STANDARDS</small>, like the standards which I gave you. So when David sees &#x003C;them&#x003E;, he says (in Ps. 147:20): <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION</small>, only for his people.</p>
<title>1.14 Numbers 2:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 2:2:) <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small>. This text is related (to Deut. 32:10): <small>HE FOUND HIM</small> (i.e., Jacob) <small>IN A DESERT LAND</small>. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; a great find, &#x003C;when&#x003E; the Holy One found Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> &#x003C;He was&#x003E; like a person who, when traveling in the desert, finds grapes there. So did the Holy One find Israel, as stated (in Hos. 9:10): [<small>I FOUND ISRAEL</small>] <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 32:10): <small>HE FOUND HIM IN A DESERT LAND</small>. The world was a desert, before Israel came forth from Egypt. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND IN THE VOID WAS A WAILING DESOLATION</small>. The world was void and wailing, before Israel received the Torah. &#x007B;He did nothing, but when] [When] Israel came forth from Egypt and received the Torah, &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; enlightened the world, as stated (in Prov. 6:23): <small>FOR THE COMMANDMENT IS A LAMP, AND TORAH IS A LIGHT</small>. [(Deut. 32:10, cont.:) <small>HE ENCIRCLED HIM, HE WATCHED OVER HIM, AND HE PROTECTED HIM AS THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>HE ENCIRCLED HIM</small>? That he encompassed them with clouds of glory. <small>HE WATCHED OVER</small> (rt.: <italic><small>BYN</small></italic>) <small>HIM</small> in that he taught (rt.: <italic><small>BYN</small></italic>) them the words of Torah. <small>HE PROTECTED HIM</small>. Blessed are the ears that have heard. To what extent did he cherish them? To what extent did he keep them? To what extent did he protect them? As much, as it were, as the pupil of his eye. See how he cherished them, kept them, and protected them. It is as the Holy One said to Moses: Tell them to make a tabernacle, and I will dwell among them. [I am, as it were, leaving the heavenly beings and coming down to dwell among them.] And not only that, but I will make them standards for my name. Why? Because they are my children, as stated (in Deut. 14:1): <small>YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. Also they are my hosts, as stated (in Exod. 7:4): <small>AND I WILL BRING FORTH MY HOSTS</small>, [<small>MY PEOPLE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. And so it says (in Numb. 2:3): &#x007B;<small>YOU SHALL RECKON</small>&#x007D; <small>THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF JUDAH BY THEIR HOSTS</small>. Therefore, he made those standards for my name, as stated (in Numb. 2:2): <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD</small>,&#x2026;.</p>
<title>1.15 Numbers 2:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>[(Numb. 2:2:) <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small>.] This text is related (to Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE BANQUET HOUSE</small>, [<small>AND HIS STANDARD</small> (<italic><small>DGL</small></italic>) <small>OVER ME IS LOVE</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE BANQUET HOUSE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> When the Holy One was revealed upon Mount Sinai, there descended with him twenty-two thousand chariots of angels, as stated (in Ps. 68:18): <small>THE CHARIOTS OF GOD ARE TWO MYRIADS, THOUSANDS FOR A DOUBLING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> Now they all were arranged by standards (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>). It is therefore stated (in Cant. 5:10): <small>&#x003C;MY BELOVED IS BRIGHT AND RUDDY,&#x003E; THE MOST PROMINENT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>) <small>OF TEN THOUSAND</small>. When Israel saw them, as they were arrayed by standards (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>), they yearned for standards. They said: O that we might be arrayed with standards like them&#x0021; It is therefore stated (in Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE BANQUET HOUSE</small>, [<small>AND HIS STANDARD</small> (<italic><small>DGL</small></italic>) <small>OVER ME IS LOVE</small>]. <small>THE BANQUET HOUSE</small> (literally: <small>HOUSE OF WINE</small>) is Mount Sinai, on which Torah was given, [since &#x003C;Torah&#x003E; is compared to wine], as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where wisdom is saying): <small>AND DRINK OF THE WINE I HAVE MIXED</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 2:4): <small>HE BROUGHT ME UNTO THE HOUSE OF WINE</small>, namely to Sinai. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND HIS STANDARD OVER ME IS LOVE</small>. They said: O that he may raise the standard of love over me&#x0021; And so it says (in Ps. 20:6 [5]): <small>LET US SHOUT FOR JOY IN YOUR SALVATION, AND IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LET US SET UP OUR STANDARDS</small>. The Holy One said to them: Do you yearn for standards? By your life, I will fulfill your petition. It is so stated (ibid., cont.): <small>MAY THE LORD FULFILL ALL YOUR PETITIONS</small>. Immediately the Holy One made known his love to Israel and said to Moses: Go and make those standards like the ones for which they have yearned.</p>
<title>1.16 Numbers 2:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 2:2:) <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD, UNDER THE BANNERS</small> [&#x2026;.<small>&#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL CAMP,&#x003E; SHALL CAMP AROUND THE TENT OF MEETING AT A DISTANCE</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>AT A DISTANCE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: At a distance of a mile.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Israel shall be at a distance of two thousand cubits from the ark, as stated (in Josh. 3:4): <small>YET THERE SHALL BE A DISTANCE BETWEEN YOU AND IT OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CUBITS</small>. But Moses and Aaron shall be near to it, as stated (in Numb. 3:38): <small>THOSE WHO CAMPED BEFORE THE TABERNACLE</small>, [<small>IN FRONT BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING TO THE EAST, WERE MOSES, AARON, AND HIS CHILDREN&#x2026;</small>.] Why were Moses and Aaron near it? It is simply that the Holy One had said: If I become angry with my children, they will mediate between me and my children. For that reason they are near it, but the tribes (according to Numb. 2:2) <small>SHALL CAMP AROUND THE TENT OF MEETING AT A DISTANCE</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 2:3): <small>NOW THOSE WHO CAMP IN FRONT TO THE EAST</small>. You find that in every place Judah is first.<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> &#x003C;It is first&#x003E; in the case standards, as stated (in Numb. 2:3): <small>NOW THOSE WHO CAMP IN FRONT TO THE EAST SHALL BE &#x003C;THOSE UNDER&#x003E; THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF JUDAH</small>. So much for camping. Where is it shown for traveling? Where it is stated (in Numb. 10:14): <small>AND &#x003C;IN FIRST PLACE TRAVELED&#x003E; THE CAMP STANDARD OF</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>JUDAH</small>. Where is it shown for sacrifices? Where it is stated (in Numb. 7:12): <small>AND THE ONE WHO OFFERED</small> [&#x2026;] [<small>ON THE FIRST DAY WAS NAHSHON BEN AMMINADAB OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH</small>]. Where is it shown for warfare? [Where it is stated] (in Jud. 1:1-2): <small>WHO SHALL BE THE FIRST TO GO UP FOR US AGAINST THE CANAANITES TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM? THEN THE LORD SAID: LET JUDAH GO UP</small>. And also, when the herald &#x003C;of messianic age&#x003E; comes, Judah shall receive the good news first, as stated (in Nahum 2:1): <small>BEHOLD OVER THE MOUNTAINS THE FEET OF THE HERALD</small> [<small>ANNOUNCING PEACE</small>]&#x0021; <small>CELEBRATE YOUR FESTIVALS, O JUDAH, FULFILL YOUR VOWS</small>. The Holy One said to them: In this world I have arrayed you by standards, as stated (in Numb. 2:2): <small>EACH WITH HIS STANDARD</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>); but in the world to come, by virtue of the banners, I shall &#x007B;exalt (rt.: <italic><small>DLG</small></italic>)&#x007D; [leap up (rt.: <italic><small>DGL</small></italic>)] and redeem you, as stated (in Cant. 2:8): <small>THE VOICE OF MY BELOVED</small>&#x0021; <small>HERE HE COMES, LEAPING OVER THE MOUNTAINS&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.17 Numbers 3:15ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 3:15:) <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM, &#x003C;LIKE A CEDAR OF LEBANON SHALL HE GROW&#x003E;</small>. Just as the palm &#x003C;casts&#x003E; its shadow &#x003C;only&#x003E; at a distance<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup>; so the reward of the righteous is at a distance &#x003C;from them&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> Just as the palm produces &#x003C;ripe&#x003E; dates and produces unripenable dates; so it is with Israel. It has Torah scholars within it, and it has ignoramuses (<italic>&#x2018;amme ha&#x2019;arets</italic>) within it. Just as the palm has within it unripenable dates, which never enter the storehouse, yet produces ripe dates, and these do enter the store house; so it was with Israel in the wilderness. Some of them did enter the land of Israel; yet some of them did not enter.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM, &#x003C;LIKE A CEDAR OF LEBANON&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; As with the palm, if it is cut down or uprooted, another does not grow up in its stead; so also with the cedar, when it is uprooted or cut down, it does not grow again.<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> The righteous are therefore to be compared with the palm and with the cedar.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM</small>. Just as the palm produces dates and produces thorns, &#x003C;so that&#x003E; whenever anyone seeks to steal the dates, the thorns prevail against him; so it is with the righteous. Whoever does not preserve his soul from them is stricken. Why? (<italic>Avot</italic> 2:10:) <small>BECAUSE THEIR BITE IS THE BITE OF A FOX, THEIR STING IS THE STING OF A SCORPION, THEIR HISS IS THE HISS OF A SERPENT, AND ALL THEIR WORDS ALSO ARE LIKE COALS OF FIRE</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Ps. 92:13 [12]): <small>THE RIGHTEOUS ONE SHALL FLOURISH LIKE THE PALM</small>. &#x003C;The passage&#x003E; speaks about the tribe of Levi, in that the Holy One set them apart because of their good works. What is written next (in vs. 14 [13])? <small>PLANTED IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD; THEY SHALL PROSPER IN THE COURTS OF OUR GOD</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach you that they never moved from the Temple, as stated (in Ps. 101:6): <small>MY EYES ARE ON THE FAITHFUL IN THE LAND</small> [<small>THAT THEY MAY DWELL WITH ME. THE ONE WHO WALKS IN THE WAY OF THE BLAMELESS SHALL MINISTER TO ME</small>]. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 92:14 [13]): <small>PLANTED IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD</small>, where no help was lacking for them, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>THEY SHALL PROSPER IN THE COURTS OF OUR GOD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>IN THE COURTS</small>? This text is related (to Ps. 65:5 [4]): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE YOU CHOOSE AND BRING NEAR TO DWELL IN YOUR COURTS. MAY WE BE SATED WITH THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HOUSE, YOUR HOLY TEMPLE</small>. The Holy One said: In as much as they are my legions,<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> go and number them. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.18 Numbers 3:15ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 3:15:) <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 68:7 [6]): <small>GOD CAUSES INDIVIDUALS TO DWELL IN A HOME</small>. A certain matron<sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup> asked R. Jose ben Halafta: In how many days did the Holy One create the world? He said to her: In six days, as stated (in Exod. 31:17): <small>FOR IN SIX DAYS THE LORD MADE &#x003C;HEAVEN AND EARTH&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup> She said to him: Ever since the world was created, what does he do? He sits &#x003C;there&#x003E; arranging marriages and issuing decrees. So he says so-and-so shall marry so-and-so. It is so stated (in Ps. 68:7 [6]): <small>GOD CAUSES INDIVIDUALS TO DWELL IN A HOME</small>. Who was this &#x003C;so-and-so&#x003E;? This was Amram and his wife was Jochebed, since through their merit the Holy One brought Israel out of Egypt, where they had been enslaved to clay and bricks.<sup><xref rid="fn100">100</xref></sup> What did the Holy One do? He married Jochebed to Amram in order to raise up from them a redeemer for Israel and from them to raise up high priests. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>GOD CAUSES INDIVIDUALS TO DWELL IN A HOME</small>. The Holy One said: In as much as this tribe is accustomed to be raising up redeemers, go and number them. (Numb. 3:15:) <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.19 Numbers 3:15ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. But it is written in another place (i.e., in Numb. 1:49): <small>HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI, NOR SHALL YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn101">101</xref></sup> It is simply that the Holy One said: In as much as they have given their souls to me, go and number them separately. Now when had they given their souls to the Holy One? When Israel had committed that act (of the golden calf). It is so stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP</small> [<small>AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, &#x003C;COME&#x003E; TO ME. THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM</small>]. The Holy One said to Moses: In as much as they are standing in their blemishes,<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> go and number them. (In the words of Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum says: The Holy One is accustomed to numbering &#x003C;the children of&#x003E; this tribe in every case while they are young.<sup><xref rid="fn103">103</xref></sup> How is it shown? When the Holy One told Jacob to go down to Egypt, at that time he numbered Israel and his children; and all of them were found &#x003C;to number&#x003E; sixty-six, [as stated (in Gen. 46:26): <small>AND ALL THE SOULS&#x2026; WERE SIXTY-SIX</small>.] In addition were Joseph&#x2019;s two sons, plus Joseph, for a total of seventy minus one. But it says (in vs. 27): <small>ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH CAME TO EGYPT, WERE SEVENTY</small>. R. Levi said: R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One customarily numbers this tribe while they are in their mother&#x2019;s womb.<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah [the Priest Berabbi] said: There is not enough resin to flow out before they collect it.<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup> So it was in the case of Jochebed. Her mother was pregnant with her; and while she was in her mother&#x2019;s womb, she was numbered together with her. Resh Laqish said: While her mother was entering the gate of Egypt, her mother gave birth to her. The statement is therefore made concerning seventy souls (in Gen. 46:27). And also concerning her children&#x2019;s children, the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 3:15): [<small>YOU SHALL ENROLL</small>] <small>EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD</small>. Moses said to him: Am I able to persevere and go around into their courtyards and into the midst of their houses to number each and every one of them, when you say (ibid.): <small>EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn106">106</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Moses: You do your &#x003C;part&#x003E;, and I will do my &#x003C;part&#x003E;. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Moses would go and stand at the gate of the tent &#x003C;in question&#x003E;. Then the Divine Presence would draw near and say to him: There are five infants in this tent; there are ten infants in that tent. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Numb. 3:16): <small>SO MOSES ENROLLED THEM ACCORDING TO THE WORD</small> (literally: <small>ACCORDING TO THE MOUTH</small>) <small>OF THE LORD AS HE HAD BEEN COMMANDED</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; just as the Divine Presence told him.</p>
<title>1.20 Numbers 3:15ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 3:15:) <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. This tribe was particularly dear to the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> But why out of all the tribes was none chosen except this one, as stated (in I Sam. 2:28): <small>AND I CHOSE HIM</small> [<small>FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TO BE MY PRIEST&#x2026;</small>.] How so? The Holy One created days and chose one of them for himself, as stated (in Ps. 139:16): <small>DAYS WERE FORMED, AND ONE OF THEM WAS HIS OWN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup> And which is it? R. Levi says: This is the Sabbath. He created years and chose one of them for himself, i.e., the seventh, as stated (in Lev. 25:2): <small>THEN THE LAND SHALL OBSERVE A SABBATH FOR THE LORD</small>. He created weeks &#x003C;of years&#x003E; and chose one of them for himself, i.e., the Jubilee, as stated (in Lev. 25:10): <small>AND YOU SHALL SANCTIFY THE FIFTIETH YEAR</small>. He created countries, and chose one of them for himself, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; the land of Israel, as stated (in Deut. 11:12): <small>A LAND FOR WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD CARES</small>; [<small>THE EYES OF THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALWAYS UPON IT</small>. [And so the Holy One calls it his land, as stated (in Joel 4[3]:2): <small>THEY HAVE DIVIDED UP</small> &#x007B;<small>HIS</small>&#x007D; [<small>MY</small>] <small>LAND</small>.] He created firmaments and chose one of them for himself, i.e., Aravot,<sup><xref rid="fn109">109</xref></sup> as stated (in Ps. 68:5 [4]): <small>BUILD A WAY FOR THE ONE WHO RIDES IN THE</small> &#x2018;<small>ARAVOT; THE LORD IS HIS NAME</small>. He created peoples and chose one of them for himself, i.e., Israel, as stated (in Deut. 7:6): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU TO BE FOR HIMSELF A TREASURED PEOPLE</small>, a nation of flesh, and you are flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn110">110</xref></sup> Now (according to Deut. 7:6): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU&#x2026;</small>. Why did he choose you? Because he loved you, as stated (in vs. 8): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD LOVED YOU</small>. He created tribes and chose one of them for himself, i.e., the tribe of Levi, as stated (in I Sam. 2:28): <small>AND I CHOSE HIM</small> [<small>FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>.] He therefore especially cherishes you. So he says to Moses each time (as in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; [<small>EVERY MALE</small>.] Why did he say: <small>EVERY MALE</small>, and not mention the noun, female? Because the glory of God arises from the males. &#x003C;Ergo:&#x003E; <small>EVERY MALE</small>. David has stated (in Ps. 127:3): <small>BEHOLD, SONS ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD; THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, A REWARD</small>. [<small>SONS ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE LORD</small>,] i.e., the males. <small>THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, A REWARD</small>,] for if females come, they also are a reward. And why does he enroll them each and every time? Because they are his troops,<sup><xref rid="fn111">111</xref></sup> and the king has much joy in his troops. Moreover, you find that the whole tribe of Levi was diminished (in number). And why were they diminished? Because they had seen the Divine Presence. So also when Israel came up from the captivity, they did not find any of them, because they had been diminished, as stated (in Ezra 8:15): <small>SO I VIEWED THE PEOPLE AND THE PRIESTS, BUT I FOUND THERE NONE OF THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. The Holy One said: In this world they were destroyed, because they had seen the Divine Presence, since it is stated (in Exod. 33:20): <small>FOR NO HUMAN SHALL SEE ME AND LIVE</small>. In the world to come, however, when I restore my Divine Presence to Zion, I will be revealed in my glory over all Israel. Then they shall see me and live forever. Thus it is stated (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY SHALL SEE &#x003C;THE RETURN OF HE LORD TO ZION&#x003E;</small>. And not only that, but they shall point out my glory to each other with the finger while saying (in the words of Ps. 48:15): <small>FOR THIS GOD, OUR GOD</small>. It also says (In Is. 25:9): <small>AND IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM</small> [<small>AND HE DELIVERED US</small>]. <small>THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.</p>
<title>1.21 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 3:40:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: ENROLL EVERY</small> [<small>FIRST-BORN</small>] <small>MALE&#x2026;</small>. Let our master instruct us: When an infant is born at eight months, does one profane the Sabbath for it?<sup><xref rid="fn112">112</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: When an infant is born at eight months one does not profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, or move it from place to place; however, its mother does lean over it to suckle it.<sup><xref rid="fn113">113</xref></sup> And in the case of one moving it on the Sabbath, it is as though he were moving a stone. &#x003C;When there is&#x003E; doubt &#x003C;whether it is&#x003E; an eight-month infant or a seven-month infant, one does not profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, or move it from place to place. But if it is a sure thing that it is &#x003C;an infant of&#x003E; seven months, one does profane the Sabbath for it, cut its umbilical cord, bury its placenta, and move it from place to place. And why does one profane the Sabbath for one born, when it is born at seven &#x003C;months from conception&#x003E;? Because it is capable of life. However, in the case of one born at eight &#x003C;months&#x003E;, it has not &#x003C;completed&#x003E; its months and is not capable of life. For that reason one does not profane the Sabbath for it. They asked R. Abbahu: Where is it shown that one born at seven months will live?<sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup> He said to them: In the Greek<sup><xref rid="fn115">115</xref></sup> language <italic>zeta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn116">116</xref></sup> is <italic>hepta</italic> (the Greek number seven); <italic>eta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup> is <italic>okto</italic> (the Greek number eight). Now which is &#x003C;an infant&#x003E; of eight months? Anyone whose hair and nails are undeveloped. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: whoever does not live thirty days has not &#x003C;completed&#x003E; his months, but is a miscarriage.<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> And on what did the knowledge of Rabban [Simeon ben] Gamaliel depend? On the word of Torah, because the first-born were only redeemed after thirty days, [as stated] (in Numb. 18:16): <small>AND THEIR REDEMPTION MONEY &#x2014; FROM A MONTH OF AGE &#x003C;AND OLDER&#x003E; YOU SHALL REDEEM THEM</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses that the first-born should only be redeemed <small>FROM A MONTH OF AGE &#x003C;AND OLDER&#x003E;</small>. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Numb. 3:40): <small>AND THE &#x003C;LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: &#x003E; ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL A MONTH OF AGE AND OLDER&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.22 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED, AND I LOVE YOU</small>. The Holy One said to Jacob: Jacob, you are exceedingly precious in my eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn119">119</xref></sup> Why? Because I, as it were, have installed your image<sup><xref rid="fn120">120</xref></sup> on my glorious throne, and in your name the angels praise me and say (in Ps. 41:14 [13]): <small>BLESSED BE THE LORD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn121">121</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;FROM EVERLASTING TO EVERLASTINGS</small> Ergo (in Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS</small>. The Holy One said: Jacob, you are precious in my eyes because I and my angels were, as it were, standing over you when you set out for Paddan-Aram and when you came back. It is so stated (in Gen. 28:10-13): <small>AND JACOB SET OUT&#x2026;. WHEN HE CAME ACROSS A CERTAIN PLACE&#x2026;. &#x003C;THEN HE DREAMED THAT THERE WAS A LADDER PLACED ON EARTH WITH ITS TOP REACHING TO THE HEAVENS; AND BEHOLD, THE ANGELS OF GOD WERE ASCENDING AND DESCENDING ON IT.&#x003E; AND BEHOLD, THE LORD STOOD OVER HIM&#x2026;</small>. R. Hosha&#x2018;ya said: Blessed is the one born of woman who has seen the King and his household<sup><xref rid="fn122">122</xref></sup> standing over him and ministering to him. But where is it shown in reference to his coming back? Where it is stated (in Gen. 32:2 [1]): <small>SO JACOB WENT ON HIS WAY, AND THE ANGELS OF GOD MET HIM</small>. So much for the angels, but where is it shown for the Divine Presence? (Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN&#x2026;</small>. It is therefore stated (in Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Is. 43:4): <small>BECAUSE YOU ARE PRECIOUS IN MY EYES, YOU ARE HONORED</small>.] The Holy One said: You are precious in my eyes, because to all the those nations I gave no numbering (<italic>minyan</italic>), but to you I did give a numbering. It is comparable to a king of flesh and blood who had a lot of granaries, but all of them were dirty and full of darnel; so he was not meticulous about numbering. &#x003C;There was,&#x003E; however, this granary &#x003C;which had&#x003E; beautiful wheat. I therefore want to be meticulous in numbering how many kors<sup><xref rid="fn123">123</xref></sup> there are, how many sacks there are in it, &#x003C;and&#x003E; how many measures there are in it. Similarly this king is the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One; and this granary (<italic>goren</italic>) is Israel, since it is stated (in Is. 21:10): <small>MY THRESHING, AND THE PRODUCT</small> (literally: <small>THE CHILD</small>) <small>OF MY THRESHING FLOOR</small> (<italic>goren</italic>). It also says (in Jer. 2:3): <small>ISRAEL IS THE LORD&#x2019;S SANCTUARY</small>, [<small>THE BEGINNING OF HIS HARVEST</small>]. The child of his house is Moses, as stated (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT MOSES</small>; [<small>HE IS TRUSTED IN ALL MY HOUSE</small>]. The Holy One said to him: The nations are comparable to thorns, as stated (in Is. 33:12): <small>AND THE PEOPLES SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN &#x003C;THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE&#x003E;</small>. Therefore, you shall not be meticulous about numbering them, but Israel is righteous, as stated (in Is. 60:21): <small>AND ALL OF YOUR PEOPLE ARE RIGHTEOUS</small>. It also says (in Cant. 4:7): <small>YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ALL OVER, MY BELOVED</small>, [<small>AND THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>]. Therefore, be meticulous in counting Israel. Moses did so. He numbered them &#x003C;to determine&#x003E; how many kors there were, as stated (in Numb. 1:2): <small>TAKE A CENSUS&#x2026;</small>.; how many sacks there were, as stated (in Numb. 2:4): <small>HIS HOST AND THOSE OF THEM ENROLLED</small>; and how many measures there were, as stated (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.</p>
<title>1.23 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 6:8-9): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS, EIGHTY CONCUBINES, AND MAIDENS WITHOUT NUMBER; &#x003C;BUT ONLY&#x003E; ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a certain merchant,<sup><xref rid="fn124">124</xref></sup> who had glass beads,<sup><xref rid="fn125">125</xref></sup> which he would bring to market; but he paid no attention to their number (<italic>minyan</italic>), because he had brought them out without counting (<italic>minyan</italic>) &#x003C;them&#x003E;. So when he came in to put them away, he put them away without counting. Because they were &#x003C;made&#x003E; of glass, he did not pay attention to them. However, he had a certain string<sup><xref rid="fn126">126</xref></sup> of fine pearls;<sup><xref rid="fn127">127</xref></sup> and this he would take and bring out with a count, then put away with a count. Similarly, as it were, the Holy One said &#x003C;in regard&#x003E; to the nations of the world: I have not given them a count, because none of them is important to me, as stated (in Is. 40:17): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM; THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY HIM AS LESS THAN NOTHING AND VOID</small>. But as for you, you are my children, as stated (in Is. 46:3): <small>THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN BORNE BY ME FROM BIRTH, CARRIED FROM THE WOMB</small>. I therefore count you on every occasion. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. Ergo (in Cant. 6:8-9): <small>THERE ARE SIXTY QUEENS</small> [&#x2026;, <small>AND MAIDENS WITHOUT NUMBER</small>]; <small>&#x003C;BUT ONLY&#x003E; ONE IS MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE&#x2026;</small>. This is Israel.</p>
<title>1.24 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. The Holy One said: Because of the love for Israel I have altered the &#x003C;natural&#x003E; order of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn128">128</xref></sup> How? I had written in my Torah that an ass should be redeemed with a lamb, as stated (in Exod. 34:20): <small>BUT THE FIRSTLING OF AN ASS YOU SHALL REDEEM WITH A LAMB</small> (<italic>seh</italic>). But I did not do so. Instead I redeemed a lamb (<italic>seh</italic>) with an ass. The Egyptians are likened to an ass, where it is stated (in Ezek. 23:20): <small>WHOSE FLESH IS LIKE THE FLESH OF ASSES</small>; and Israel is called a lamb (<italic>seh</italic>), where it is stated (in Jer. 50:17): <small>ISRAEL IS A SCATTERED FLOCK</small> (<italic>seh</italic>). Then I slew the first-born of the Egyptians and sanctified the first-of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 8:17): <small>FOR EVERY FIRST-BORN AMONG</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>] <small>BELONGS TO ME</small>, [<small>HUMAN AND BEAST; ON THE DAY THAT I SMOTE ALL THE FIRST-BORN IN THE LAND OF EGYPT I SANCTIFIED THEM FOR MYSELF</small>. He therefore said to him (in Numb. 3:40): <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.]</p>
<title>1.25 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part V</title>
<p>[(Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.] But look, I brought out two hundred and seventy-three first-born, who were found to be in excess of the &#x003C;number of&#x003E; the Levites at the time that Moses numbered them.<sup><xref rid="fn129">129</xref></sup> R. Judah and R. Nehemiah differ.<sup><xref rid="fn130">130</xref></sup> R. Judah says: This is what Moses did: He took &#x007B;two hundred and seventy-three&#x007D; [twenty-two thousand] lots<sup><xref rid="fn131">131</xref></sup> and wrote &#x201C;Levi,&#x201D; on each of them. Then he took two hundred and seventy-three more lots and wrote &#x201C;five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn132">132</xref></sup> &#x003C;on each of them&#x003E;. He mixed them up and put them in an urn.<sup><xref rid="fn133">133</xref></sup> Then the father of a first-born would put his hand into the urn. If there came up in his hand a lot on which was written &#x201C;Levite,&#x201D; he was redeemed (by a Levite) and exempted from the five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>; but if there came up in his hand a lot on which was written &#x201C;five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>,&#x201D; he handed over five <italic>sela&#x2018;im.</italic> These are the words of R. Judah. R. Nehemiah says: There is still a difference of opinion on the matter, because one could say to him: There is no lot here on which &#x201C;Levite&#x201D; is written.<sup><xref rid="fn134">134</xref></sup> That is the reason it did not come up in my hand. Instead this is what Moses did: He took lots according to the number of all the first-born, and wrote &#x201C;Levite&#x201D; on them. Then again he took other chits according to their number and wrote &#x201C;five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic> on them. He mixed them up and put them in an urn. Then the father of a first-born would reach into the urn. If a lot with &#x201C;Levite&#x201D; came up in his hand, he knew that a Levite had redeemed him, and had exempted him from the five <italic>sela&#x2018;im;</italic> but if a lot with &#x201C;five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>&#x201D; came up in his hand, [he handed over five <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>]. Then the officer said to him: Was there not another lot there on which &#x201C;Levite&#x201D; was written? So you are not worthy of being redeemed by a Levite.</p>
<title>1.26 Numbers 3:40 ff, Part VI</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 3:40:) <small>ENROLL</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) <small>EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>. There is &#x003C;a use of&#x003E; the root <italic><small>PQD</small></italic> for the first born, as stated (ibid.): <small>ENROLL</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) <small>EVERY FIRST-BORN MALE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn135">135</xref></sup> There is &#x003C;a use of&#x003E; the root <italic><small>PQD</small></italic> for children (in I Sam. 2:21): <small>FOR THE LORD VISITED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) <small>HANNAH; SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE THREE SONS &#x003C;AND TWO DAUGHTERS&#x003E;</small>. There is &#x003C;a use of&#x003E; the root <italic><small>PQD</small></italic> for watching over (in Job 10:12): <small>AND YOUR PROVIDENCE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) <small>HAS WATCHED OVER MY SPIRIT</small>. There is &#x003C;a use of&#x003E; the root <italic><small>PQD</small></italic> for peace (in Is. 60:17): <small>AND I WILL APPOINT PEACE AS YOUR OVERSEER</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PQD</small></italic>).</p>
<title>1.27 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 4:17-48:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING: DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &#x003C;FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. R. Tanhuma bar Abba said:<sup><xref rid="fn136">136</xref></sup> R. Levi said: <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. This refers to the lupine<sup><xref rid="fn137">137</xref></sup> which arrives with the dessert. One should not say: There are nuts and dates before me. I will say &#x003C;the blessing&#x003E; over them and leave the lupine alone. The Holy One said (ibid.): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>. R. Hezekiah and R. Jeremiah bar Abba said in the name of R. Johanan: It is with reference to everyone who does not say something in the name of the one who said it that the text says (ibid.): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE HE IS IMPOVERISHED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn138">138</xref></sup> So when a person hears something, it is necessary to cite it in the name of the one who &#x003C;originally&#x003E; said it, even though &#x003C;doing so takes up&#x003E; more than a third of a law (<italic>halakhah</italic>). Thus our masters have taught (in <italic>Pe&#x2019;ah</italic> 2:6): R. <small>NAHUM THE SCRIBE</small><sup><xref rid="fn139">139</xref></sup> <small>SAID: I HAVE RECEIVED FROM R. MAY&#x2019;ASHA, WHO RECEIVED</small> [<small>FROM ABBA, WHO RECEIVED FROM THE PAIRS</small> (<italic>zugot</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn140">140</xref></sup> <small>WHO RECEIVED</small>] <small>FROM THE ELDERS, A LAW</small> (<italic>halakhah</italic>) <small>OF MOSES FROM SINAI</small>. So it is with reference to whoever does not say something in the name of the one who said it that the text (of Prov. 22:22) says: <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED</small>. But everyone who does say something in the name of the one who said it brings redemption into the world.<sup><xref rid="fn141">141</xref></sup> From whom have you learned it? From Esther. When she heard of the matter from Mordecai, she said to Ahasuerus according to what is stated (in Esth. 2:22): <small>AND ESTHER SPOKE TO THE KING IN THE NAME OF MORDECAI</small>. For that reason she was worthy of having Israel be redeemed at her hands. Ergo: If you hear something, cite it in the name of the one who said it.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 22:22): <small>DO NOT ROB THE IMPOVERISHED</small>. It speaks about the tribe of Levi, and it is calling the tribe of Levi poor.<sup><xref rid="fn142">142</xref></sup> Were &#x003C;the Levites&#x003E; poor? R. Judah bar Simon and our masters differ. One of them says: Why were they called poor? Because they were poor from &#x003C;lack of&#x003E; inheritance, as stated (in Josh. 13:33): <small>BUT MOSES GAVE NO INHERITANCE TO THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. Therefore, do not rob them of the donations, which I have told you &#x003C;to give&#x003E;. But the other (i.e., our masters) said that they were poor in number. Why so? Because the ark was destroying them. Therefore the Holy One commanded Moses and said (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &#x003C;FROM THE LEVITES</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>1.28 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>.] Let our master instruct us: In the case of one who commits a transgression punishable with excision according to the Torah, how do they receive pardon &#x003C;and&#x003E; become freed from their excision?<sup><xref rid="fn143">143</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in Mak. 3:15): <small>ALL WHO ARE LIABLE TO EXCISION, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SCOURGED, ARE EXEMPT FROM THEIR EXCISION, AS STATED</small> (in Deut. 25:2-3): <small>THEN THE JUDGE SHALL HAVE HIM LIE DOWN&#x2026;. HE MAY GIVE HIM FORTY LASHES BUT NO MORE&#x2026;; THEN YOUR BROTHER WOULD BE DEGRADED. WHEN HE HAS BEEN SCOURGED, THEN HE IS &#x003C;AGAIN&#x003E; YOUR BROTHER</small>. And why forty lashes? It is simply that, because this <italic>adam</italic> was forty days in creation<sup><xref rid="fn144">144</xref></sup> and transgressed against the Torah, which was forty days in the giving, he will be given forty lashes and be exempt from his punishment (i.e., from excision). And so you find in the case of the first Adam. When he was commanded and told (in Gen. 2:17): <small>BUT FROM THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE</small> [<small>OF GOOD AND EVIL YOU SHALL NOT EAT</small> &#x2026;], he incurred the sentence of death; and the world was scourged with forty punishments: ten for Adam, ten for Eve, ten for the serpent, ten for the land. Therefore, when a person commits one of the transgressions &#x003C;punishable by death&#x003E;, he is scourged with forty lashes. And so you find with each and every thing that the Holy One commanded Moses, &#x003C; there were&#x003E; warnings and punishments. It is written concerning the Sabbath (Exod. 20:8): <small>REMEMBER THE SABBATH DAY</small>, as a warning; and as a punishment (there is Exod. 31:14): <small>WHOEVER PROFANES IT SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. They came to the desert and (according to Numb. 15:32) found one gathering &#x003C;wood on the Sabbath&#x003E;, but Moses did not know by what death he should be killed. However, &#x007B;(according to Lev. 24:12) <small>THEY LEFT HIM IN CUSTODY &#x003C;WHILE WAITING&#x003E; FOR A CLARIFICATION TO THEM FROM THE MOUTH OF THE LORD</small>.&#x007D; [(according to Numb. 15:34) <small>AND THEY LEFT HIM IN CUSTODY &#x003C;BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT SHOULD BE DONE TO HIM.&#x003E;</small>] The Holy One said (in vs. 35): <small>THE PERSON SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH; &#x003C;ALL THE CONGREGATION&#x003E; SHALL STONE HIM WITH STONES &#x003C;OUTSIDE OF THE CAMP&#x003E;</small>. Immediately Moses rose in prayer and said: Sovereign of the World, if someone from Israel should so sin, should he &#x003C;really&#x003E; be stoned? Behold, &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; would be destroyed. Make &#x003C;another&#x003E; arrangement for them. He said to him: Let them be scourged with forty lashes, and they will be exempt from excision. Similarly when the children of Aaron died, the tribe of Kohath saw them. They began yelling at Moses, saying: Are we to die like that? The Holy One said to Moses: Just as I have made an &#x003C;alternate&#x003E; arrangement for Aaron, as stated (in 16:3): <small>&#x003C;ONLY&#x003E; IN THIS WAY SHALL AARON COME &#x003C;INTO THE SANCTUARY&#x003E;: &#x2026;;</small> so also for the Kohathite families I am making a similar arrangement, lest they die when they come unto the Holy of Holies. (Numb. 4:19): <small>DO THIS FOR THEM</small> (i.e., for the Kohathites) <small>THAT THEY MAY LIVE AND NOT DIE&#x2026;.</small> Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &#x003C;FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>1.29 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 33:18-19): <small>BEHOLD, THE EYE OF THE LORD IS ON THOSE WHO FEAR HIM</small>, [&#x003C;<small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE&#x003E; TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH</small>]. The text speaks along many lines of thought.<sup><xref rid="fn145">145</xref></sup> For what we need, however, it is speaking about the tribe of Levi.<sup><xref rid="fn146">146</xref></sup> And where is it shown? Where the tribe of Levi is called Those who Fear the Lord, as stated (in Mal. 2:5): <small>AND I GAVE THEM</small> (i.e., life and peace) <small>TO HIM</small> (i.e. Levi) <small>AS WELL AS FEAR, AND HE FEARED ME</small>. (Ps. 33:18:) <small>ON THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE</small>, because they are always waiting for the name of the Holy One.(Ps. 33:19:) <small>TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH AND TO KEEP THEM ALIVE IN FAMINE</small>, through the twenty-four gifts which the Holy One has given them:<sup><xref rid="fn147">147</xref></sup> Ten in the sanctuary, ten within the borders, and four in Jerusalem.

<title>1.30 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES &#x003C;FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One foresaw that Korah was going to arise and be opposed to the priesthood.<sup><xref rid="fn148">148</xref></sup> The Holy One said: We will not destroy the Levites because of Korah. (Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &#x003C;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 48:9): <small>FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME I WILL DELAY MY ANGER, AND FOR MY PRAISE I WILL HOLD BACK FOR YOU SO AS NOT TO CUT YOU OFF</small>. To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn149">149</xref></sup> To a king who had a son that was associated with bandits;<sup><xref rid="fn150">150</xref></sup> and when they were captured, his son was captured with them. The king said: What shall I do? Shall I execute the robbers? Possibly my son is with them. Instead, for the sake of my son, I will free them for now. Similarly, the Levites carried the Tabernacle. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:9): [<small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>KOHATH HE GAVE NO &#x003C;WAGONS&#x003E;</small>, [<small>BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THE SHOULDER</small>], When the Holy One saw that Korah and his assembly were going to be opposed to Moses and Aaron, the Holy One said: What shall I do with these? To kill them is not possible. Why? Because the Holy One had taken half of his name and bestowed it upon them, the <italic><small>YH</small></italic> (of <italic><small>YHWH</small></italic>) in <small>THE KOHATHITE</small> (<italic><small>HQHTY</small></italic> in Numb. 4:18).<sup><xref rid="fn151">151</xref></sup> It therefore says (in Is. 48:9): <small>FOR THE SAKE OF MY NAME I WILL DELAY</small><sup><xref rid="fn152">152</xref></sup> <small>MY ANGER, &#x003C;AND FOR MY PRAISE I WILL HOLD BACK FOR YOU&#x003E; SO AS NOT TO CUT YOU OFF</small>.</p>
<title>1.31 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>. See how well the text has said (in <small>II</small> Kings 14:27): <small>AND THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One does not wish that anyone from Israel would die.<sup><xref rid="fn153">153</xref></sup> See what is written (in Is. 56:3): <small>AND LET NOT THE FOREIGNER WHO HAS ATTACHED HIMSELF TO THE LORD SPEAK, SAYING: THE LORD WILL SURELY SEPARATE ME FROM HIS PEOPLE</small>. Now if in the case of a foreigner I have promised not to reject him, how much the more so with my &#x003C;own&#x003E; children. Ergo (in I Kings 14:27): <small>THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL</small>. And so &#x003C;it was with&#x003E; the Gibeonites, who were not true proselytes but were forced proselytes<sup><xref rid="fn154">154</xref></sup> [in that they were proselytized] out of fear. &#x003C;Still&#x003E; I accepted them. Moreover, when Saul wanted to harm them and killed some of them, I killed him.<sup><xref rid="fn155">155</xref></sup> And not only that, but I sent three years famine because of him, as stated (in <small>II</small> Sam. 21:1): <small>AND THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE DAYS OF DAVID FOR THREE YEARS</small>. Now surely if I did not reject the Gibeonites who came to be with you, shall I reject my own children? Ergo (in <small>II</small> Kings 14:27): <small>AND THE LORD DID NOT RESOLVE TO BLOT OUT</small> [<small>THE NAME OF ISRAEL FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>]. And how much the more so in the case of the Levites, who minister before me? Ergo (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &#x003C;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>1.32 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>. This text is related (to Nahum 1:7): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER</small> [<small>IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE</small>]. The nature of the Holy One is unlike the nature of flesh and blood.<sup><xref rid="fn156">156</xref></sup> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, when a province rebels against him, he acts against it with an indiscriminate punishment<sup><xref rid="fn157">157</xref></sup> and kills the good along with the bad without considering: This one has sinned, and this one has not sinned. Instead he kills the whole of it (i.e., the province). Now the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when a generation provokes him, he saves the righteous and destroys the wicked. The generation of Enosh sinned. He destroyed them but rescued Enoch, as stated (in Gen. 5:24): <small>AND ENOCH WALKED WITH GOD</small>. Why? (Nahum 1:7:) <small>&#x003C;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&#x003E; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. The generation of the flood provoked him. So he destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): <small>AND HE BLOTTED OUT ALL EXISTENCE</small>; but he rescued Noah, as stated (in Gen. 6:8): <small>AND NOAH FOUND FAVOR &#x003C;IN THE EYES OF THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. And similarly with the Sodomites, he destroyed them, as stated (in Gen. 19:24): <small>THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM</small>; but he rescued Lot, as stated (in vs. 29): <small>AND SENT LOT AWAY</small>. He brought darkness upon the Egyptians, <small>BUT</small> (according to Exod. 10:23) <small>ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL HAD LIGHT IN THEIR DWELLINGS</small>. Why? (Nahum 1:7:) <small>&#x003C;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&#x003E; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. They went forth from Egypt and came to the desert. &#x003C;There&#x003E; they committed that deed (i.e., the incident of the golden calf), &#x003C;all&#x003E; except for the tribe of Levi. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>&#x003C;SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP&#x003E; AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, COME TO ME</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; What is the meaning of <small>WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD</small>? R. Simeon ben Johay says: Whoever (in Exod. 32:3) has not given a ring for idolatry, let him come unto me. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM</small>. The Holy One said (in Nahum 1:7): <small>&#x003C;THE LORD IS GOOD, A SHELTER&#x003E; IN THE DAY OF TROUBLE; HE KNOWS THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM</small>. &#x003C;Moses was asking:&#x003E; Who took part in the deed of the calf, and who did not take part? What did &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; do? He killed the sinners, as stated (in Exod. 32:35): <small>THEN THE LORD SMOTE THE PEOPLE&#x2026;</small>. With reference to the tribe of Levi, however, which gave their lives for the Name of the Holy One, he said to Moses and Aaron (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>1.33 Numbers 4:17 ff, Part VII</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 4:18:) <small>DO NOT CUT OFF</small>.] And so he says in another place (i.e., in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. But he has also said (in Numb. 1:49): <small>HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. But he only spoke to him &#x003C;with reference to numbering them in&#x003E; the midst of the children of Israel and did not tell him to exempt them from the decree &#x003C;itself&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn158">158</xref></sup> The Holy One &#x003C;did so&#x003E; because he foresaw that Israel was going to provoke him and said to them (in Numb. 14:29): <small>IN THIS DESERT SHALL YOUR CARCASSES DROP</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said: The children of Levi shall not be &#x003C;part of&#x003E; this decree, as stated (in Numb. 1:49, cont.): <small>NOR SHALL YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF THEM AS PART OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Why? Because they are mine (according to Numb. 3:12): <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BE MINE</small>. Thus when anyone offers (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) a little of himself, they advance (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) him a lot. Now they had offered (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) themselves, when Moses said (in Exod. 32:26): <small>WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD, &#x003C;COME TO ME&#x003E;</small>. And not only that, <small>BUT</small> (according to Numb. 1:50) <small>YOU SHALL ENROLL THE LEVITES TO BE OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY</small>. Thus when someone is tested in &#x003C;one&#x003E; area and found trustworthy, the Holy One trusts him forever; for so you find in the case of Joshua.<sup><xref rid="fn159">159</xref></sup> When he was tested with Amalek, he prevailed against him according to the law and according to the commandment. It is so stated (in Exod. 17:13): <small>AND JOSHUA DEFEATED &#x003C;AMALEK AND HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> The Holy One said to him: From your tribe (Ephraim) I am raising up one to exact punishment from Amalek, as stated (in Jud. 5:14): <small>OUT OF EPHRAIM CAME THOSE WHOSE ROOT IS IN AMALEK&#x2026;</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>OUT OF</small> (<italic><small>MNY</small></italic>) <small>EPHRAIM</small>?] He appointed (<italic><small>MNH</small></italic>) Ephraim in his heart<sup><xref rid="fn160">160</xref></sup> to destroy the seed of Amalek. The Holy One said to him (ibid., cont.): [<small>AFTER YOU</small>,] <small>BENJAMIN WITH YOUR PEOPLES</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; leave him for Saul ben Kish, the Benjamite; he will serve him.<sup><xref rid="fn161">161</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Jud. 5:14): <small>OUT OF EPHRAIM</small>. Saul was tested and found untrustworthy in his commission. Rather (according to I Sam. 15:9): <small>BUT SAUL AND THE PEOPLE SPARED AGAG</small>. He put him back after him (i.e., behind Ephraim, the tribe of Joshua and Samuel) and the kingdom was taken from him, as stated (in Jud. 5:14): <small>AFTER YOU</small> (i.e., Ephraim), <small>BENJAMIN WITH YOUR PEOPLES</small>. And I have also tested this tribe (of Levi), and they have been found to be preserving my honor; for they have given their life for the sanctification of my name (in Exod. 32:27-28): <small>LET EACH ONE PUT HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; SO THE CHILDREN OF LEVI ACTED ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF MOSES</small>, and they did not show mercy to them. Therefore, Moses blesses them and says to them (in Deut. 33:9): <small>WHO SAYS OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER: I DO NOT CONSIDER THEM</small> [&#x2026;.] And I am also advancing him and making him my imperial agent.<sup><xref rid="fn162">162</xref></sup> And I am entrusting him with my house and my sanctity, as stated (in Numb. 1:50): <small>BUT YOU SHALL ENROLL THE LEVITES &#x003C;TO BE OVER THE TABERNACLE OF THE TESTIMONY&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> And what was it that I told you (in vs. 49)? <small>HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. &#x003C;This prohibition&#x003E; was to exempt them from the decree which I was going to pronounce over Israel. It is simply that I am allotting them great honor. When you number them, &#x003C;number them&#x003E; by themselves through the divine utterance (in Numb. 3:15): <small>ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. Now if I have honored the Levites, who bear the Tabernacle, how much the more so in the case of the children of Kohath, who bear the ark, [as stated (in Numb. 3:31): <small>AND THEIR DUTIES INCLUDED THE ARK, THE TABLE, THE LAMPSTAND, THE ALTARS, AND THE SACRED UTENSILS&#x2026;</small>.] He therefore said to them (in Numb. 4:18): <small>DO NOT CUT OFF &#x003C;THE TRIBE OF THE KOHATHITE FAMILIES FROM THE LEVITES&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: [If] because [the children of Kohath] have feared me, I have allotted glory to them [and to their children]; then [I will honor] whoever stands in awe of me and not cut off his name from the world.<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> From whom do you learn this? From the Jonadab ben Rechab, as stated (in Jer. 35:19): <small>SOMEONE BELONGING TO JONADAB BEN RECHAB SHALL NOT BE CUT OFF &#x003C;FROM STANDING BEFORE ME FOREVER&#x003E;</small>. And if in the case of those who are proselytes, because they have done my will, I have done likewise for them (i.e., what they want); in the case of Israel, when they are doing my will, how much the more shall they neither be cut off nor have their name be erased from before me? Rather, they shall live and abide forever and ever and ever, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.</p>

<title>2.1 Numbers 5:11ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:11&#x2013;12):<sup><xref rid="fn164">1</xref></sup> <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. Let our master instruct us: When someone wanted to accuse his wife (of infidelity), how did he accuse her?<sup><xref rid="fn165">2</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in Sot. 1:4&#x2013;5; 2:2&#x2013;3.):<sup><xref rid="fn166">3</xref></sup> O<small>NE ACCUSING HIS WIFE BROUGHT HER TO THE GREAT COURT WHICH WAS IN JERUSALEM, AND THEY WOULD ADMONISH HER IN THE WAY THAT THEY WOULD ADMONISH WITNESSES IN CAPITAL CASES&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn167">4</xref></sup> Then afterwards: <small>THEY WOULD BRING HER UP TO THE EASTERN GATE, TO &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; THE GATE OF NICANOR, WHERE THEY WOULD PURIFY THE LEPERS AND GIVE DRINK TO SUSPECTED ADULTERESSES&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. A PRIEST WOULD BRING AN EARTHENWARE BOWL</small><sup><xref rid="fn168">5</xref></sup> <small>AND PUT A HALF LOG OF WATER INTO IT FROM THE BASIN&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. HE WOULD ENTER THE TEMPLE AND TURN TO HIS RIGHT. NOW A PLACE WAS THERE ONE CUBIT SQUARE WITH A MARBLE FLAGSTONE</small><sup><xref rid="fn169">6</xref></sup> <small>THERE AND A RING FIXED IN IT. HE WOULD RAISE IT, TAKE DUST FROM UNDERNEATH, AND PUT IT UPON THE WATER, AS STATED</small> (in Numb. 5:17): <small>AND TAKING SOME OF THE DUST WHICH IS IN THE FLOOR OF THE TABERNACLE, THE PRIEST SHALL PUT IT INTO THE WATER. THEN HE WOULD WRITE THE SCROLL</small> (in the wording of Numb. 5:19): <small>AND IF NO ONE HAS SLEPT WITH YOU&#x2026;</small>. From here (Numb. 5:19) our masters have taught: When one opens capital cases, you begin with &#x003C;the case for&#x003E; acquittal. Then he writes further (in vss. 20&#x2013;21): <small>AND IF YOU HAVE GONE ASTRAY &#x2026;, MAY THE LORD MAKE YOU A CURSE&#x2026;</small>. And so Solomon has said (in I Kings 8:31&#x2013;32 // II Chron. 6:22&#x2013;23): <small>WHENEVER ONE SINS AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR, AND HE GIVES HIM AN OATH FOR HIM TO SWEAR; THEN WHEN HE COMES FOR THE OATH BEFORE YOUR ALTAR IN THIS HOUSE, YOU WILL HEARKEN IN HEAVEN, TAKE ACTION, AND JUDGE YOUR SERVANT, IN ORDER TO CONDEMN THE WICKED SO AS TO SET HIS CONDUCT UPON HIS OWN HEAD AND JUSTIFY THE RIGHTEOUS SO AS TO RENDER TO HIM ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. In the parashah on the adulteress the text says what is stated (in Numb. 5:23): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE PRIEST&#x003E; SHALL WRITE DOWN THESE CURSES &#x003C;IN A SCROLL&#x003E;</small>. (I Kings 8:32 // II Chron. 6:23:) <small>YOU WILL HEARKEN IN HEAVEN, TAKE ACTION, AND JUDGE YOUR SERVANT, IN ORDER TO CONDEMN THE WICKED SO AS TO SET HIS CONDUCT UPON HIS OWN HEAD</small>. (Numb. 5:27:) <small>SO THAT HER BELLY SHALL DISTEND AND HER THIGH SHALL SAG</small>. (I Kings 8:32/II Chron. 6:23:) <small>AND JUSTIFY THE RIGHTEOUS SO AS TO RENDER TO HIM ACCORDING TO HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. (Numb. 5:28): <small>BUT IF THE WOMAN HAS NOT DEFILED HERSELF AND IS PURE, SHE SHALL BE GUILTLESS AND SHALL CONCEIVE SEED</small>. If she was defiled, (according to <italic>Sot.</italic> 3:4; 5:1) <small>SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FINISHED DRINKING BEFORE HER FACE TURNS GREEN, HER EYES PROTRUDE, AND SHE IS FULL OF &#x003C;SWOLLEN&#x003E; VEINS. THEN THE PRIEST SAYS: TAKE HER OUT, TAKE HER OUT, SO THAT SHE DOES NOT DEFLE THE TEMPLE COURT&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. JUST AS THE WATER TESTS THE WOMAN, SO DOES THE WATER TEST THE MAN, SINCE IT IS STATED &#x003C;TWICE&#x003E;</small> (in Numb. 5:22 &#x0026; 24): <small>AND IT</small> (i.e., the water that causes the curse&#x003E; <small>SHALL GO&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. AND IT SHALL GO &#x003C;INTO HER &#x2026; &#x003E;. JUST AS SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO HER HUSBAND, SO IS SHE FORBIDDEN TO THE LOVER, SINCE IT IS STATED &#x003C;TWICE&#x003E;</small> (in Numb. 5:13 &#x0026; 14): <small>SHE HAS DEFILED HERSELF&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;. SHE HAS DEFILED HERSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn170">7</xref></sup> If, however, she drinks &#x003C;the potion&#x003E; and is found pure, then if she was barren, she is &#x003C;now&#x003E; visited (i.e., given conception).<sup><xref rid="fn171">8</xref></sup> &#x003C;If&#x003E; she used [to] bear ugly &#x003C;children&#x003E;, she &#x003C;now&#x003E; bears beautiful ones. &#x003C;Instead of&#x003E; dark &#x003C;children&#x003E;, she bears fair ones. &#x003C;Instead of&#x003E; short &#x003C;children&#x003E;, she bears tall ones. &#x003C;Instead of&#x003E; females, she bears males. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 5:28): <small>BUT IF THE WOMAN HAS NOT DEFILED HERSELF AND IS PURE, SHE SHALL BE GUILTLESS AND SHALL CONCEIVE SEED</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: Write a section on the adulteress so that she may know which name the priest blots out for her,<sup><xref rid="fn172">9</xref></sup> what is to be her death, and how it will be made public.<sup><xref rid="fn173">10</xref></sup> Where is it shown? &#x007B;Where it is stated&#x007D; [from what they have read on the matter] (in Numb. 5:12): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>.</p>

<title>2.3 Numbers 5:11ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:12:) <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>.] This text is related (to Prov. 6:16): <small>SIX THINGS THE LORD HATES</small>, [<small>AND SEVEN ARE AN ABOMINATION FOR HIS SOUL</small>]. R. Jose the Galilean says:<sup><xref rid="fn176">13</xref></sup> &#x003C;These&#x003E; seven things<sup><xref rid="fn177">14</xref></sup> were said about the adulteress. (Prov. 6:17:) HAUGHTY EYES, in that the adulterous woman raises her eyes to another man; and so it says (in Is. 3:16): <small>BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION ARE HAUGHTY, AND WALK WITH EXTENDED NECK AND ROVING EYES</small>. (Prov. 6:17, cont.:) <small>A LYING TONGUE</small>, in that she commits adultery with another man and becomes pregnant from him, then lies and says to her husband: I am pregnant from you. (Prov. 6:17, cont.:) <small>HANDS THAT SHED INNOCENT BLOOD</small>, in that the adulterer goes in on condition that, if he is caught, he will kill or be killed. (Prov. 6:18:) <small>A HEART DEVISING WICKED THOUGHTS</small>, in that the adulterer and the adulteress have thoroughly wicked thoughts all the time, when they sin in telling each other in which place and at what time. (Prov. 6:18, cont.:) <small>FEET QUICK</small> (<italic>memaharot</italic>) <small>TO RUN TO EVIL</small>, in that they certainly are hastening (<italic>memaharim</italic>) to commit the sin. (Prov. 6:19:) <small>A FALSE WITNESS THAT SPREADS A LIE</small>, in that, if they are caught, they speak falsely and lie, when they swear and say: We were talking about other things. (Prov. 6:19, cont.:) <small>AND ONE THAT INSTIGATES A QUARREL AMONG BROTHERS</small>, in that all Israel are brothers; and in the case of one who commits adultery with his friend&#x2019;s wife, when her husband hears of it, he hates him. Moreover, this person cannot look at him. Ergo: <small>AND ONE THAT INSTIGATES A QUARREL AMONG BROTHERS</small>. Ergo: &#x003C;There are&#x003E; seven injurious things which &#x007B;whoredom&#x007D; [the adulteress] does.</p>
<title>2.4 Numbers 5:11ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Our masters have said in the name of R. Hanina the father of R. Aha: The adulterer and adulteress transgress the ten commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn178">15</xref></sup> He said to them: In the case of nine, we admit &#x003C;transgressing them&#x003E;; but how is it so in the case of &#x003C;the commandment concerning&#x003E; the Sabbath?</p>
<ol>
<li>In the case of (Exod. 20:2 &#x003D; Deut. 5:6:) I <small>&#x003C;AM THE LORD YOUR GOD&#x003E;</small>, because anyone who commits adultery with the wife of his acquaintance is, as it were, denying the Holy One. It is so stated (in Jer. 5:8, 12): <small>&#x003C;THEY WERE WELL-FED, LUSTY STALLIONS, EACH NEIGHING AT HIS NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S WIFE&#x2026;. &#x003E; THEY HAVE DENIED THE LORD AND SAID: HE DOES NOT EXIST</small>.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:2 &#x003D; Deut. 5:7:) <small>&#x003C;YOU&#x003E; SHALL HAVE NO &#x003C;OTHER GODS&#x003E;</small>, since it is written of him (in Exod. 20:5 &#x003D; Deut. 5:9): <small>FOR</small> [<small>I</small>] <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD AM A JEALOUS GOD</small>. Also it is stated two times concerning the adulteress (in Numb. 5:14): <small>IF THE SPIRIT OF JEALOUSY CAME OVER HIM, AND HE IS JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE</small>. But why two times? Because it (i.e., the meal offering of the next verse)<sup><xref rid="fn179">16</xref></sup> excites jealousy for the Holy One and for her husband, as stated (in Numb. 5:15): <small>FOR IT IS A MEAL OFFERING OF JEALOUSY</small>. Thus it is a case of two jealousies.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:7 &#x003D; Deut. 5:11:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD &#x003C;IN VAIN&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;One breaks this commandment&#x003E; because he commits adultery and swears in vain that he has not done so.</li>
<li>(On this commandment, see the end of the paragraph.)</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:12 &#x003D; Deut. 5:16:) <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER</small>. When one commits adultery with the adulteress, she becomes pregnant from him. Then she says to her husband: I am pregnant from you. When the fetus is grown, it honors her husband, &#x003C;since it&#x003E; thinks that he is its father. Moreover, &#x003C;the grown child&#x003E; passes through the market and scorns the adulterer, since he thinks that he is not his father.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:13 &#x003D; Deut. 5:17:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT MURDER</small>. The adulterer goes in on condition that, if he is caught, he will kill or be killed.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:13, cont. &#x003D; Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small>. Obviously &#x003C;this commandment is broken&#x003E;, because he is committing adultery.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:13, cont. &#x003D; Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</small>. &#x003C;This commandment is broken&#x003E; because he is stealing his neighbor&#x2019;s spring (i.e., his wife&#x2019;s womb), and so it says (in Prov. 9:17): <small>STOLEN WATERS ARE SWEET&#x2026;</small>.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:13, cont. // Deut. 5:17, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT BEAR &#x003C;FALSE WITNESS&#x003E; AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>. &#x003C;The commandment is broken&#x003E; in that &#x003C;the adulteress&#x003E; bears false witness [to her husband] and says: I am pregnant from you.</li>
<li>(Exod. 20:14; cf. Deut. 5:18:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR&#x2019;</small>s <small>HOUSE, AND YOU SHALL NOT COVET YOUR NEIGHBOR&#x2019;</small>s <small>WIFE</small>. &#x003C;The commandment is broken&#x003E; because whoever covets his friend&#x2019;s wife and commits adultery with her, covets everything that belongs to his friend.<sup><xref rid="fn180">17</xref></sup> How? When he continues committing adultery with her and she bears &#x003C;a child&#x003E; from him, her husband thinks that it came from himself. When he comes to depart from the world, he thinks that this son is his and writes him a will<sup><xref rid="fn181">18</xref></sup> of all his assets. So he bequeaths to him whatever he has without knowing that he is not his son. It turns out that the adulterer covets whatever belongs to his friend.</li>
</ol>
<p>They said to R. Hanina: Here we have told you nine &#x003C;commandments&#x003E;. In regard to&#x003E; (Exod. 20:8; cf. Deut. 5:12:) [<small>REMEMBER</small>] <small>THE SABBATH</small> [<small>DAY</small>]. How does he transgress against it? He said to them: I will tell you: Sometimes when a priest has a priestly wife, and a &#x003C;lay&#x003E; Israelite adulterer has sexual intercourse with her, so that she bears &#x003C;a child&#x003E; from him, they consider him (i.e., the child) to be the son of a priest. Then when the baby goes on to minister in the Temple, arrange wood, and sacrifice on the Sabbath, he is found to be profaning the Sabbath. Hence there are ten commandments which the adulteress breaks with the adulterer. Solomon also has said concerning her (in Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND</small> [<small>THE WOMAN</small>] <small>MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>, [<small>&#x003C;THE WOMAN&#x003E; WHO HAS SNARES AND NETS &#x003C;IN HER HEART&#x003E;</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>SNARES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>WD</small></italic>)? She lies in wait (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>WD</small></italic>) in this world and for the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn182">19</xref></sup> <small>AND NETS</small>? The net catches &#x003C;prey&#x003E; in the water but does not catch &#x003C;any&#x003E; on dry land. The woman, however, catches &#x003C;her prey&#x003E; in the sea and on the dry land.<sup><xref rid="fn183">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND &#x003C;THE WOMAN&#x003E; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. If a person is worthy, (according to Prov. 18:22) <small>THE ONE WHO HAS FOUND A WIFE HAS FOUND HAPPINESS</small>; but if not, (Eccl. 7:26:) <small>AND I FIND &#x003C;THE WOMAN&#x003E; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. (Eccl. 7:26:) <small>THE WOMAN</small> (&#x2019;<italic><small>S</small>h<small>H</small></italic>). When she is good, (Prov. 31:10:) <small>WHAT A FIND IS A GALLANT WIFE</small> (from &#x2019;<italic><small>S</small>h<small>H</small></italic>)&#x0021; When she is bad, (Eccl. 7:26:) <small>AND I FIND &#x003C;THE WOMAN&#x003E; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. (Eccl. 7:26, cont.:) <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. This refers to Joseph. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers ot Zimri (of Numb. 25:6&#x2013;15). Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): [<small>ONE WHO IS GOOD</small>.] This refers to Boaz, when he says to Ruth (in Ruth 3:13): <small>SPEND THE NIGHT</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers to Samson. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. This refers to Palti (of I Sam. 25:44).<sup><xref rid="fn184">21</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. This refers to Absalom.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>HE WHO IS GOOD BEFORE GOD ESCAPES HER</small>. &#x003C;These words refer to&#x003E; whoever sees an adulterous woman and flees from her. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT A SINNER IS TAKEN BY HER</small>. &#x003C;These words refer to&#x003E; whoever is captivated by her. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 5:12): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 7:26): <small>AND I FIND &#x003C;THE WOMAN &#x003E; MORE BITTER THAN DEATH</small>. Not to be loud, arrogant of gait, or bawdy in laughter: This is the way of the daughters of Israel. But if &#x003C;a woman&#x003E; was bawdy in the presence of one of them, one would warn her on the evidence of two [witnesses and say to her]: Why should you be laughing with so and so? Why should you be speaking with him? If she has &#x003C;merely&#x003E; spoken &#x003C;with him&#x003E; up to now, she is allowed into her house and may eat the <italic>Terumah.</italic> [&#x003C;If&#x003E; she has entered with him in secret and lingered to be defiled, she is forbidden her house and eating the <italic>Terumah</italic>.]</p>
<title>2.5 Numbers 5:11ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:15:) <small>THEN HE SHALL BRING THE OFFERING FOR HER, ONE-TENTH AN EPHAH OF BARLEY MEAL</small>. Why does she bring barley meal?<sup><xref rid="fn185">22</xref></sup> Because she behaved in the manner of a beast with him, she therefore brings the food of a beast as her offering. [(Ibid. cont.:) <small>HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT</small>.: Why does he not pour oil upon it?<sup><xref rid="fn186">23</xref></sup> Because the oil is a light but is &#x003C;also&#x003E; called <italic>yitshar</italic> (a word which can mean &#x201C;it will shine&#x201D;); while this woman loves the darkness. Therefore (in Numb. 5:15): <small>HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT</small>. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOR SHALL HE PUT FRANKINCENSE UPON IT</small>.] Why does he not put frankincense upon it? Because the frankincense is a remembrance of the matriarchs, [as stated] (in Cant. 4:6): <small>I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE</small>, while this woman has withdrawn from their ways. She would therefore be a reminder of iniquity and not a reminder of merit. (Numb. 5:17): <small>THEN THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE HOLY WATER IN AN EARTHEN VESSEL AND SOME OF THE DUST WHICH IS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TABERNACLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn187">24</xref></sup> He was created from the dust, and she was formed from the water.<sup><xref rid="fn188">25</xref></sup> For that reason she was tested by water and by dust as to whether she was as pure as when she was created or not. And again, why is she tested with water and with dust? Because they are her witnesses. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 30:19): <small>I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why is she tested with water [and with dust]? Because a person who &#x007B;knows&#x007D; [sows] some seeds in the dust does not know what they are, until the water comes down upon them and makes known whether they belong to the owner of the field, or &#x003C;whether they are&#x003E; what others have sown.</p>
<title>2.6 Numbers 5:11ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 5:12): <small>IF</small> [<small>ANY</small>]<small>ONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. This text is related (to Job 24:15): <small>ALSO THE EYE OF AN ADULTERER WATCHES FOR TWILIGHT, SAYING: NO EYE SHALL SEE ME</small>. And so the adulterer says: No human being knows about me; but the Holy One has his eyes ranging over all the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn189">26</xref></sup> So it says (in Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small>? Such is the way of those who commit transgression. They wait for a time of darkness, so that no one will see them. It is therefore stated (in Job 24:15): <small>THE EYE OF THE ADULTERER WATCHES FOR TWILIGHT</small>. So also thieves watch for an hour of darkness, as stated (in vs. 16): <small>HE BREAKS INTO HOUSES IN THE DARK</small>. And so it says (in Is. 29:15): <small>WOE TO THOSE WHO DELVE DEEPLY TO HIDE A PLAN FROM THE LORD, FOR THEIR WORKS ARE IN DARKNESS</small>. [<small>SO THEY SAY: WHO SEES US? AND WHO KNOWS ABOUT US?</small>] The thief and the adulterer are obdurate, because they dismiss the Divine Presence. The Holy One fills, as it were, the realms above and the realms below, as stated (in Jer. 23:24): <small>DO I NOT FILL HEAVEN AND EARTH, SAYS THE LORD</small>? Also in regard to the place where adulterer comes to commit adultery, is not the Holy One there in his glory? It is so stated (in Is. 6:3): <small>THE WHOLE EARTH IS FULL OF HIS GLORY</small>. Now the adulterer says to the Holy One: Remove yourself, and give way to me for a while. The matter is exceedingly difficult, as it were. Since he is full of mercy, slow to anger, he gives way to him; <small>FOR</small> (according to Job 11:11) <small>HE KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE WORTHLESS</small>; [<small>SO WHEN HE SEES INIQUITY, DOES HE NOT DISCERN IT</small>?] It also says (in Job 24:15, cont.): <small>HE</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn190">27</xref></sup> Ergo (in Job 24:15): <small>WHEN THE EYE OF AN ADULTERER WATCHES &#x003C;FOR TWILIGHT, SAYING: NO EYE SHALL SEE ME&#x003E;</small>, what does the Holy One do? <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>. He puts the face of &#x003C;the&#x003E; adulterer on that fetus.<sup><xref rid="fn191">28</xref></sup> While the adulterer and the adulteress do not want her to become pregnant but only satisfy their sexual desire, the Holy One proclaims<sup><xref rid="fn192">29</xref></sup> them to the world. Ergo: <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>, so that the people may know &#x003C;about him&#x003E; and say: Surely this one&#x2019;s face resembles the face of &#x003C;the&#x003E; adulterer; for &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; has formed formed the image of the fetus in the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (ibid.): <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>. It is therefore called whoredom (<italic>zimmah</italic>); for when they both deny and say: We do not know what you are saying, the people say: If so, what is this (<italic>zeh mah</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn193">30</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: The power of the adulterer is strong, because it weakens the power of the Divine Presence. How? When the fetus is conceived from the husband, the Holy One forms its image in forty days, for thus have our masters taught: In forty days the image of the fetus is recognizable. After forty days, when the adulterer comes into her, the Holy One stands dumfounded and says: After whom shall I form &#x003C;the fetus&#x003E;? The image (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></italic>) of the husband or the image [of the adulterer]? (According to Deut. 32:18): <small>YOU</small>, as it were, <small>WERE UNMINDFUL OF</small> (<italic><small>TS</small>h<small>Y</small></italic>) <small>THE ROCK</small> (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></italic>) <small>THAT BORE YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn194">31</xref></sup> The <italic>yod</italic> (&#x003D; <italic><small>Y</small></italic>) is tiny (the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet). &#x003C;Thus, you&#x003E; weaken (<italic><small>TS</small>h</italic>, without the <italic>yod</italic>) the hands (<italic>yad</italic> in the dual) of the Creator (<italic>tsayyar</italic>). R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To an sculptor (<italic>tsayyar</italic>, rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>YR</small></italic>), who was fashioning (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>YR</small></italic>) an image<sup><xref rid="fn195">32</xref></sup> of a king. When he came to finish the face,<sup><xref rid="fn196">33</xref></sup> they said to him: The king is dead, and another king has arisen. When the sculptor heard that, shrugged his shoulders.<sup><xref rid="fn197">34</xref></sup> He began to say: What shall I do with these colors<sup><xref rid="fn198">35</xref></sup> which I have on hand? Shall I fashion &#x003C;them&#x003E; in the form of the former king or in the form of the second king? He began to be bewildered. Now similarly, when the husband performs his marital duty with his wife, the Holy One forms the fetus in the likeness of its father. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; in turn the adulterer comes into her. Ergo, the colors are mingled. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 4:2): <small>SWEARING, LYING, MURDERING, STEALING, COMMITTING ADULTERY BREAK OUT; BLOODSHED FOLLOWS BLOODSHED</small>. What does the Holy One do? He returns, as it were, and changes the face into the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (in Job 24:15) <small>HE TURNS A SECRET INTO A FACE</small>.</p>
<title>2.7 Numbers 5:11ff., Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:12:) <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small> (<italic>tisteh</italic>). Our masters have taught: The adulterers do not commit adultery, until a spirit of madness (<italic>shetut</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn199">36</xref></sup> enters them.<sup><xref rid="fn200">37</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (ibid.): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. &#x003C;Here&#x003E; we have learned about the woman. Where is shown about the man? Where it is stated (in Prov. 6:32): <small>THE ONE WHO COMMITS ADULTERY WITH A WOMAN IS HAS NO SENSE</small> (literally: <small>IS LACKING HEART</small>); <small>&#x003C;THE ONE WHO DOES SO DESTROYS HIS OWN LIFE&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn201">38</xref></sup></p>
<title>2.8 Numbers 5:11ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:12:) <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small>?&#x2026;. [R. Benjamin b. R. Levi said:] The Holy One said: If someone performs a deed, do I not see him?<sup><xref rid="fn202">39</xref></sup> Here it is written (in Zech. 4:10; cf. II Chron. 16:9): <small>&#x003C;THESE SEVEN ARE&#x003E; THE EYES OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. What is written (in Jer. 23:24)? <small>SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small> (<italic>ar&#x2019;ennu</italic>)? &#x003C;Interpret these words<sup><xref rid="fn203">40</xref></sup> as follows:&#x003E; <small>SHALL I NOT SHOW HIM</small> (<italic>ar&#x2019;ennu</italic>) to the people and publish his works? What is the meaning of (Jer. 23:24, cont.): <small>DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? SAYS THE LORD</small>? The Holy One said: I fill the realms above and the realms below; therefore it is stated (in Jer. 23:24): <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES, &#x003C;SHALL I NOT SEE HIM&#x003E;</small>?</p>
<p>Another interpretation of (Jer. 23:24): <small>&#x003C;IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES&#x003E;, SHALL I NOT SEE HIM</small>? It is comparable to an architect<sup><xref rid="fn204">41</xref></sup> &#x003C;who&#x003E; went out as a &#x007B;<italic>katarikon</italic>&#x007D; [&#x003C;<italic>katadikon</italic>&#x003E;<italic>]</italic> &#x007B;i.e., as &#x201C;one who imposes fines&#x201D; in the Greek language&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn205">42</xref></sup> over a certain provincial capital. The inhabitants of the capital began hiding their silver and gold within the very hidden treasuries &#x003C;that he had built&#x003E;. The architect said to them: I built the capital, and I made the hidden treasuries. Will you hide &#x003C;anything&#x003E; from me? Similarly, the Holy One has said to adulterers: Will you hide yourselves from me? (Jer. 23:24:) <small>IF SOMEONE HIDES IN SECRET PLACES</small>, I have created you and made your every cavity (<italic>mehilim mehilim</italic>). [It is so stated] (in Deut. 32:18): <small>BUT YOU FORGOT THE GOD WHO GENERATED YOU</small> (<italic>meholelekha</italic>). Nothing will be useful to you, wherever you hide yourselves, because (according to Jer. 17:10:) <small>I THE LORD SEARCH THE HEART, PROBE THE KIDNEYS, TO RENDER TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS WAYS, ACCORDING TO THE FRUIT OF HIS DEEDS</small>. I am the one who brings (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) you to judgment, as stated (in Mal. 3:5): <small>THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) &#x007B;<small>WITH</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>YOU IN JUDGMENT; &#x003C;AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small> Therefore, you shall not go astray after the evil drive, so that none of you have his wife go astray, according to what is stated (in Numb. 5:12): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>.</p>
<title>2.9 Numbers 5:11ff., Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:12:) <small>IF ANYONE</small> (literally: <small>IF A MAN A MAN</small>) <small>HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach you that she is going astray and being false with two men, with a man above and with a man below.<sup><xref rid="fn206">43</xref></sup> With a man (<italic>ish</italic>) above, &#x003C;i.e., the Holy One, since&#x003E; (according to Exod. 15:3) <small>THE LORD IS A MAN</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>OF WAR</small>. And with a man below, i.e., her husband (<italic>ish</italic>).</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 5:12): <small>IF ANYONE HAS HIS WIFE GO ASTRAY</small>. The Holy One said to her: You are laughing at your husband below. Do [you] suppose you could &#x007B;betray&#x007D; [laugh at] me? A parable: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn207">44</xref></sup> To someone who was imprisoned within two houses, one inside the other. Now two guards were there, one on the inside and one on the outside. &#x003C;The prisoner&#x003E; opened &#x003C;door of&#x003E; the inner &#x003C;house&#x003E; and left, but the guard did not notice him. When he came to leave the outer one, &#x003C;the guard&#x003E; did notice him. He seized him &#x003C;and&#x003E; said to him: At that &#x003C;guard&#x003E; on the inside you laughed, but at me you cannot laugh. Similarly the Holy One has said to the adulterous woman: At your husband you laugh, but at me you cannot laugh. Rather I sit and laugh at my creatures. It is so stated (in Ps. 2:4): <small>THE ONE SITTING IN THE HEAVENS SHALL LAUGH</small>.</p>
<title>2.10 Numbers 5:11ff., Part X</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:13:) <small>IN THAT A MAN HAS SLEPT WITH HER CARNALLY</small>, except for a minor, since he is not a man.<sup><xref rid="fn208">45</xref></sup> [<small>WITH HER</small>] <small>CARNALLY</small>. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; when her sleeping renders her unfit, and no other sleeping renders her unfit. &#x003C;There is&#x003E; a story about two sisters who resembled each other. Now one was married in one city and the other was married in another city. The husband of one of them wanted to accuse her of infidelity and have her drink the bitter water in Jerusalem. They went to that city where her married sister was. Her sister said to her: What was your reason for coming here? She said to her: My husband wants to have me drink &#x003C;the bitter water&#x003E;. Her sister said to her: I will go in your place and drink it. She said to her: Go. She put on her sister&#x2019;s clothes, went in her place, drank the bitter water, and was found clean. When she returned to her sister&#x2019;s house, she joyfully went out to meet her, then embraced and kissed her. As soon as the one kissed the other, she smelled the bitter water and immediately died, in order to fulfill what is stated (in Eccl. 8:8): <small>NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND TO CONTAIN THE WIND, NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH&#x2026;.</small></p>

These words mean that&#x003E; her husband would not have viewed &#x003C;her transgression&#x003E; and overlooked &#x003C;it&#x003E;. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO THAT SHE IS UNDETECTED</small>. We have not yet heard of a specific length of time for her to be in seclusion (with her lover) &#x003C;in order to cause defilement&#x003E;. R. Eleazer says: &#x003C;The time needed&#x003E; for a palm tree to sway back.<sup><xref rid="fn210">47</xref></sup> R. Joshua says: For mixing the cup. Ben &#x2018;Azzay says: For drinking it. R. Aqiva says: For roasting an Egg. R. Judah says: For eating three eggs one after the other. R. Eleazar ben Pinhas says: For a weaver<sup><xref rid="fn211">48</xref></sup> to knot the thread.<sup><xref rid="fn212">49</xref></sup> Hanan says: For her to put her finger in her mouth. Pelimo says: For his (sic) hand<sup><xref rid="fn213">50</xref></sup> to reach over the basket and take a loaf of bread. Even though there is no evidence for the affair, there is a hint of the affair where it is stated (in Prov. 6:26): <small>FOR ON BEHALF OF A WOMAN PLAYING THE HARLOT &#x003C;ONE WILL BE REDUCED&#x003E; TO A LOAF OF BREAD</small>.</p>
<title>2.12 Numbers 5:11ff., Part XII</title>
<p>(Numb. 5:13, cont.:) <small>AND THERE IS NO WITNESS AGAINST HER</small>. Although she has no &#x003C;witness against her&#x003E; now, she will have one at another time.<sup><xref rid="fn214">51</xref></sup> In a similar usage<sup><xref rid="fn215">52</xref></sup> you say (in Gen. 11:30): <small>NOW SARAI WAS BARREN; SHE HAD NO CHILD</small>. Although &#x003C;Sarai&#x003E; had no &#x003C;child&#x003E; then, she would have one at another time, as stated (in Gen. 21:1): <small>THEN THE LORD VISITED SARAH&#x2026;</small>. In a similar usage you say (in Esth. 2:10): <small>ESTHER HAD NOT DISCLOSED &#x003C;HER PEOPLE AND HER NATIVE LAND&#x003E;</small>. Although she had not disclosed them to him then, she did disclose them to him at another time, as stated (in Esth. 8:1): <small>THEN MORDECAI CAME BEFORE THE KING, FOR ESTHER HAD DISCLOSED WHAT RELATIONSHIP HE HAD TO HER</small>. And here also (in Numb. 5:13): <small>AND THERE IS NO WITNESS AGAINST HER</small>. Although she has no &#x003C;witness against her&#x003E; now, she will have one at anther time, as stated (in Mal. 3:5): <small>AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS</small> [<small>AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS</small>] &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</p>
<title>2.13 Numbers 5:11ff., Part XIII</title>
<p>Our masters have said: When a woman is alone with her husband and he is having sexual intercourse with her, if she sets her eyes on another at the time of &#x003C;their&#x003E; sexual intercourse, no adultery for her is greater than this.<sup><xref rid="fn216">53</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 16:32): <small>THE ADULTEROUS WOMAN</small> [<small>RECEIVES STRANGERS</small>] <small>INSTEAD OF HER HUSBAND</small> (literally: <small>UNDER HER HUSBAND</small>). Is there a woman who commits adultery &#x003C;while&#x003E; under her husband?<sup><xref rid="fn217">54</xref></sup> It is simply that this is &#x003C;the kind of woman&#x003E; who encounters a certain man and sets her eyes on him. Then she has sexual intercourse with her husband while her heart is on him. The king of the Arabs asked R. Aqiva: I am black and my wife is black, but she has borne me a white son. Shall I kill her because she has played the harlot while under me? He said to him: Do you have images within your house? He said to him: Yes. He said to him: Are your household images white or black? He said to him: White. He said to him: When you were busy with her, she set her eyes on the images and bore &#x003C;a child&#x003E; like them. Now if you are surprised over this matter, learn from the Jacob&#x2019;s flock. They were conceived from the sticks, as stated (in Gen. 30:39): <small>SINCE THE FLOCK CONCEIVED BY THE STICKS, &#x003C;THE FLOCK BORE STREAKED, SPECKLED, AND SPOTTED YOUNG&#x003E;</small>. Then the king of the Arabs thanked R. Aqiva. Thus, when any woman is alone with her husband in holiness, in the end he produces righteous children from her. Thus we find it so in the case of Hannah. When she was alone with her husband in holiness, the Holy One did not deprive her of her reward. Rather he gave her a righteous son like Moses, as stated (in Jer. 15:1): <small>EVEN IF MOSES AND SAMUEL STOOD BEFORE ME</small>. It also says (in Ps. 99:6): <small>MOSES AND AARON WERE AMONG HIS PRIESTS, AND SAMUEL WAS AMONG THOSE WHO CALL UPON HIS NAME</small>. So also did Hannah say (in I Sam. 1:27): <small>FOR THIS CHILD DID I PRAY, AND THE LORD HAS GRANTED ME MY PETITION</small>. Why? Because he was sown in holiness. The Holy One said: In this world I abhor all those peoples, because they are from unclean seed; but I have chosen you, because you are from true seed, as stated (in Jer. 2:21): <small>AND I PLANTED YOU AS A CHOICE VINE, ALL OF IT FROM TRUE SEED</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 7:6): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU</small>. And also in the age to come I am choosing only you, because you are a holy seed, as stated (in Is. 65:23): <small>THEY SHALL NOT LABOR IN VAIN, NOR BEAR CHILDREN IN TERROR&#x003E;</small>, [<small>BECAUSE THEY ARE A SEED BLESSED OF THE LORD</small>,] <small>&#x003C;AND THEIR OFFSPRING ALONG WITH THEM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>2.14 Numbers 6:22ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 6:22&#x2013;23:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE</small> [<small>UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO AARON AND UNTO HIS CHILDREN, SAYING</small>:] <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Let our master instruct us: In the case of priest with a blemish, it is right for him to raise his hands (in the priestly blessing)?<sup><xref rid="fn218">55</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Meg</italic>. 4:7): <small>A PRIEST WHOSE HANDS ARE BLEMISHED MAY NOT RAISE HIS HANDS</small>, but Rabbi taught: A priest whose has any blemishes at all may not raise his hands. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>R. JUDAH SAYS: ALSO WHOEVER HAS HIS HANDS STAINED WITH WOAD</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn219">56</xref></sup> <small>MADDER, OR RUBIA MAY NOT RAISE HIS HANDS</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR PEOPLE TO BE LOOKING AT HIM</small>. R. Joshua the Great taught: If the majority of the men in the town are in that business (i.e., of dying cloth), he is permitted to raise his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn220">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>. The Holy One said: From the beginning I have blessed my people; from now on the blessings are transmitted to you. You were to bless my children; therefore the Holy One told Moses to caution Aaron and his children to bless Israel. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [From where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter] (in Numb. 6:23): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON AND UNTO HIS CHILDREN, SAYING</small>:] <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.</p>
<title>2.15 Numbers 6:22ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.] This text is related (to Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, FROM THE HEAVENS, AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE</small>. And in the same vein David says (in II Sam. 7:29): <small>SO NOW MAY YOU BE PLEASED TO BLESS YOUR SERVANT&#x2019;S HOUSE, THAT IT ABIDE BEFORE YOU FOREVER&#x2026;. AND MAY YOUR SERVANT</small>&#x2019;s <small>HOUSE BE BLESSED FOR EVER WITH YOUR BLESSING</small>&#x007B;<small>S</small>&#x007D;. The congregation of Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, you tell your priests to bless us.<sup><xref rid="fn221">58</xref></sup> We only need you to bless us. (Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, FROM THE HEAVENS, &#x003C;AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to them: Although I have told the priests to bless you, I am standing along with them and blessing you. For that reason the priests spread their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn222">59</xref></sup> &#x003C;They do so&#x003E; to say: The Holy One is standing behind us. So also it says (with reference to the Holy One in Cant. 2:9) <small>THERE HE STANDS BEHIND OUR WALL, GAZING THROUGH THE WINDOWS, PEERING THROUGH THE LATTICE</small>, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; <small>GAZING THROUGH THE WINDOWS</small>, from between the fingers of the priests; <small>PEERING THROUGH THE LATTICE</small>, when they extend their hands. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.</p>
<title>2.16 Numbers 6:22ff., Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 3:7): <small>THERE IS HIS BED, THE ONE BELONGING TO SOLOMON</small> (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></italic>), <small>WITH SIXTY WARRIORS AROUND IT</small>. What reason did &#x003C;the author of Canticles, i.e.,&#x003E; Solomon (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></italic>), have to be concerned with a with a bed?<sup><xref rid="fn223">60</xref></sup> When it said: <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>, it is simply that &#x003C;the verse&#x003E; was only concerned with the king to whom peace (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>LM</small></italic>) belonged. (Ibid.:) <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>. This is the Temple.<sup><xref rid="fn224">61</xref></sup> But why was the Temple compared to a bed? It is simply that just as a bed is only for being fruitful and multiplying, so it was with the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying, as stated (in I Kings 8:8 &#x003D; II Chron. 5:9): <small>THE POLES GREW SO LONG</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn225">62</xref></sup> It also says (in II Chron. 3:6): <small>THE GOLD WAS GOLD FROM PARVAIM</small> (as if from <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>), which produced fruit (rt.: <italic><small>PRH</small></italic>). And so it says (in I Kings 7:2): <small>AND HE BUILT THE HOUSE OF THE FOREST OF LEBANON</small>. Why was it compared to a forest? Just as a forest is fruitful and multiplies, so it is in the case of the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying. It is therefore stated (in Cant. 3:7): <small>THERE IS HIS BED</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WITH SIXTY WARRIORS</small>. These are the sixty letters that are in the priestly blessing (in Numb. 6:24&#x2013;26). (Cant. 3:8:) <small>ALL OF THEM EQUIPPED WITH A SWORD</small>, because in each and every &#x003C;verse of the priestly blessing&#x003E; the name of the Holy One is mentioned: <small>THE LORD</small><sup><xref rid="fn226">63</xref></sup> <small>BLESS YOU &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;; THE LORD MAKE &#x003C;HIS FACE&#x003E; SHINE&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;; THE LORD LIFT UP HIS &#x003C;FACE &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>. (Cant. 3:8, cont.:) <small>EACH WITH HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH</small>. What is the reason for the thigh to be mentioned here? simply that, even if one sees in his dream a sword being drawn, placed over his neck, and &#x003C;then&#x003E; cutting off his thigh, he rises early in the morning and goes to the synagogue.<sup><xref rid="fn227">64</xref></sup> (Cant. 3:8, cont.:) <small>BECAUSE OF FEAR AT NIGHT</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; because of a fear which he saw in his dream at night. Then &#x003C;when&#x003E; he sees the priests raising their hands, the bad dream passes away from him. It is therefore stated: <small>BECAUSE OF FEAR AT NIGHT</small>. Therefore the holy one told moses to caution Aaron and his children to bless my children, as stated (in numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>].</p>
<title>2.17 Numbers 6:22ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small>.] The Holy One said: In the past I needed to bless my creatures.<sup><xref rid="fn228">65</xref></sup> I blessed the first Adam and his wife, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM&#x2026;</small>. I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. I blessed Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING</small>. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; the Holy One said: From now on behold, the blessings are being delivered to you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING</small>. What did Abraham do? He begot two &#x003C;children&#x003E;, Ishmael and Isaac, but he did not bless them. A parable:<sup><xref rid="fn229">66</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard<sup><xref rid="fn230">67</xref></sup> &#x003C;and&#x003E; gave it to a tenant. Now in the midst of that orchard was a one tree with an elixir of life and another tree with the elixir of death grafted upon it. The tenant said: If I water the tree with the elixir of life, the tree with the elixir of death will drink. The tenant said: I shall work and finish my time. Then whatever the king wants to do in his garden he may do.<sup><xref rid="fn231">68</xref></sup> The king is the Holy One, and the garden is the world. The Holy One delivered it to Abraham. He said to him (in Gen. 12:2): <small>AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING</small>. What did Abraham do? He had two children, one righteous and one wicked, Ishmael and Isaac. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will want me to bless him, and he is wicked. I am only flesh and blood. When I depart from the world, the Holy One will do his will. When Abraham did depart, the Holy One revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC</small>. Then Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 49:28): <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, TWELVE IN NUMBER, &#x003C;AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM WHEN HE BLESSED THEM &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>. From now on, said the Holy One, behold, the blessings are being delivered to you; and the priests will bless my children.</p>
<title>2.18 Numbers 6:22ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. (Vs. 24:) <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. Along with the blessing there is the keeping. <small>&#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; BLESS YOU</small> by keeping &#x003C;you&#x003E; in abundance.<sup><xref rid="fn232">69</xref></sup> <small>AND KEEP YOU</small>, so that may do good works (<italic>mitswot</italic>). (vs. 25:) <small>THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE SHINE&#x2026;.</small> May he raise up children from you to be Torah scholars. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 6:23): <small>FOR THE COMMANDMENT</small> (<italic>mitzvah</italic>) <small>IS A LAMP, AND TORAH IS &#x003C;A LIGHT&#x003E;</small>. (Numb. 6:25:) <small>THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE SHINE</small> (from <italic>he&#x2019;ir</italic>) <small>&#x003C;UPON YOU&#x003E;</small>. May he raise up priests from you, who kindle fire (from <italic>he&#x2019;ir</italic>) upon the altar. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 1:10): <small>YOU WILL NOT</small><sup><xref rid="fn233">70</xref></sup> <small>KINDLE FIRE</small> (from <italic>he&#x2019;ir</italic>) <small>ON MY ALTAR IN VAIN</small>. (Numb. 6:25, cont.:) <small>AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU</small>. R. Hiyya the Great taught: May the Lord encamp with you.<sup><xref rid="fn234">71</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:25): <small>AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU</small>. May he raise up prophets from you. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 12:10): <small>AND I WILL POUR OUT UPON THE HOUSE</small> &#x007B;<small>OF JUDAH</small>&#x007D; [<small>OF DAVID AND UPON ANYONE DWELLING IN JERUSALEM</small>] <small>A SPIRIT OF GRACE AND MERCY</small>. Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:25): <small>AND BE GRACIOUS TO YOU</small>. May he set his grace upon you in whatever place you go. Thus it is stated (in Esth. 2:17): <small>AND SHE WON GRACE AND FAVOR</small>. (Numb. 6:26:) <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU &#x003C;AND GRANT YOU PEACE&#x003E;</small>. But another text says (of the Holy One in Deut. 10:17): <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small> (i.e., <small>SHOW FAVOR</small>). How can this be?<sup><xref rid="fn235">72</xref></sup> &#x003C;If&#x003E; one has repented before judgment is sealed, (Numb. 6:26:) <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE</small> (i.e., show favor). When judgment has been sealed, (Deut. 10:17:) <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small>. Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>. Along with the blessing there is a keeping.<sup><xref rid="fn236">73</xref></sup> A king of flesh and blood has a friend in Syria, but he dwells in Rome. When the king sent for him, he arose and came to him. He gave him a hundred pounds<sup><xref rid="fn237">74</xref></sup> of gold. &#x003C;When&#x003E; he loaded it up and set out on the road, bandits<sup><xref rid="fn238">75</xref></sup> fell upon him. They took everything that he had given him and everything &#x003C;else&#x003E; that he had with him. Do you suppose that he could have kept him from the bandits? For that reason it is stated (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn239">76</xref></sup> Another interpretation: May he <small>BLESS YOU</small> with money. <small>BLESS YOU</small> refers to sons (who can produce wealth), while <small>KEEP YOU</small> refers to daughters, since the females need keeping. And so it says (in Ps. 121:5): <small>THE LORD IS YOUR KEEPER; THE LORD IS YOUR SHADE ON YOUR RIGHT HAND</small>. [(Numb. 6:25:) <small>THE LORD MAKE HIS FACE SHINE UPON YOU</small>.] May he make the light of his face shine for you. Now <small>MAKE SHINE</small> (<italic>Y&#x2019;R</italic>) can only mean life, since it is written (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>. It also says (in Ps. 118:27): <small>THE LORD IS GOD AND HAS GIVEN LIGHT</small> (<italic>Y&#x2019;R</italic>) <small>TO US</small>. And similarly it says (in Ps. 67:2[1]): <small>MAY GOD BE GRACIOUS TO US AND BLESS US; MAY HE MAKE HIS FACE SHINE FOR US</small>. (Numb. 6:26:) <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE&#x2026;</small>. Does the Holy One lift up his face for a creature? Moreover, &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; caused to be written (in Deut. 10:17): <small>WHO DOES NOT LIFT UP HIS FACE</small> (i.e., <small>SHOW FAVOR</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn240">77</xref></sup> It is simply that, just as they lift us their faces to me, so do I lift up my face to them. How so? I have written in the Torah (in Deut. 8:10): <small>THEN YOU SHALL EAT, BE FULL, AND BLESS &#x003C;THE LORD YOUR GOD&#x003E;</small>. So when a person sits down with his children and the children of his house, and when there is not enough before them to be full, they &#x003C;still&#x003E; raise their faces to me as they give the blessing. Moreover, they exercise meticulous care for &#x003C;something as small&#x003E; as an olive, for &#x003C;something as small&#x003E; as an egg. Therefore (in Numb. 6:26): <small>THE LORD LIFT UP HIS FACE UNTO YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn241">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 6:23:) <small>THUS SHALL YOU BLESS</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>]. <small>SAY TO THEM</small>. &#x003C;<small>SAY</small> (<italic><small>AMOR</small></italic>) is written&#x003E; fully (i.e., with the O represented by the vowel letter, <italic>waw</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn242">79</xref></sup> <small>SAY TO THEM</small>, i.e., to the priests: &#x003C;It does&#x003E; not &#x003C;follow that&#x003E;, because I told you to bless Israel, that you will bless them &#x003C;as though&#x003E; in forced labor<sup><xref rid="fn243">80</xref></sup> and in sudden haste. Rather you shall bless them (fully) with religious devotion (<italic>kawwanah</italic>) of the heart, so that the blessing will be effective with them. It is therefore stated: <small>SAY TO THEM</small>.</p>
<title>2.19 Numbers 7:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many things preceded the act of creation?<sup><xref rid="fn244">81</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: Seven things preceded the world. These are the following: The throne of glory, the Torah, the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn245">82</xref></sup> the ancestors of the world, [Israel,] the name of Messiah, and repentance. And some would also say the Garden of Eden and Gehinnom. In the case of the throne of God, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 93:2): <small>YOUR THRONE IS ESTABLISHED FROM OF OLD; YOU ARE FROM EVERLASTING</small>. And in the case of the Torah, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Prov. 8:22): <small>THE LORD ACQUIRED ME</small> (i.e., wisdom) <small>AS THE BEGINNING OF HIS WAY THE FIRST OF HIS WORKS OF OLD</small>. In the case of the Temple, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Jer. 17:12): <small>O GLORIOUS THRONE, ON HIGH FROM THE BEGINNING, THE PLACE OF OUR SANCTUARY</small>. In the case of the ancestors of the world, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Hos. 9:10): <small>I FOUND</small> [<small>ISRAEL</small>] <small>LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT</small>; [<small>I SAW</small>] <small>YOUR ANCESTORS</small> [<small>LIKE THE FIRST FRUIT ON A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON</small>]. In the case of Israel, where is it shown? [Where it is stated of them] (in Ps. 74:2): <small>REMEMBER YOUR CONGREGATION WHICH YOU ACQUIRED OF OLD</small>. In the case of the name of the Messiah, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 72:17): <small>BEFORE THE SUN HIS NAME IS YENNON</small> (a symbolic name for the Messiah).<sup><xref rid="fn246">83</xref></sup> In the case of repentance, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Ps. 90:2): <small>BEFORE THE MOUNTAINS WERE BROUGHT FORTH</small>, since it is written (in vs. 3): <small>YOU RETURN HUMANITY TO CONTRITION</small>, [<small>AND SAY: REPENT YOU CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>]. In the case of the Garden of Eden, where is it shown? where it is stated (in Gen. 2:8): <small>AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN IN EDEN, FROM OF OLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn247">84</xref></sup> In the case of Gehinnom, where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Is. 30:33): <small>FOR TOPHETH HAS BEEN PREPARED FROM OF OLD</small>. Come and see. When the Holy One told Moses to tell Israel to make a tabernacle for him, the Holy One said to Moses: Say to those Israelites, as it were: It is not because I have nowhere to dwell that I am telling you to make me a tabernacle. Before the world was created, here was my sanctuary built in heaven above. It is so stated (in Jer. 17:12): <small>O GLORIOUS THRONE, ON HIGH FROM THE BEGINNING&#x2026;.</small> And a temple was built there for my throne, as stated (in Hab. 2:20): <small>BUT THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn248">85</xref></sup> So also has Isaiah said (in Is. 6:1): <small>I SAW THE LORD SEATED UPON A THRONE, HIGH AND LIFTED UP</small>. Out of love for you I left my temple on high, which had been prepared before the world was created, to come down and dwell among you. It is so stated (in Exod. 25:8): [<small>AND MAKE ME A SANCTUARY</small>] <small>THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said in the name of R. Johanan: This is one of the three commands which Moses heard from the mouth of the Almighty and which took him aback.<sup><xref rid="fn249">86</xref></sup> When he said to him (in Exod. 30:12): <small>EACH SHALL GIVE A RANSOM FOR HIS LIFE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn250">87</xref></sup> Moses said: Who can give a ransom for his life? It is written (in Job 2:4): <small>SKIN FOR SKIN</small>&#x0021; <small>ALL THAT ONE HAS HE WILL GIVE FOR HIS LIFE</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn251">88</xref></sup> and still it is not enough. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 49:8 [7]): <small>SURELY NO ONE WILL REDEEM A BROTHER NOR GIVE A RANSOM FOR HIM TO GOD</small>. The Holy One said to him: I am not asking &#x003C;a ransom&#x003E; in accordance with my means but in accordance with their means. (Exod. 30:13:) <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE &#x2026; &#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS</small>. [R. Meir said: The Holy One took something like a kind of coin of fire from under the throne of glory and showed it to Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn252">89</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;EVERYONE &#x2026; &#x003E; SHALL GIVE THIS</small>; &#x003C;i.e., <small>EVERYONE &#x2026; &#x003E; SHALL GIVE</small> one like <small>THIS</small>.] Again, when he said (in Numb. 28:2): <small>MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING</small>, Moses said: Who can supply enough offerings for you.<sup><xref rid="fn253">90</xref></sup> If we sacrificed all the beasts of the forest and all the trees of Lebanon, they would not be enough, as stated (in Is. 40:16): <small>FOR LEBANON IS NOT FUEL ENOUGH, NOR ITS BEASTS ENOUGH FOR SACRIFICE</small>. He said to him: I am not asking &#x003C;offerings&#x003E; in accordance with my means but in accordance with their means. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 28:3): <small>NOW YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM: THIS IS THE BURNT OFFERING WHICH YOU SHALL OFFER TO THE LORD: &#x003C;TWO YEARLING LAMBS WITHOUT BLEMISH&#x2026; &#x003E;</small> And not both of them at once, but (according to vs. 4): <small>THE ONE LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER IN THE MORNING AND THE SECOND LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER AT TWILIGHT</small>. And when he said to him (in Exod. 25:8): <small>AND MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &#x003C;THAT I MAY DWELL AMONG THEM&#x003E;</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn254">91</xref></sup> Moses said [to the Holy One] (in I Kings 8:27): <small>EVEN THE HEAVENS AND THE HEAVENS ABOVE THE HEAVENS CANNOT CONTAIN YOU</small>&#x0021; It also says (in Jer. 23:24): <small>DO I NOT FILL THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH? SAYS THE LORD</small>. And it says (in Is. 66:1): <small>THE HEAVENS ARE MY THRONE AND THE EARTH IS MY FOOTSTOOL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn255">92</xref></sup> So can we make him a sanctuary? The Holy One said to him: I am not asking &#x003C;a sanctuary&#x003E; [in accordance with my means] but in accordance with their means. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 26:1): <small>NOW AS FOR THE TABERNACLE, YOU SHALL MAKE IT WITH TEN CURTAINS</small>. When Israel heard this, they arose and donated gladly. So they made the Tabernacle. Moreover, when they had made the Tabernacle, it was filled with his glory, as stated (in Exod. 40:35): <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING, &#x003C;BECAUSE &#x2026; THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TABERNACLE&#x003E;</small>. The princes said: Now is the time for us to offer sacrifices with joy, because the Divine Presence is dwelling among us. Where is it shown? &#x007B;Where it is stated&#x007D; [From what they read on the matter] (in Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.</p>
<title>2.20 Numbers 7:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 27:18): <small>THE ONE WHO TENDS A FIG TREE SHALL EAT ITS FRUIT</small>. The Holy One does not deprive any creature of a reward.<sup><xref rid="fn256">93</xref></sup> It is simply that in the case of anyone who toils and devotes his life to something, the Holy One does not deprive him of his reward.<sup><xref rid="fn257">94</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (in Prov. 27:18): <small>THE ONE WHO TENDS A FIG TREE SHALL EAT ITS FRUIT</small>. Do you want to understand? Solomon built the Temple, as stated (in I Kings 6:14): <small>SO SOLOMON FINISHED BUILDING THE HOUSE</small>; but because David had devoted his life to the Temple which would be built, as stated (in Ps. 132:1&#x2013;5: <small>LORD REMEMBER DAVID AND ALL HIS HARDSHIPS, HOW HE SWORE TO THE LORD, VOWED TO THE MIGHTY ONE OF JACOB: SURELY I WILL NOT COME INTO THE SHELTER OF MY HOUSE, NOR WILL I GO UP UPON THE BED THAT IS SPREAD FOR ME</small>, [&#x2026; ] <small>UNTIL I FIND A PLACE FOR THE LORD</small>, the Holy One did not deprive him of his reward. Rather he had it written in his name, as stated (in Ps. 30:1 [introduction]): <small>A PSALM. A SONG OF THE DEDICATION OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID</small>. [It does not say, &#x201C;of Solomon,&#x201D; but, <small>OF DAVID</small>.] Solomon said it well (in Prov. 27:18): <small>THE ONE WHO TENDS A FIG TREE SHALL EAT ITS FRUIT</small>. So also you find in the case of the Tabernacle, when everyone devoted their lives &#x003C;to it&#x003E; and made the Tabernacle. All Israel volunteered. The women spun the goat&#x2019;s hair; and similarly (in Exod. 36:8): <small>THEN ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES &#x003C;AMONG THE WORKERS MADE THE TABERNACLE&#x003E;</small>. And likewise (according to Exod. 36:1): <small>THEN LET BEZALEL AND OHOLIAB &#x003C;AND ALL THE WISE-HEARTED ONES &#x2026; &#x003E; DO &#x003C;ALL THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C; However, they only did so&#x003E; because Moses devoted his life to &#x003C;the Tabernacle&#x003E;, so that it would be made just as the Holy One has shown him on the Mountain, as stated (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE THEM</small> &#x007B;<small>LIKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>BY MEANS OF</small>] <small>THEIR PATTERN&#x2026;</small>. Thus Moses went and devoted his life, so that they would not go astray. It is therefore written (in Exod. 39:1, 5, 7, 21, 26, 29, 31, cf. 42): <small>AS THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES</small>. And so it says (in vs. 43): <small>WHEN MOSES SAW ALL THE WORK, &#x003C;AND BEHOLD, THEY HAD DONE IT&#x003E; &#x2026;; THEN MOSES BLESSED THEM</small>. And with what blessing did he bless them? He said to them: May the Divine Presence dwell in the work of your hands. The Holy One said: Because Moses has devoted his life to the Tabernacle, I will only write about it in his name. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn258">95</xref></sup></p>

<p>[(Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.] This text is related (to (Numb. 24:5): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR TENTS, O JACOB, YOUR TABERNACLES O ISRAEL</small>. If <small>YOUR TENTS</small> &#x003C;is meant&#x003E;, why <small>YOUR TABERNACLES</small>? But if <small>YOUR TABERNACLES</small> &#x003C;is meant&#x003E;, why <small>YOUR TENTS</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn259">96</xref></sup> It is simply this: <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR TENTS</small>: These are the tents of your tabernacles (<italic>mishkenotekha</italic>).

You yourself know that this is so. When they sinned, what is written (in Ps. 78:59)? <small>GOD HEARD AND WAS ENRAGED</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 60)? <small>SO HE ABANDONED THE TABERNACLE OF SHILOH, THE TENT WHERE HE DWELT AMONG MORTALS</small>. This is the Tabernacle, which was only made so that it might be forfeited on account of Israel.</p>
<title>2.22 Numbers 7:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED SETTING UP THE TABERNACLE, HAD ANOINTED THEM</small> (<italic>sic</italic>), <small>&#x003C;AND SANCTIFIED IT&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> When he had anointed it, he returned and anointed its vessels. Then the princes of Israel offered sacrifices. They said: Now is the hour when we shall joyfully offer sacrifices, since the Divine Presence is dwelling among us.<sup><xref rid="fn261">98</xref></sup> Then when they saw that the Tabernacle had been made and that there was nothing at all [lacking] for them in it, they said: What is there for us to bring? They went and brought wagons on which they would carry the Tabernacle. But who gave them this suggestion? The tribe of Issachar, since they were wise and mighty in the Torah, as stated (in I Chron 12:33 [32]): <small>AND FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISSACHAR, THOSE WHO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES, &#x003C;TO KNOW WHAT ISRAEL SHOULD DO&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn262">99</xref></sup> For that reason they had the right to offer sacrifice (<italic><small>HQYB</small></italic>) on the second day, as stated (in Numb. 7:18): <small>ON THE SECOND DAY NETHANEL BEN ZUAR, PRINCE OF ISSACHAR, PRESENTED</small> (<italic><small>HQRYB</small></italic>, rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C;HIS&#x003E; OFFERING</small>. In &#x003C;the order of&#x003E; all the princes, why is his sacrifice mentioned &#x003C;on second day, immediately after Judah&#x003E;?<sup><xref rid="fn263">100</xref></sup> It is also mentioned here (in vs. 19): <small>HE PRESENTED</small> (<italic><small>HQRB</small></italic>; rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) <small>HIS OFFERING</small>. &#x003C;It is so mentioned&#x003E; because he offered (<italic><small>HQRYB</small></italic>; rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) it in accordance with the &#x003C;Divine&#x003E; command. When the rest of the tribes, who were greater than &#x003C;Issachar&#x003E;, wanted to sacrifice (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) [first], they decided &#x003C;the matter&#x003E; from heaven. So the tribe of Issachar was commanded to approach (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) with a sacrifice (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) for the altar and offer (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>) its sacrifice (rt.: <italic><small>QRB</small></italic>). You yourself know that it is so written (in vs. 19) where <small>PRESENTED</small> (<italic><small>HQRB</small></italic>) lacks a <italic><small>Y</small></italic> (i.e., a <italic>yod</italic>) &#x003C;and as such is really an imperative meaning &#x201C;bring near.&#x201D;&#x003E; When &#x003C;that tribe&#x003E; was far away, it was brought near to come (i.e., to offer sacrifice).<sup><xref rid="fn264">101</xref></sup> And why all this? Because they were knowledgeable in the Torah, as stated (in I Chron. 12:33 [32]): <small>AND FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISSACHAR, THOSE WHO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES, &#x003C;TO KNOW WHAT ISRAEL SHOULD DO&#x003E;</small>; [ &#x2026; ] <small>AND ALL THEIR KINFOLK WERE AT THEIR COMMAND</small> (<italic>&#x2018;al-pihem</italic>). &#x003C;This verse&#x003E; is for teaching you that they all affirmed the oral law (<italic>halakhah</italic>) <small>ON THEIR LIPS</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al-pihem</italic>).</p>
<title>2.23 Numbers 7:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT &#x003C;MOSES&#x003E; HAD FINISHED</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 51:20&#x2013;21 [18&#x2013;19]): <small>MAKE ZION PROSPER IN YOUR GOOD PLEASURE; &#x003C;REBUILD THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM&#x003E;</small>. [<small>THEN YOU SHALL DELIGHT IN SACRIFICES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, &#x003C;BURNT OFFERINGS, AND WHOLE OFFERINGS&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>.] &#x003C;You will do so&#x003E; because in this world they offered &#x003C;only&#x003E; a trifle.<sup><xref rid="fn265">102</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 7:12): <small>AND THE ONE WHO OFFERED HIS SACRIFICE ON THE FIRST DAY &#x003C;WAS NAHSHON BEN AMMINADAB OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH&#x003E;</small>. What did he offer as his sacrifice (According to Numb. 7:13&#x2013;17)? One silver bowl, one ladle, one bull, one ram, one lamb, one he-goat, and for the peace offering, two oxen. Here was all of the sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn266">103</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had set out on the road.<sup><xref rid="fn267">104</xref></sup> When they brought him a meal befitting the road and befitting the inn,<sup><xref rid="fn268">105</xref></sup> the king said to them: Are you honoring me like this? Are you treating me like this? Am I not a king? And am I not a temporal ruler? They said to him: Our Lord King, on the road we render according to the road and bring in &#x003C;food&#x003E; for you according to the inn. However, let us enter the capital city. Then when you enter your palace,<sup><xref rid="fn269">106</xref></sup> you shall see how we will honor you. Similarly when the Tabernacle was erected, the princes offered him a gift:<sup><xref rid="fn270">107</xref></sup> one ladle, one bull, one ram, one lamb, one he-goat. The Holy One said to them: Is that &#x003C;fitting for&#x003E; my glory? They said to him: Sovereign of the Universe, it is in the desert that we are giving you &#x003C;our gift&#x003E;,and the offerings before you are in keeping with the desert; however, when we enter your palace, you shall see how many bulls we offer you. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 51:20&#x2013;21 [18&#x2013;19]): <small>MAKE &#x003C;ZION&#x003E; PROSPER IN YOUR GOOD PLEASURE; &#x003C;REBUILD THE WALLS OF JERUSALEM&#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN WILL &#x003C;BULLS&#x003E; BE OFFERED UPON YOUR ALTAR</small>, and not &#x003C;merely&#x003E; one bull. So you find this &#x003C;to have happened the time of&#x003E; Solomon. [When he built] the Temple &#x003C;and&#x003E; wanted to offer sacrifice for the temple dedication, look at what is written there (in I Kings 8:63 // II Chron. 7:5)&#x0021; <small>SOLOMON SACRIFICED TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND OXEN AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND SHEEP AS PEACE OFFERINGS, WHICH HE SACRIFICED TO THE LORD</small>. And likewise in the days of Ezra, what is written there (in Ezra 6:17)? <small>THEY OFFERED AT THE DEDICATION OF THIS HOUSE OF GOD ONE HUNDRED BULLS, TWO HUNDRED RAMS, FOUR HUNDRED LAMBS&#x2026;.</small> Ergo (in Ps. 51:20 [18]): <small>MAKE ZION PROSPER IN YOUR GOOD PLEASURE&#x2026;.</small></p>
<title>2.24 Numbers 7:1ff., Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>. Rabbi &#x003C;Judah the Prince&#x003E; says: Every place where it is stated: <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS</small> (<italic>wayehi</italic>), [&#x003C;is referring to&#x003E; something new; but R.

When the Holy One created the world, he longed to have an abode below just as he had on high.<sup><xref rid="fn272">109</xref></sup> Having called Adam, he commanded and said to him (in Gen. 2:16&#x2013;17): <small>YOU MAY FREELY EAT OF ANY TREE IN THE GARDEN; BUT AS FOR THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL, YOU MAY NOT EAT OF IT</small>. Then he transgressed against his commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn273">110</xref></sup> The Holy One said this to him: This is what I longed for: Just as I have a dwelling on high, I would likewise have one below. Now when I have given you one command, you have not kept it. Immediately the Holy One removed his Divine Presence &#x003C;up&#x003E; to the firmament. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 3:8): <small>THEN THEY HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD GOD MOVING ABOUT IN THE GARDEN AT THE BREEZE TIME OF DAY</small>. [Now when they transgressed his commandment, he had &#x003C;only&#x003E; removed his Divine Presence to the first firmament.] &#x003C;When&#x003E; Cain arose and killed Abel, he immediately removed his Divine presence from the first firmament to the second firmament. &#x003C;When&#x003E; the generation of Enosh arose and became servers of idols, as stated (in Gen. 4:26): <small>THEN THERE WAS PROFANATION IN CALLING &#x003C;OTHER GODS&#x003E; BY THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>, he removed his presence from the second to the third &#x003C;firmament&#x003E;. The generation of the flood arose, and it is written of them (in Job 21:14): <small>YET THEY SAID TO GOD: LEAVE US ALONE</small>. Immediately he removed his Divine Presence from the third firmament to the fourth. When the generation of the dispersion &#x003C;of the nations&#x003E; arose, they said: He has no right to choose the upper regions for himself and give us the lower regions. What did they say (in Gen. 11:4)? <small>COME, LET US BUILD OURSELVES A CITY</small>. But what did the Holy One do to them (according to vs. 8)? <small>SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM OUT OF THERE</small>. He arose and removed his Divine Presence from the fourth firmament to the fifth. When the Sodomites arose, what is written of them (in Gen. 13:13)? <small>NOW THE PEOPLE OF SODOM WERE EVIL AND SINFUL</small> [<small>AGAINST THE LORD, EXCEEDINGLY SO</small>]. They were <small>EVIL</small> to each other, <small>SINFUL</small> in sexual matters, <small>AGAINST THE LORD</small> in idolatry, and <small>EXCEEDINGLY SO</small> in bloodshed.<sup><xref rid="fn274">111</xref></sup> Immediately the Holy One removed his Divine Presence from the fifth firmament to the sixth. The Philistines arose and provoked the Holy One; &#x003C;so&#x003E; he immediately removed his Divine Presence from the sixth firmament to the seventh. The Holy One said: I created seven firmaments, and up to now there are wicked ones &#x003C;still&#x003E; arising. What did the Holy One do? He folded away all the generations of the wicked and raised up our father Abraham. When our father Abraham arose and performed good works, the Holy One immediately descended from the seventh firmament to the sixth. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Isaac arose and stretched out his neck upon the altar, he descended from the sixth firmament to the fifth. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Jacob arose, he descended from the fifth to the fourth. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Levi arose, whose works were comely, he descended from the fourth to the third. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Kohath (the son of Levi and Grandfather of Moses) arose, he descended from the third &#x003C;firmament&#x003E; to the second. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Amram arose, he brought him down from the second to the first firmament. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Moses arose, he brought down the Divine Presence &#x003C;to earth&#x003E;. When? When the Tabernacle was set up. The Holy One said (in Cant. 5:1): <small>WHEN I COME TO MY GARDEN</small> for something for which I was longing. And this is (the context of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>. Hence R. Simeon ben Johay said: <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS</small> (<italic>wayehi</italic>) can only be something which existed, has ceased &#x003C;to exist&#x003E; for a long time, and has returned &#x003C;to be&#x003E; as it was.</p>

<p>[(Numb. 7:1:) <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>.] R.

The Holy One said to him: Moses, I am speaking peace; there is nothing in my heart against my children, as stated (ibid.): <small>FOR HE WILL SPEAK</small> [<small>PEACE UNTO HIS PEOPLE AND UNTO HIS SAINTS; SO LET THEM NOT TURN TO FOLLY</small>. It is also written after this (in vs. 10 [9]): <small>SURELY HIS SALVATION IS NEAR FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM, &#x003C;FOR HIS GLORY TO DWELL IN OUR LAND&#x003E;</small>. When?

R. Simeon b. Laqish said concerning it (the verse): What &#x003C;reason&#x003E; is there for me to learn &#x003C;this&#x003E; from the book of Psalms? It is a matter of &#x003C;record in&#x003E; Torah; for even in the place &#x003C;under consideration&#x003E; (i.e., in Numb. 7:1), there is nothing at all lacking (which is found in Ps. 85:9&#x2013;10 [8&#x2013;9]).

R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said (in Job 4:17): <small>SHALL A HUMAN BE MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN GOD</small>?&#x2026;. When Jacob went to Pharaoh, he did not depart from him until he had blessed him. And how did he bless him? He said to him &#x003C;that&#x003E; the Nile<sup><xref rid="fn277">114</xref></sup> would rise to his foot. Where is is shown?

<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:1): <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small>. R.

[From here] &#x003C;we learn&#x003E; that they were afraid. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOR OF THE ARROW THAT FLIES BY DAY</small>. Rabbi Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: There is a destructive demon (<italic>mazziq</italic>) that flies like a bird and shoots forth like an arrow.<sup><xref rid="fn284">121</xref></sup> (vs. 6:) <small>OF THE PESTILENCE THAT WALKS IN THE DARKNESS, OF THE PLAGUE THAT LAYS WASTE AT NOONDAY</small>. This is the plague demon, <italic>Meriri</italic>; for whoever sees him will not survive [in the world], whether he be human, cattle, or wild beast. How does it happen? His head resembles a calf with one horn coming out of the middle of his forehead, and he has dominion from the seventeenth of Tammuz (around July) to the ninth of Av (around August).<sup><xref rid="fn285">122</xref></sup> It is therefore written (in vs. 6 &#x0026; 10): <small>OF THE PLAGUE THAT LAYS WASTE AT NOONDAY&#x2026;. THERE SHALL NO EVIL COME UNTO YOU, NEITHER SHALL PESTILENCE COME NEAR YOUR TENT</small>. Ergo: until the day that the Tabernacle was erected, the destructive demons (<italic>mazziqin</italic>) were common.<sup><xref rid="fn286">123</xref></sup> On the day that the Tabernacle was erected they were annihilated (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>). &#x007B;R. Simeon b. Gamaliel&#x007D; [R. Simeon b. Laqish] said: What &#x003C;reason&#x003E; is there for me to learn &#x003C;this&#x003E; from the book of Psalms? It is &#x003C;to be&#x003E; learned from its &#x003C;proper&#x003E; place (in Numb. 6:24): <small>THE LORD BLESS YOU</small> &#x003C;to keep you&#x003E; from the destructive demons <small>AND KEEP YOU</small> from all evil.

<p>(Numb. 7:2:) <small>THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN OFFERING</small>. You find &#x003C;the following&#x003E;: when Moses proclaimed and said (in Exod. 35:5): <small>TAKE FROM AMONG YOU AN OFFERING &#x003C;FOR THE LORD&#x003E;</small>, what did the princes do?<sup><xref rid="fn289">126</xref></sup> They said: Moses did not know &#x003C;enough&#x003E; to tells us that the Tabernacle was being made. What did they do? They did not give a freewill offering. They said: These people are making the Tabernacle. Now he is telling us to give a freewill offering&#x0021; The Holy One said: By your life, you should know that I do not need you (princes). What is written there (in Exod. 36:3)? <small>AND THEY</small> (i.e., the children of Israel) [<small>STILL</small>] <small>BROUGHT FREEWILL OFFERINGS UNTO HIM IN THE MORNING, IN THE MORNING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn290">127</xref></sup> R.

He said to them: May the Divine Presence dwell in the work of your hands.

<title>2.30 Numbers 7:48ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 7:48:) <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>GILEAD IS MINE AND MANASSEH IS MINE; EPHRAIM ALSO IS MY CHIEF STRONGHOLD; JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER</small>. Resh Laqish said: If the heretics (<italic>minim</italic>) should say to you that the Holy One does not enliven the dead, say to them: See here, Elijah (of Gilead) [bears witness] that he has enlivened the dead [through his hand].<sup><xref rid="fn293">130</xref></sup> Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>GILEAD IS MINE</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND MANASSEH IS MINE</small>. If the heretics should say to you that the Holy One does not receive repentant sinners, say to them: See here, Manasseh bears witness that I received him through repentance, since it is stated (in II Chron. 33:13): <small>WHEN HE</small> (i.e., Manasseh) <small>PRAYED UNTO HIM, HE</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>GRANTED HIS REQUEST</small>, [<small>HEARD HIS ENTREATY</small>,] <small>AND RESTORED HIM TO JERUSALEM AND TO HIS KINGDOM</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>AND MANASSEH IS MINE</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>EPHRAIM ALSO IS MY CHIEF STRONGHOLD</small>. If the heretics say to you that the Holy One does not attend to (<italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) barren women, [say to them:] See here, Elkanah [of Mount Ephraim] bears witness that I attended to (<italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) his wife Hannah, as stated (in I Sam. 2:21): <small>FOR THE LORD VISITED</small> (<italic><small>PQD</small></italic>) <small>HANNAH; &#x003C;SO SHE CONCEIVED AND BORE THREE SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS&#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>EPHRAIM ALSO IS MY CHIEF STRONGHOLD</small> &#x2026;. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER</small>. If someone says to you that the Holy One does not rescue from the fire, see here, Hananiah and his friends bear witness that I rescued them from the fire, as stated (in Dan. 1:6): <small>NOW AMONG THOSE FROM THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH WERE</small> [<small>DANIEL, HANANIAH, MISHAEL, AND AZARIAH</small>]. Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER</small>.</p>
<title>2.31 Numbers 7:48ff., Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>GILEAD IS MINE</small>. Suppose someone says to you: Why did Elijah build an altar up on Mount Carmel and sacrifice on it, when the Temple existed at that time? For Moses has said (in Lev. 17:3&#x2013;4): <small>IF ANY SINGLE PERSON FROM THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL SLAUGHTERS AN OX, A LAMB &#x003C;OR A GOAT IN THE CAMP&#x003E; &#x2026;, AND DOES NOT BRING IT UNTO THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small> [<small>TO OFFER A SACRIFICE TO THE LORD BEFORE THE TABERNACLE OF THE LORD, BLOOD GUILT SHALL BE IMPUTED TO THAT PERSON</small> &#x2026;.: Say to him: What Elijah did, he did for the name of the Holy One and by divine command.<sup><xref rid="fn294">131</xref></sup> It is so stated (in I Kings 18:36): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS</small> (<small>ABOUT</small>) [<small>AT</small>] <small>THE TIME OF THE OFFERING OF THE OBLATION</small> (<italic>minhah</italic>), [<small>THE PROPHET ELIJAH DREW NEAR &#x003C;AND SAID&#x003E; &#x2026;, AND THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AT YOUR BIDDING</small>]. Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>GILEAD IS MINE</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND MANASSEH IS MINE</small>. Suppose someone says to you: See here, Gideon sacrificed in a high place, and it was forbidden because here was Shiloh in existence. Now R. Abba bar Kahana said: Gideon did seven &#x003C;unlawful&#x003E; things:<sup><xref rid="fn295">132</xref></sup> (1) He sacrificed a bull which had been worshipped, (2) a bull which had been set aside (for idolatry), (3) He built an altar, (4) he cut wood &#x003C;for it&#x003E; from the Asherah, (5) he sacrificed at night, (6) without a priest, and (7) he was among idol-serving priests; yet whatever he did, he did by divine command. It is so stated (in Jud. 6:25): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS DURING THAT NIGHT THAT THE LORD SAID TO HIM: TAKE THE BULL OX &#x003C;THAT BELONGS TO YOUR FATHER&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;.: Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): [<small>GILEAD</small>] <small>IS MINE</small>. [(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND</small>] <small>MANASSEH</small> [<small>IS MINE</small>]. (Ibid., cont.:) [<small>JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER</small>.] Suppose someone says to you: See here, David transgressed against &#x003C;something&#x003E; you should not do.<sup><xref rid="fn296">133</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Teach the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn297">134</xref></sup> like a scribe teaching children. It is so stated (in Ps. 51:15 [13]): <small>LET ME TEACH TRANSGRESSORS YOUR WAYS AND THE SINNERS SHALL RETURN UNTO YOU</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>JUDAH IS MY SCEPTER</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>EPHRAIM ALSO IS MY CHIEF STRONGHOLD</small>. If someone says to you: Why did Joshua profane the Sabbath in Jericho, say to him: He acted on divine command. It is so stated (in Joshua 6:2): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO JOSHUA: SEE, I HAVE GIVEN JERICHO INTO YOUR HAND</small>. It is also written (in vss. 3&#x2013;4): <small>SO YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY&#x2026;. THUS SHALL YOU DO FOR SIX DAYS WITH SEVEN PRIESTS&#x2026;. BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY SEVEN TIMES, AND THE PRIESTS SHALL BLOW ON THE SHOPHARS</small>. And how is it shown that it was on the Sabbath? In that there are never seven days without a Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn298">135</xref></sup> Now Joshua did yet another thing with &#x003C;divine&#x003E; concent, which is not told about him. When Jericho was conquered, it was Sabbath. He said: All of the Sabbath is holy, so whatever we conquer on the Sabbath will be holy to the Lord, as stated (in Josh. 6:19): <small>BUT ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD, AND</small> &#x007B;<small>ALL</small>&#x007D; [<small>VESSELS OF</small>] <small>BRONZE AND IRON, ARE HOLY TO THE LORD&#x2026;</small>. R. Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: He treated it like a city condemned (for idolatry), and in the case of a city condemned (for idolatry) it is forbidden &#x003C;to derive&#x003E; benefit &#x003C;from it&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 13:17 [16]): <small>AND YOU SHALL BURN WITH FIRE THE CITY</small> &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; [<small>WITH</small>] <small>ALL ITS PLUNDER AS A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said. &#x003C;Joshua&#x003E; taught Israel what the Holy One said to Israel (in Numb. 15:20): [<small>YOU SHALL SET ASIDE</small>] <small>THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH</small> [<small>AS <italic>A HALLAH</italic> OFFERING</small>.] Joshua said: In as much as we conquered it first, we shall make it a <italic>hallah</italic> to the Holy One. We shall dedicate all its booty to the Most High. The Holy One said: In as much as you have done so, see, your offering is supporting your tribe and overriding the Sabbath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 7:48): <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM</small> (who made the offering).</p>
<title>2.32 Numbers 7:48ff., Part III</title>
<p>[(Numb. 7:48:) <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM</small>. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi:] This text is related (to Eccl. 8:4&#x2013;5): <small>FOR A KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>WORD IS SUPREME&#x2026;. WHOEVER OBSERVES A COMMANDMENT SHALL NOT KNOW ANYTHING EVIL</small>. And so it says (in II Sam. 23:3&#x2013;4): <small>THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SPOKEN; THE ROCK OF ISRAEL HAS SAID TO ME: ONE WHO RULES OVER A PERSON, WHO RULES RIGHTEOUSLY</small> &#x007B;<small>IN</small>&#x007D; <small>THE FEAR OF GOD, &#x003C;IS LIKE THE LIGHT OF MORNING&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; Who is this? This is the one who rules over his &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive.<sup><xref rid="fn299">136</xref></sup> And who was this? this was Joseph, the father of &#x007B;Manasseh&#x007D; [Ephraim], the father of the father of Joshua ben Nun. What is written about him (in Gen. 39:7&#x2013;8)? <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS THAT HIS MASTER&#x2019;S WIFE CAST HER EYES UPON JOSEPH&#x2026;. BUT HE REFUSED&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One said to him: You did not heed her. By your life I am making you king over Egypt. Then they all shall obey you, as stated (in Gen. 41:55): <small>THEN PHARAOH SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO</small>] <small>ALL EGYPT: GO UNTO JOSEPH</small>. It also says (in vs. 40): <small>YOU SHALL BE OVER MY HOUSE</small>, and the children of my palace<sup><xref rid="fn300">137</xref></sup> shall do nothing without your consent. So it says (in Gen. 42:6): <small>NOW JOSEPH WAS THE GOVERNOR OVER THE LAND</small>. Because he governed his &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive, he became governor over the land. (Gen. 39:2:) <small>AND HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL MAN</small>. It was only necessary to say &#x201C;righteous man.&#x201D; Why did &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; write <small>SUCCESSFUL MAN</small>? The Holy One said to &#x003C;Joseph&#x003E;: You achieved what the first Adam did not achieve.<sup><xref rid="fn301">138</xref></sup> <small>SUCCESSFUL</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>LH</small></italic>) simply means achievement. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 19:18): <small>AND THEY CROSSED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>LH</small></italic>) <small>THE JORDAN AHEAD OF THE KING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn302">139</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: No sacrifice by an individual overrides the Sabbath; yet By your life, the sacrifice by your son (Ephraim) will override the Sabbath, because of the good work (<italic>mitswah</italic>) that you did (in resisting temptation). Ergo (in Numb. 7:48): <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM, ELISHAMA BEN AMMIHUD</small>. R. Azariah said: The Holy One said to him, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; to Joseph, you have kept commandment (<italic>mitswah</italic>) (from Exod. 20:13 &#x003D; Deut. 5:17:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</small>. So you have fulfilled the Torah before I gave it. No tribe shall come between your two sons. Instead (according to Numb. 7:48) Ephraim &#x003C;shall bring an offering&#x003E; on the seventh day; and (according to Numb. 7:54) Manasseh, on the eighth day.</p>
<title>2.33 Numbers 7:48ff., Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 7:48:) <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM, ELISHAMA BEN AMMIHUD</small>.] R. Meir and R. Joshua ben Qorhah were interpreting the names. Elishama &#x003C;means&#x003E;: &#x201C;He (Joseph) heeded (<italic>shama</italic>&#x2019;) my God (<italic>Eli</italic>),&#x201D; and he did not heed his mistress. <small>BEN AMMIHUD</small> means: He was &#x201C;with me (&#x2018;<italic>immi</italic>)&#x201D; but was not with her.<sup><xref rid="fn303">140</xref></sup> Similarly also in the case of (Numb. 7:54:) <small>GAMALIEL BEN PEDAHZUR &#x003C;PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF MANASSEH&#x003E;</small>, Joseph said: [Gamaliel] &#x003C;means&#x003E;: &#x201C;God (<italic>El</italic>) has recompensed (<italic>gamal</italic>)&#x201D; my people with a good recompense (<italic>gemulim</italic>). Ben Pedahzur (<italic><small>PDHT</small>s<small>WR</small></italic>) means: &#x201C;A rock (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></italic>) redeemed&#x201D; (<italic><small>PDH</small></italic>)&#x201D; him. And who brought it about for him (according to Ps. 18:21&#x2013;22 [20&#x2013;21])? <small>THE LORD REWARDED ME ACCORDING TO MY RIGHTEOUSNESS; ACCORDING TO</small> &#x007B;<small>MY PURITY</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE PURITY OF MY HANDS</small>] <small>&#x003C;HE RESTORED ME; FOR I HAVE OBSERVED THE WAYS OF THE LORD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. R. Samuel bar Abba said: What is the meaning of <small>ACCORDING TO</small> &#x007B;<small>MY PURITY</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE PURITY OF MY HANDS</small>]? According to the purity of my hands, because I was pure through good works.<sup><xref rid="fn304">141</xref></sup> (Ps. 18:21 [20]:) <small>THE LORD REWARDED ME</small>. How? When someone is poor, he trusts in the Holy One; but when he is wealthy, he trusts in his wealth and has no fear &#x003C;of the Divine&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn305">142</xref></sup> However, when Joseph was a slave, he feared the Lord. When his mistress enticed him with words, he said to her (in Gen. 39:9): <small>THEN HOW SHALL I DO THIS GREAT EVIL AND SIN AGAINST GOD</small>? Also when he became king he continued in fear &#x003C;of the Holy One&#x003E;, as stated (in Gen. 42:18): <small>FOR I FEAR GOD</small>. And when his brothers came down to him a second time (according to Gen. 43:16): <small>WHEN JOSEPH SAW &#x003C;BENJAMIN&#x003E; WITH THEM, &#x003C;HE SAID&#x003E; &#x2026; SLAUGHTER AND PREPARE</small> (<italic>wehakhen</italic>) <small>AN ANIMAL, FOR THE MEN WILL EAT WITH ME AT NOON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn306">143</xref></sup> Now surely it is not customary for kings to &#x007B;eat&#x007D; [prepare] &#x003C;food&#x003E; one day ahead for the next. R. Johanan said: It was the Sabbath, and he had merely prepared for the Sabbath day, as stated (in Exod. 16:5): <small>&#x003C;AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THE SIXTH DAY,&#x003E; THAT WHEN THEY PREPARE WHAT THEY BRING, &#x003C;IT WILL BE TWOFOLD&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn307">144</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: You have kept the Sabbath before it was given. By your life I will have the son of your son offer &#x003C;his sacrifice&#x003E; on the Sabbath day, as stated (in Numb. 7:48): <small>ON THE SEVENTH DAY IT WAS THE PRINCE OF THE CHILDREN OF EPHRAIM</small>.</p>
<title>2.34 Numbers 7:48ff., Part V</title>
<p>R. Abbin [Berabbi] the Levite said: As Joseph was offering his praise, his master saw him murmuring with his mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn308">145</xref></sup> He said to him: Joseph, what are you saying. Then he answered and said to him: I am offering praise to the Holy One. He said to him: I want to see your God. Joseph said to him: Consider Helios, &#x003C;who is merely&#x003E; one of his several attendants.<sup><xref rid="fn309">146</xref></sup> If you cannot look at &#x003C;his attendant&#x003E;, how much the less &#x003C;can you look at&#x003E; his own glory.<sup><xref rid="fn310">147</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Because of you I am appearing to him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 39:3): <small>WHEN HIS MASTER SAW THAT THE LORD WAS WITH HIM&#x2026;</small>. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: What is the meaning of &#x007B;(Ps. 24:8 or 10): <small>WHO IS THIS &#x003C;KING OF GLORY&#x003E;</small>?&#x007D; [(Ps. 24:9:) <small>AND THE KING OF GLORY SHALL COME IT</small>]? The one who shares some of his glory with those who fear him, i.e., the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn311">148</xref></sup> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one &#x003C;else&#x003E; uses his scepter, but the Holy One gave his scepter to Moses, as stated (in Exod. 4:20): <small>AND MOSES TOOK THE ROD OF GOD IN HIS HAND</small>. Moreover, no one &#x003C;else&#x003E; sits on his throne, [but the Holy One had Solomon sit on his throne], as written (in I Chron. 29:23): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD AS KING</small>. No one &#x003C;else&#x003E; rides on his horse, [but the Holy One had Elijah ride on his horse]. Now which horse belongs to the Holy One? Storm and whirlwind. Thus it is stated (in Nahum 1:33): <small>THE LORD IS IN THE WHIRLWIND, AND THE STORM IS HIS ROAD</small>. So it is written (in II Kings 2:11): <small>AND ELIJAH WENT UP IN A WHIRLWIND INTO THE HEAVENS</small>. Ergo: The Holy One shares his glory with those who fear him. He has also given his attire to the Messianic King, as stated (in Ps. 21:6 [5]): <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY YOU BESTOW UPON HIM</small>; for the attire of the Holy One is <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>, [as stated] (in Ps. 104:1): <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON</small> [<small>HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>]. What is written about the Holy One (in Jer. 51:56)? [<small>FOR THE LORD IS A GOD</small>] <small>OF RECOMPENSE</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn312">149</xref></sup> <small>HE SHALL REPAY IN FULL</small>,] for he repays the good according to their good &#x003C;deeds&#x003E; and the evil according to their evil &#x003C;deeds&#x003E;. What is written about Joseph (in Gen. 49:22)? <small>JOSEPH IS A FRUITFUL SON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn313">150</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: Joseph, there shall be peace upon the eye which closed and did not look at any of the Egyptian women.<sup><xref rid="fn314">151</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>DAUGHTERS</small><sup><xref rid="fn315">152</xref></sup> <small>STEP UPON THE WALL</small> (i.e., to gaze). R. Reuben said: what is the meaning of <small>UPON THE WALL</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>LY SH</small>wr</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn316">153</xref></sup> The Holy One said: It is for me (&#x2018;<italic><small>LY</small></italic>) to pay a reward (<italic><small>SKR</small></italic>) for that eye. Our Masters have taught (in <italic>Zev.</italic> 14:4, 5, 6, 7, 8) that they would eat in the sanctuary inside the hangings, but in Shiloh (which lay in Ephraimite territory) &#x003C;they would eat outside the sanctuary&#x003E; as far away as the eye could see.<sup><xref rid="fn317">154</xref></sup> Whatever Joseph did, the Holy One rewarded him. What is written (in Gen. 39:12)? <small>AND HE LEFT HIS CLOAK</small> &#x007B;<small>WITH HER</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN HER HAND</small>], <small>FLED, AND WENT OUTSIDE</small>]. The Holy One said ot him: [By your life,] when the children of Israel go out from Egypt, the sea is going to see your coffin and flee.<sup><xref rid="fn318">155</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Ps. 114:3): <small>THE SEA SAW &#x003C;IT&#x003E; AND FLED</small>. What did it see? [It saw] that Joseph had kept all of the Ten Commandments. Simeon, the man of Kitron, says: It saw the bones of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn319">156</xref></sup> And in addition, when Joseph&#x2019;s coffin (<italic>aron</italic>) proceeded before the ark (<italic>aron</italic>), the peoples of the world saw it and said: What is the nature of this ark which is proceeding along with the ark of the Torah? Then Israel answered them and said: This confirms what is written in this &#x003C;ark&#x003E;. And what was in the ark? The Ten Commandments. Now Joseph fulfilled all of them before they were given from Sinai. The Holy One said to Joseph: Joseph, although I have rewarded you with a little reward in this world, the main fund remains for you in the world to come, when Israel is redeemed with an everlasting redemption. Through the merit of Jacob and through your merit, they will be redeemed, a stated (in Ps. 77:16 [15]): <small>WITH YOUR MIGHTY ARM YOU REDEEMED YOUR PEOPLE, THE DESCENDANTS OF JACOB AND JOSEPH.

<ftnote id="fn164">1. Neither the Buber nor the traditional Tanhuma have a parashah, the beginning of which coincides with the beginning of <italic>Naso</italic> (Numb. 4:21-7:89) from the annual cycle. Such a parashah is also missing in other sources for the so-called &#x201C;triennial cycle.&#x201D; See B.Z.

<title>3.1 Numbers 8:1ff Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 8:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES SAYING: SPEAK UNTO AARON AND SAY UNTO HIM: WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. Let our master instruct us. Is it legal to light &#x003C;a Sabbath lamp&#x003E; with oil for burning<sup><xref rid="fn320">1</xref></sup> on a festival?<sup><xref rid="fn321">2</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab.</italic> 2:2): <small>ONE MAY NOT LIGHT &#x003C;A SABBATH LAMP&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn322">3</xref></sup> <small>WITH OIL FOR BURNING ON A FESTIVAL</small>. [<small>R. ISHMAEL SAYS: ONE MAY NOT LIGHT &#x003C;IT&#x003E; WITH TAR</small>] <small>OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE SABBATH. BUT THE SAGES PERMIT ALL KINDS OF OIL: SESAME OIL, NUT OIL, RADISH OIL</small>, [<small>FISH OIL</small>], <small>COLOCYNTH OIL, TAR, OR MINERAL OIL. R. TARFON SAYS: ONE MAY ONLY MAKE A LIGHT WITH OLIVE OIL ALONE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn323">4</xref></sup> R. Johanan ben Nuri rose to his feet and said: What will the people of Babylon do, who have nothing but sesame oil? What will the people of Media do, who have nothing but nut oil? [What will the people of Alexandria do, who have nothing but radish oil?] And what will the people of Cappadocia do, who have neither the one or the other but only mineral oil? R. Tarafon said to them: See we have found that the Holy One loves olive oil in a lamp more than all the other oils and more than all the gifts which are offered. You know that &#x003C;it is so&#x003E;: See, with reference to all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; gifts it is only said of them (as in Lev. 2:15): <small>AND YOU SHALL PUT OIL UPON IT</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn324">5</xref></sup> but with reference to the lighting of the lamp, it is written (in Exod. 27:20): <small>CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN&#x003E; OLIVES</small>. [Therefore R. Tarafon said: <small>ONE MAY ONLY MAKE A LIGHT WITH OLIVE OIL ALONE</small>.] We also find that in several places the Holy One warned about lighting the lamps <small>WITH CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C; BEATEN &#x003E; OLIVES</small> and so it says (in Exod. 27:20): <small>&#x003C;AND YOU SHALL COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E; TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN&#x003E; OLIVES</small>. So also it says (in Lev. 24:2, 4): [<small>&#x003C;COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E; TO BRING UNTO YOU CLEAR OIL OF &#x003C;BEATEN OLIVES&#x2026;.:</small>] <small>HE SHALL SET UP THE LAMPS UPON THE UNALLOYED LAMPSTAND</small>. And here also it warns about the lamps. Where? From what we have read about the matter (in Numb. 8:2): <small>&#x003C;SPEAK UNTO AARON AND SAY UNTO HIM:&#x003E; WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS&#x2026;.</small></p>
<title>3.2 Numbers 8:1ff Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): [<small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &#x003C;SERVANT&#x2019;S&#x003E; RIGHTEOUSNESS TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH</small>. The Holy One, as it were, said to Moses: Say to Israel: It was not because I need your light that I am telling you to light a lamp.<sup><xref rid="fn325">6</xref></sup> Rather &#x003C;I am doing so&#x003E; in order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment), and so it says (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &#x003C;SERVANT&#x2019;S&#x003E; RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. It is written about him, as it were, (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>; and similarly it says (in Ps. 139:12): <small>EVEN DARKNESS IS NOT DARK TO YOU</small>; [<small>FOR NIGHT SHINES AS THE</small> &#x007B;<small>LIGHT</small>&#x007D; [<small>DAY</small>], <small>AND DARKNESS BECOMES LIKE THE LIGHT</small>]. &#x003C;Scripture says these things&#x003E; to inform you that I do not need you. You yourself know &#x003C;this truth&#x003E;. Come and see. When a person builds a house and makes windows within [his house], he wants the light to enter. &#x003C;So&#x003E; he makes windows narrow on the outside and broad on the inside. Why? So that the light will enter from the outside and shine on the inside. But when Solomon built the Temple, he did not make the windows like that.<sup><xref rid="fn326">7</xref></sup> Rather they were narrow on the inside and broad on the outside so that the light would go out from the Temple and shine outside. It is so stated (in I Kings 6:4): <small>AND FOR THE HOUSE HE MADE WINDOWS BROAD AND NARROW</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn327">8</xref></sup> &#x003C;This text&#x003E; is to inform you that all light is his and that he has no need for some of your &#x003C;light&#x003E;. So why did I command you &#x003C;to set up the lamps&#x003E;? In order to have you acquire merit (by fulfilling a commandment). It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn328">9</xref></sup> Ergo (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS &#x003C;SERVANT&#x2019;S&#x003E; RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. And not only that, but if you are careful to light lamps for my sake, I will shine a great light for you in the world to come, as stated (in Is. 60:1, 3): <small>ARISE SHINE FOR YOUR LIGHT IS COME</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>AND NATIONS SHALL WALK BY YOUR LIGHT, EVEN KINGS BY THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR RISING</small>.</p>
<title>3.3 Numbers 8:1ff Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn329">10</xref></sup> You find that, when twelve tribes presented offerings at the dedication of the altar, the tribe of Levi did not offer anything, and they were depressed. &#x003C;They said:&#x003E; Why did he keep us from making an offering at the dedication of the altar? A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who made a banquet and each day invited various artisans. Now he had a certain friend who loved him exceedingly, but he did not invite him along with them. So he was depressed saying: Perhaps the king harbors &#x003C;some grievance&#x003E; against me in his heart. &#x003C;Perhaps&#x003E; it is for this reason that the king has not invited me to any of the feasts. When the days of the feast has passed &#x003C;the king&#x003E; called the friend &#x003C;and&#x003E; said to him: For all the people of the province I made &#x003C;that&#x003E; feast, but for you only I am making one single feast for yourself. Why? Because you are my friend. So it is with this king, the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. [You find that the twelve tribes brought offerings for the dedication of the altar] and the Holy One accepted them, as stated (in Numb. 7:5): <small>TAKE IT FROM THEM</small>. But the tribe of Levi did not bring an offering. When the dedication of the altar had passed, the Holy One said to Aaron and his sons: All the tribes have made a dedication. Now you make a dedication by yourselves. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON &#x003C;AND SAY UNTO HIM&#x003E; WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 6)? <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>.</p>
<title>3.4 Numbers 8:1ff Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 8:2, 4): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small> [&#x2026;. <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH</small>]. You find that Moses experienced more difficulty in making the menorah then for all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; vessels of the Tabernacle until the Holy One showed him with his finger.<sup><xref rid="fn330">11</xref></sup> It was the same concerning the hoofs of a clean animal, as it is stated (in Lev. 11:2, 4): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE CREATURES</small> [<small>THAT YOU MAY EAT&#x2026;. HOWEVER THESE YOU MAY NOT EAT</small>.] And it was the same concerning the &#x003C;new&#x003E; moon. The Holy One had said to him (in Exod. 12:2): <small>THIS MONTH</small>. So it was the same concerning the making of the menorah, where it is stated (in Numb. 8:4): <small>THIS IS THE MAKING OF THE MENORAH, HAMMERED WORK OF GOLD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HAMMERED WORK</small> (<italic><small>MQS</small>hh</italic>)? It is like saying: How difficult (<italic><small>MH QS</small>hh</italic>) it is to make; for Moses spent a lot of effort before the menorah was made, since it says so (in Exod. 25:31): <small>WITH DIFFICULTY</small> (<italic><small>MQS</small>hh</italic> revoweled as <italic>miqqashah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn331">12</xref></sup> <small>SHALL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. [&#x003C;The situation is&#x003E; like a person who says: How difficult (<italic><small>MHQS</small>hh</italic>) this task is for me&#x0021;] When it became difficult for him, the Holy One said to him: Moses, take a talent of gold and cast it into the fire. Then take it out, and it will have been made automatically. [Thus it is stated] (ibid. cont.): &#x007B;<small>ITS KNOBS, ITS BLOSSOMS, ITS CUPS, AND ITS SHAFTS</small>&#x007D; [<small>ITS BASE, ITS SHAFT, ITS CUPS, ITS KNOBS, AND ITS FLOWERS SHALL COME OUT OF IT</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn332">13</xref></sup> There was a blow with a hammer, and it was made automatically. It was therefore stated (in Exod. 25:31): <small>OF HAMMERED WORK</small> (i.e. with difficulty) <small>SHALL &#x003C;THE MENORAH&#x003E; BE MADE</small> (<italic><small>TY</small>&#x2018;<small>SH</small></italic>). &#x003C;The verb is spelled&#x003E; fully with a <italic><small>Y</small></italic> (<italic>yod</italic> in Hebrew) and not written &#x003C;with the normal spelling&#x003E; as <italic><small>T</small>&#x2018;<small>SH</small></italic> (which could be translated, &#x201C;you shall make&#x201D;). &#x003C;It is written with the extra letter&#x003E; so as to say: It <small>SHALL BE MADE</small> automatically. What did Moses do? He took a talent of gold and threw it into the fire. Then Moses said: Sovereign of the World here is the talent; [it is cast into the midst of the fire]. Let it be made (<italic><small>TY</small>&#x2018;<small>SH</small></italic>) for you just as you wish. Immediately the menorah came forth made as it should be. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:4 end): <small>ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH THE LORD HAD SHOWN MOSES, SO DID HE MAKE THE MENORAH</small>. &#x201C;Moses made&#x201D; is not written here, but merely <small>HE MADE</small>. So who did make it? The Holy One. Therefore, the Holy One told Moses to warn Aaron to [light &#x003C;the lamps&#x003E; as stated] (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS</small> &#x003E;. The Holy One said to Israel: If you light &#x003C;the lamps &#x003E; before me, I also will preserve your souls from everything evil, so that nothing touches you. Thus their souls are likened to a lamp as stated (in Prov. 20:27): <small>A PERSON</small>&#x2019;s <small>BREATH IS THE LAMP OF</small> &#x007B;<small>GOD</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE LORD SEARCHING ALL THE CHAMBERS OF THE BELLY</small>.</p>
<title>3.5 Numbers 8:1ff Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP; &#x003C;THE LORD MY GOD LIGHTS UP MY DARKNESS&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, are you saying that we should give light before you?<sup><xref rid="fn333">14</xref></sup> You are the light of the world and the light [dwells] with you, as it is written (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE REVEALS THE DEEP AND SECRET THINGS, HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>. Now you are saying (in Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>LET &#x003C;THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP</small>. The Holy One said to them: It is not because I have need of your light. Rather it is so that you may give light to me just as I have given light to you in order to exalt you in the presence of all the nations. Then they say: See how Israel is giving light to the one who gives light to everyone&#x0021; To what is the matter comparable? To a sighted person and a blind person who were walking on a road. The sighted person said to the blind person: Come and I will support you. So he supported him as he walked. When they entered the city and came into the house, the sighted person said to the blind person: Go out and light this lamp for me in order to give me light. The blind person said to him: When I was on the road you supported me until I entered the house, and you accompanied me. But now you are saying to me: Go out and light this lamp for me in order to give me light&#x0021; The sighted person said to him: &#x003C;It was&#x003E; so that you would not be under obligation to me for accompanying you on the road. I therefore said to you: Light &#x003C;this lamp&#x003E; for me. Now the sighted person is the Holy One, as stated (in Zech. 4:10 cf. II Chron. 16:9): <small>&#x003C;THESE SEVEN&#x003E; ARE THE EYES OF THE LORD. THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>. And the blind person is Israel, as stated (in Is. 59:10): <small>WE GROPE LIKE BLIND PEOPLE ALONG A WALL</small>. Moreover the Holy One was leading them and giving them light, as stated (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY &#x003C;IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> When the tabernacle was set up, the Holy One called to Moses and said to him: Tell them to give me light. It is so stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO</small> the children of Israel &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;: <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>, Israel said to the Holy One (in Ps. 18:29 [28]): <small>FOR YOU LIGHT UP MY LAMP</small>. Now you say that we are to give you light. The Holy one said to them: It was in order to exalt you that I told you to give light to me, just as I had given light to you. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>3.6 Numbers 8:1ff Part VI</title>
<p>[(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 7:1&#x2013;2)? <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE DAY THAT MOSES HAD FINISHED</small> [ &#x2026; ] <small>THAT THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL, &#x003C;THE HEADS OF THEIR ANCESTRAL HOUSES, NAMELY THE PRINCES OF THE TRIBES, THE ONES IN CHARGE OF THOSE BEING NUMBERED, &#x003E; MADE THEIR OFFERINGS</small>. Then afterwards (in Numb. 8:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON</small> [<small>AND SAY UNTO HIM</small>]: <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn334">15</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 34:10 [9]): <small>FEAR THE LORD, O YOU HIS HOLY ONES, FOR THOSE WHO FEAR HIM LACK NOTHING</small>. You find above (in Numb. 7) that eleven tribes made offerings. So while the tribe of Ephraim made offerings, the tribe of Levi made no offering. Moreover all the princes made offerings except for the prince of Levi. Now who was the prince of Levi? This was Aaron, as stated (in Numb. 17:18 [3]):<small>AND YOU SHALL WRITE THE NAME OF AARON UPON THE ROD OF LEVI</small>. So Aaron did not make an offering with the princes for he said: Woe to me&#x0021; Perhaps it is because of me that the Holy One is not accepting the tribe of Levi. The Holy One said to him: Go, say unto Aaron: Do not be afraid. You are ordained for something greater than this. It is therefore written (in Numb. 7:2): <small>SPEAK UNTO AARON&#x2026;</small>. The offerings remain in force as long as the Temple exists, but the lamps are forever. (According to Numb. 8:2 cont:) <small>LET &#x003C;THE SEVEN LAMPS&#x003E; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, and all the blessings which I have given you to bless my children shall never pass away.</p>
<title>3.7 Numbers 8:1ff Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, so that you will not despise this menorah. It is so stated (in Zech. 4:10): <small>FOR WHOEVER HAS DESPISED THE DAY OF SMALL THINGS SHALL REJOICE TO SEE THE PLUMMET IN THE HAND OF ZERUBBABEL, &#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; THESE SEVEN</small>. What are <small>&#x003C;THESE&#x003E; SEVEN</small>? These are the seven planets, in that (ibid. cont.:) <small>THEY ROAM AROUND ALL THE EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn335">16</xref></sup> (Numb. 8:2:) <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT</small>. These seven likewise are dear to him. Thus you may not despise them. It is therefore written (in Numb. 8:2:) <small>LET THE SEVEN LAMPS GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>, lest your &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive lead you astray into saying that he (i.e. the Holy One) has need of light. See what written about light, &#x003C;i.e.&#x003E; about the windows of the temple (in Ezek. 40:16, 25): <small>NOW THERE WERE NARROW WINDOWS INTO THE CELLS</small> [&#x2026;. <small>LIKE THE WINDOWS</small> (<italic>kehahallonot</italic>) <small>MENTIONED ABOVE</small>]. &#x201C;<italic>Behallonot</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn336">17</xref></sup> is not written here but &#x201C;<italic>kehahallonot</italic>&#x201D; (understood here as <italic>kehah halonot</italic> which means &#x201C;dim windows&#x201D;), in that they were wide on the outside and narrow on the inside in order to send forth light to the outside.<sup><xref rid="fn337">18</xref></sup> R. Berekhyah the Priest [Berabbi] said: This lightning is the result of fire from on high. When it goes forth it brightens up the whole world, as stated (in Ezek. 1:13): <small>AS FOR THE LIKENESS OF THE LIVING CREATURES</small>, [<small>THEIR APPEARANCE WAS LIKE COALS OF FIRE BURNING WITH THE APPEARANCE OF TORCHES &#x2026; AND FROM THE FIRE THERE WENT FORTH LIGHTNING</small>]. The Holy One said: I have no need of your light. [So why did I tell to you &#x003C;to give me light&#x003E;]? Simply in order to exalt you (<italic>ha&#x2019;alotekha</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn338">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Hanina said: Concerning your own eyes they have within them both black and white. Still you see not out of the white but out of the black. &#x007B;So would I&#x007D; [Now if in the case of your eyes, which have within them both black and white, but with you seeing only out of the black, would the Holy One who is all light] need light from anything of yours?</p>
<title>3.8 Numbers 8:1ff Part VIII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2 cont.): <small>IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. Flesh and blood lights a lamp from a burning lamp. Could one &#x003C;ever&#x003E; light a lamp from the darkness? The Holy One, however, did make a lamp give light from the darkness, as stated (in Gen. 1:2): <small>WITH DARKNESS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 3)? <small>THEN GOD SAID: LET THERE BE LIGHT</small>. Since I have brought light out of the darkness, do I have need for your light? So why did he say &#x003C;to light lamps&#x003E;? Simply for the sake of your exaltation (<italic>rt</italic>.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>), (in the words of Exod. 27:20) <small>TO SET UP</small> (<italic>rt</italic>.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) <small>AN EVERBURNING LAMP</small>.</p>
<title>3.9 Numbers 8:1ff Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 139:12): <small>EVEN DARKNESS IS NOT DARK TO YOU</small>; [<small>FOR NIGHT SHINES AS THE DAY, AND DARKNESS BECOMES LIKE THE LIGHT</small>]. But you are saying to us (in Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn339">20</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend. The king said to him: You should know that I am dining with you; so make ready for me. His friend went &#x003C;and&#x003E; prepared a commoner&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn340">21</xref></sup> coach, a commoner&#x2019;s lamp (<italic>menorah</italic>), &#x003C;and&#x003E; a commoner&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn341">22</xref></sup> table. When the king arrived, attendants came with him. They set around<sup><xref rid="fn342">23</xref></sup> menorahs of gold before him on either side. When his friend saw all the splendor, he felt ashamed and concealed everything that he had prepared, because everything was &#x003C;of the type used by&#x003E; commoners. The king said to him: What is this? Did I not tell you that I was dining with you? Why did you prepare nothing for me? His friend said to him: My Lord King when I saw all this splendor that came with you, I felt ashamed and concealed everything that I had prepared for you, because it consisted of commoner&#x2019;s utensils. The king said to him: By your life I am rejecting all my utensils which I have brought with me, and out of love for you I only wish to use yours. So it was with the Holy One. He is all light, as stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITHIN HIM</small>. When he says to Israel: Prepare a menorah and lamps for me, what is written there (in Exod. 25:8, 31)? <small>AND LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;, AND MAKE A MENORAH OF PURE GOLD</small>. When they had done so, the Divine presence arrived. What is written there (in Exod. 40:35)? <small>NOW MOSES COULD NOT ENTER THE TENT OF MEETING &#x2026;, &#x003C;BECAUSE THE GLORY OF THE LORD FILLED THE TABERNACLE&#x003E;</small>. Immediately he called to Moses, &#x007B;&#x003C;as stated (in Lev. 1:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; CALLED UNTO MOSES</small>.&#x007D; (Numb. 7:89:) <small>WHEN MOSES WENT INTO THE TENT OF MEETING TO SPEAK WITH HIM</small>. But what did he say unto him? (Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP &#x003C;THE LAMPS&#x003E;</small>. By your life out of regard for you I am rejecting everything &#x003C;of mine&#x003E; and using yours. (Numb. 8:2:) <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>.</p>
<title>3.10 Numbers 8:1ff Part X</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>WHEN YOU SET UP THE LAMPS</small>. Israel said (in Ps. 43:3): <small>SEND OUT YOUR LIGHT AND YOUR TRUTH; THEY WILL LEAD ME</small>. Great is the light of the Holy One&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn343">24</xref></sup> The sun and the moon give Light to the world, but from where do they derive their light? They snatch some sparks of celestial light. It is so stated (in Hab. 3:11): <small>&#x003C;SUN AND MOON REMAIN ON HIGH.&#x003E; THEY GO FOR THE LIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS, FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR SHINING SPEAR</small>. Great is the celestial light, of which only one part in a hundred has been given to mortals. It is so stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT</small><sup><xref rid="fn344">25</xref></sup> <small>IS IN THE DARKNESS, &#x003C;AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>. Therefore &#x003C;the Holy One says:&#x003E; I made Sun and Moon so that they would give you light, as stated (in Gen. 1:17): <small>GOD SET THEM IN THE FIRMAMENT OF THE HEAVENS TO GIVE LIGHT UPON THE EARTH</small>.</p>
<title>3.11 Numbers 8:1ff Part XI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:2): <small>&#x003C;LET THE SEVEN LAMPS&#x003E; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. &#x007B;David&#x007D; [Solomon] said (in Prov. 16:15): <small>IN THE LIGHT OF THE KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>FACE THERE IS LIFE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn345">26</xref></sup> R. Jacob bar Jose said: Joy was withheld from the wicked and given to Israel, because the Holy One was obliged to dwell among flesh and blood in the light. Thus he said to them (in Numb. 8:2): <small>&#x003C;LET THE SEVEN LAMPS&#x003E; GIVE THEIR LIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MENORAH</small>. R. Levi said: A pure menorah descended from the heavens.<sup><xref rid="fn346">27</xref></sup> Why? Because the Holy One said to Moses (in Exod. 25:31): <small>YOU SHALL ALSO MAKE A MENORAH OF PURE GOLD</small>. He said to him: How shall we make &#x003C;it&#x003E;? He said to him (ibid. cont.): <small>OF HAMMERED WORK SHALL THE MENORAH BE MADE</small>. Nevertheless Moses had difficulty; for when he descended he had forgotten its construction.<sup><xref rid="fn347">28</xref></sup> He went up and said: Sovereign of the World I have forgotten &#x003C;it&#x003E;. He said to him (in Exod. 25:40): <small>OBSERVE AND MAKE &#x003C;IT&#x003E;</small>. Thus he took a pattern of fire and showed him its construction,<sup><xref rid="fn348">29</xref></sup> but it was still difficult for Moses. The Holy One said to him: Go to Bezalel and he will make it. &#x003C;So&#x003E; Moses went down to talk to Bezalel, &#x003C;and&#x003E; he made it immediately. Moses began to be wonder and say: In my case, how many times did the Holy one show it to me; yet I had difficulty in making it. Now without seeing it you have made it from your own knowledge. Bezalel (<small>BT</small>s<small>L&#x2019;L</small>), were you perhaps standing in (<italic><small>B</small></italic>) the shadow (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>L</small></italic>) of God (&#x2019;<italic><small>L</small></italic>) when the Holy One showed it to me? Therefore when the temple was destroyed, the menorah was stored away. Now this was one of the five things that were stored away: The ark, the menorah, the fire, the Holy Spirit, and the cherubim.<sup><xref rid="fn349">30</xref></sup> When the Holy One in his mercy returns to build his house and his temple, he will restore them to their place and cause Jerusalem to rejoice. Thus it is stated (in Is. 35:1&#x2013;2): <small>THE DESERT AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD, &#x003C;AND THE WILDERNESS SHALL REJOICE AND BLOSSOM LIKE A CROCUS</small>.&#x003E; It also says (in vs. 2): <small>IT SHALL BLOSSOM ABUNDANTLY. IT SHALL ALSO BE GLAD AND GIVE PRAISE. THE GLORY OF LEBANON HAS BEEN GIVEN IT, THE SPLENDOR OF CARMEL AND SHARON. THEY SHALL BEHOLD THE GLORY OF THE LORD, THE SPLENDOR OF OUR GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn350">31</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.12 Numbers 8:5ff Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 8:5-6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES SAYING&#x003E;: TAKE THE LEVITES</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many strings were on the harp which the Levites played?<sup><xref rid="fn351">32</xref></sup> Thus did R. Judah teach:<sup><xref rid="fn352">33</xref></sup> There were seven (<italic>shB&#x2018;</italic>) strings on that harp, as stated (in Ps. 16:11): <small>IN YOUR PRESENCE THERE IS FULLNESS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SB</small></italic>&#x2018;)<sup><xref rid="fn353">34</xref></sup> <small>OF JOY</small>. Do not read &#x003C;the word pointed as&#x003E; <italic>sova</italic>&#x2018; (&#x201C;fullness&#x201D;) but &#x003C;as&#x003E; <italic>sheva</italic>&#x2018; (&#x201C;seven&#x201D;). So also did David say (in Ps. 119:164): <small>WITH SEVEN A DAY DO I PRAISE YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn354">35</xref></sup> Moreover, in the days of the Messiah it will be made with eight &#x003C;strings&#x003E;. Therefore David has stated concerning the instrumental music (in Ps. 6:1): <small>FOR THE LEADER; WITH INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC ON THE EIGHT-STRINGED HARP</small>. Furthermore in the age to come it will be made of ten &#x003C;strings&#x003E; as stated &#x007B;<small>SING TO GOD A NEW SONG&#x2026;</small>. &#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn355">36</xref></sup> [(in Ps. 144:9): <small>O GOD, LET ME SING TO YOU A NEW SONG; LET ME PLAY FOR YOU ON A TEN-STRINGED HARP</small>.] And who ordained them? Samuel and David. It is so stated (in I Chron. 9:22): <small>DAVID AND SAMUEL THE SEER ORDAINED THEM IN THEIR OFFICE OF TRUST</small>. Moreover, they &#x003C;were the ones who&#x003E; set up the divisions for singing. Now the Levites would stand on their platform and sing before the one who spoke for the world to come into being. See the love with which the Holy One loved the Levites. So from the beginning the Holy One chose them to serve him. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses. Levites are extremely dear to me. Take them in my name for a position of authority. &#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; [From where is it shown? From what they read on the matter] (in Numb. 8:6): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>.</p>
<title>3.13 Numbers 8:5ff Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:6): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. The Holy One does not elevate a person to an office until &#x003C;first&#x003E; he tests and examines him.<sup><xref rid="fn356">37</xref></sup> When he withstands his test, he elevates him to the office. And so you find in the case of our father Abraham, when the Holy One tested him with ten temptations, he withstood his trial. Then after that he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 24:1): <small>AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS</small>. So also in the case of Isaac, when he tested him in the days of Abimelech, he withstood the trial. Then after that he blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12): <small>SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND</small> [ &#x2026; <small>FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM</small>]. So also in the case of Jacob, when he tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau with Dinah, with Joseph, and &#x003C;with the tribulation of&#x003E; how he departed from the house of his father and his mother (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): <small>FOR WITH &#x003C;ONLY MY STAFF DID I CROSS &#x003C;THIS JORDAN&#x003E;</small> &#x2026;, he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small>, [<small>WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDAN-ARAM, AND BLESSED HIM</small>]. So also in the case of Joseph, he tested him with the wife of Potiphar, and he was imprisoned for twelve years. Then after that he came out and became king because he had withstood his trial. Ergo (in Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. So also in the case of the tribe of Levi, they laid down their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One (i.e. for martyrdom), so that the Torah would not be set aside. Now when Israel was in Egypt, they had rejected the Torah and circumcision and all of them had become worshipers of idols as Ezekiel has demonstrated where it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5): <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY UNTO THEM: THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD, IN THE DAY THAT I CHOSE ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>. Then what is written at the end (in vs. 8)? <small>BUT THEY REBELLED AGAINST ME AND DID NOT COME TO HEARKEN UNTO ME</small>. [<small>INDIVIDUALLY THEY DID NOT CAST AWAY THE ABOMINATIONS OF THEIR EYES NOR DID THEY FORSAKE THE IDOLS OF EGYPT</small>]. What did the Holy One do? He brought darkness upon Egypt for three days, and during those &#x003C;days&#x003E; he killed all the wicked ones of Israel. For this reason it says (in Ezek. 20:36, 38): <small>AS I BROUGHT YOUR ANCESTORS TO JUDGMENT IN THE DESERT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x2026;</small>.] <small>SO WILL I REMOVE FROM YOU &#x003C;THOSE WHO REBEL AND TRANSGRESS AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>. So also it says (in Cant. 2:13): <small>AND THE FIG TREE SHEDS</small><sup><xref rid="fn357">38</xref></sup> <small>ITS GREEN FIGS&#x2026;</small>. These are the wicked who are in Israel. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>AND THE VINES IN BLOSSOM GIVE OFF FRAGRANCE</small>. These are the rest who have repented and been accepted. (Ibid. cont.:) <small>ARISE, MY BELOVED, MY FAIR ONE, AND COME AWAY</small>, for behold the time of redemption has arrived. However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9): <small>FOR THEY OBSERVED YOUR WORD</small>, i.e., the Torah; <small>AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT</small>, i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there as stated (in Exod. 32:26): <small>SO MOSES STOOD UP ON THE GATE OF THE CAMP AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD COME TO ME. THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM</small>. When Moses said (in vs. 27): <small>EACH &#x003C;OF YOU&#x003E;</small> [<small>PUT HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH</small>, they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them, &#x003C;namely&#x003E; the one (according Deut. 33:9) <small>WHO SAYS OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER: I DO NOT CONSIDER THEM &#x2026;, FOR THEY</small> (the Levites) <small>OBSERVED YOUR WORD AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT</small>. When the Holy One saw that they all were righteous, that he had tested them and they had withstood their trial, as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8): <small>&#x003C;YOUR FAITHFUL ONE,&#x003E; WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH</small>, the Holy One immediately said (in Numb. 8:14): <small>AND THE LEVITES SHALL BELONG TO ME</small> to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5): <small>THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS</small>. In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.:) <small>BUT HIS SOUL</small> (i.e. the soul of the Holy One) <small>HATES THE WICKED AND THE LOVER OF INJUSTICE</small>. David said (in Ps. 128:1): <small>BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO FEARS THE LORD AND WALKS IN HIS WAYS</small>.</p>
<title>3.14 Numbers 10:1ff Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 10:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES SAYING&#x003E;: MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small> (<italic>hatsotserot</italic>). This text is related (to Ps. 24:7): <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>, [<small>BE LIFTED UP, YOU EVERLASTING DOORS</small>,] <small>&#x003C;THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN&#x003E;</small>. When Solomon was bringing the ark into the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn358">39</xref></sup> he began to say: <small>O GATES, LIFT UP YOUR HEADS</small>, because the openings were &#x003C;too&#x003E; low. [Then he said:] <small>BE LIFTED UP YOU EVERLASTING DOORS, THAT THE KING OF GLORY MAY COME IN</small>. The gates said to him (in vss. 8 and 10): <small>WHO IS THIS KING OF GLORY</small>? The gates immediately wanted to devour him &#x003C;and would have done so,&#x003E; if he had not said (in vs. 10): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY. SELAH</small>. Again he said (in vs. 8): <small>THE LORD STRONG AND MIGHTY</small>. He said to them: Expand yourselves, for the king of glory is coming upon you. They immediately paid him homage (<italic>kavod</italic>), raised up honor (<italic>kavod</italic>) for him, and raised themselves up.<sup><xref rid="fn359">40</xref></sup> So the ark entered. The Holy One said to them: You have paid me homage. When I destroy my house, no one will prevail against you. You know that all the implements of the Temple went into exile in Babylon as stated (in Dan. 1:2): <small>THEN THE LORD GAVE KING JEHOIAKIM OF JUDAH INTO HIS HAND</small>, [<small>WITH SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTS FROM THE HOUSE OF THE GOD; AND HE BROUGHT THEM TO THE LAND OF SHINAR</small>]. But the temple gates were hidden in situ, as stated (in Lam. 2:9): <small>HER GATES HAVE SUNK INTO THE GROUND</small>.</p>
<title>3.15 Numbers 10:1ff Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation:] What is the meaning (of Ps. 24:10): <small>THE LORD OF HOSTS, HE IS THE KING OF GLORY</small>? That he imparts some of his glory to those who fear him as befits his glory.<sup><xref rid="fn360">41</xref></sup> How? He is called &#x201C;god&#x201D; (<italic>elohim</italic>), and he called Moses &#x201C;god,&#x201D; as stated (in Exod. 7:1): <small>SEE I HAVE SET YOU AS A GOD TO PHARAOH</small>. He (the Holy One) causes the dead to live, and he imparted some of his glory to Elijah. Thus he (i.e., Elijah) caused the dead to live, as stated (in I Kings 17:23): <small>AND ELIJAH SAID: SEE YOUR SON IS ALIVE</small>. Because the Holy One imparts some of his glory to those who fear him, he put his own clothing on the Messianic King, as stated (in Ps. 21:6 [5]): <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY YOU SHALL LAY UPON HIM</small>. Our masters have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn361">42</xref></sup> In the case of a king of flesh and blood, no one rides upon his horse, no one puts on his clothes, no one uses his crown, and no one sits upon his throne; but in all these &#x003C;instances&#x003E; the Holy One shared &#x003C;his glory&#x003E; with those who feared him and gave to them.<sup><xref rid="fn362">43</xref></sup> Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Nahum 1:3): <small>THE LORD IS IN THE WHIRLWIND, AND THE STORM IS HIS ROAD</small>. But he gave it (i.e., the divine whirlwind horse) to Elijah, as stated (in II Kings. 2:11): <small>AND</small> [<small>ELIJAH</small>] <small>WENT UP IN A WHIRLWIND INTO THE HEAVENS</small>. No one puts on his clothes. What is written (in Ps. 104:1)? &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>YOU HAVE PUT ON HONOR AND MAJESTY</small>. Also with reference to the Messianic King, it is written (in Ps. 21:6 [5]): <small>HONOR AND MAJESTY YOU BESTOWED UPON HIM</small>. No one uses his crown. What is written concerning Moses (in Exod. 34:29)? <small>AND MOSES DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SKIN OF HIS FACE WAS SHINING</small>. And no one sits upon his throne. Now it is written (in I Chron. 29:23): <small>THEN SOLOMON SAT UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD AS KING</small>. (<italic>Sanh.</italic> 2:5:) <small>AND NO ONE USES HIS SCEPTER</small>. But he gave it to Moses as stated (in Exod. 4:17): <small>YOU SHALL TAKE IN YOUR HAND THIS ROD &#x003C;WITH WHICH YOU SHALL PERFORM THE SIGNS&#x003E;</small>. What is written about the Holy One (in Ps. 47:6 [5])? <small>GOD HAS ASCENDED AMID ACCLAMATION; THE LORD WITH THE SOUND OF A TRUMPET</small> (<italic>shofar</italic>). The Holy One said to Moses: I have made you a king. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:5): <small>THEN HE BECAME KING IN JESHURUN</small>. Just as when the king goes forth, they sound trumpets before him, so also will they sound trumpets before you when you go forth. (Numb. 10:2:) <small>MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small> (<italic>hatsotserot</italic>).</p>
<title>3.16 Numbers 10:1ff Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation [(of Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small>]. This text is related (to Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD, AND THE KING</small>. R. Isaac bar Eleazar of Caesarea said: What wisdom made was a crown for her head.<sup><xref rid="fn363">44</xref></sup> Her humility made &#x007B;slippers&#x007D; a slipper]<sup><xref rid="fn364">45</xref></sup> for her foot.<sup><xref rid="fn365">46</xref></sup> It is written elsewhere (in Ps. 111:10): <small>THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM IS THE FEAR OF THE LORD</small> and it is written (in Prov. 22:4): <small>THE HEEL</small><sup><xref rid="fn366">47</xref></sup> <small>OF HUMILITY IS THE FEAR OF THE LORD</small>. Solomon therefore said (in Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD, AND THE KING</small>. But what is the meaning of <small>AND THE KING</small>? Simply &#x003C;this&#x003E;: Make him (i.e., the Holy One) king over you.<sup><xref rid="fn367">48</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21): <small>AND THE KING</small>. Be king over the evil drive, which is called a king where it is stated (in Eccl. 9:14): <small>&#x003C;THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT,&#x003E; AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn368">49</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21): <small>AND THE KING</small>. &#x201C;&#x003C;More&#x003E; than the king,&#x201D; lest it be supposed that, if the king says to you: Worship an idol you should heed him.<sup><xref rid="fn369">50</xref></sup> The text reads (in Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD</small>. Thus &#x003C;when&#x003E; Nebuchadnezzar told Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah to worship an idol, they did not heed him. Instead they said to him (in Dan. 3:18): <small>WE WILL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS, NOR WILL WE PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP</small>. (Dan. 3:14:) <small>IS IT TRUE, SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO</small>? [Yesterday you were actually<sup><xref rid="fn370">51</xref></sup> saying: Whoever wanted to take an idol for himself came to Jerusalem, as stated (in Is. 10:10): <small>AND THEIR GRAVEN IMAGES WERE FROM JERUSALEM AND FROM SAMARIA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn371">52</xref></sup> But now you have come to destroy my idol worship. (Dan. 3:14:) <small>IS IT TRUE, SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO</small>? Did not the Holy One say this to you that you should obey royalty in whatever it tells you, where it is stated (in Eccl. 8:2): I <small>&#x003C;SAY&#x003E;: KEEP THE KING&#x2019;S COMMAND</small>? They said to him: You are king over us for taxes and crop levies;<sup><xref rid="fn372">53</xref></sup> but in regard to the service of idols, Nebuchadnezzar and a dog &#x003C;have&#x003E; equal &#x003C;authority&#x003E;. (Dan. 3:16&#x2013;17:) <small>SHADRACH, MESHACH, AND ABEDNEGO ANSWERED</small> [<small>AND SAID TO THE KING: O NEBUCHADNEZZAR</small>], <small>WE DO NOT</small> &#x007B;<small>CARE</small>&#x007D; [<small>NEED</small>] <small>&#x003C;TO ANSWER YOU&#x003E; IN THIS &#x003C;MATTER&#x003E;. IF OUR GOD &#x003C;WHOM WE SERVE IS ABLE TO SAVE US, HE SHALL SAVE US FROM THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE AND FROM YOUR HAND O KING&#x003E;</small>. They said: Whether he delivers us or whether he does not deliver us (in vs. 18): <small>BE IT KNOWN TO YOU, &#x003C;O KING, THAT WE WILL NOT SERVE YOUR GODS NOR PAY HOMAGE TO THE IMAGE OF GOLD WHICH YOU HAVE SET UP&#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD, AND THE KING; AND DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THOSE WHO WOULD DIFFER</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; <small>DO NOT ASSOCIATE WITH</small> those who say that there are two gods in the world, for the end of &#x003C;such people&#x003E; is to perish from the world. It is so stated (in Zech. 13:8): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS</small> [<small>IN IT</small>] <small>SHALL BE CUT OFF</small> [<small>AND DIE</small>], <small>BUT ONE-THIRD SHALL REMAIN IN IT</small>. And who is the one-third? This is Israel as stated (in Is. 19:24): <small>AND ISRAEL SHALL BE A THIRD &#x003C;PARTNER WITH EGYPT AND ASSYRIA, A BLESSING IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTH&#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD MY CHILD AND THE KING</small>.</p>
<title>3.17 Numbers 10:1ff Part IV</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Prov. 24:21): <small>FEAR THE LORD, MY CHILD, AND THE KING</small>.] Whoever is in fear of the Holy One becomes a king. From whom did you learn &#x003C;that&#x003E;? From Abraham because he was in fear of the Holy One and became a king. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:12): <small>FOR NOW I KNOW THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>. But where is it shown that he became a king? [R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said in the name of R. Helbo:] It is written (in Gen. 14:17): <small>&#x003C;AND THE KING OF SODOM CAME OUT TO MEET HIM &#x2026; &#x003E; AT THE VALLEY OF SHAVEH</small>, i.e., <small>THE VALLEY OF THE KING</small>. [What is the meaning of <small>THE VALLEY OF SHAVEH</small> (rt.: <italic>Sh<small>WH</small></italic>?] That they all became equal (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>WH</small></italic>). So taking counsel (or taking wood),<sup><xref rid="fn373">54</xref></sup> they cut cedars, made a throne, and set him over them as king. And you should not say &#x003C;this&#x003E; only &#x003C;in the case of&#x003E; Abraham alone. In the case of Moses &#x003C;as well&#x003E;, because he was in fear of the Holy One, he became a king. [Now where is it stated that he feared &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E;? Where it is stated (in Exod. 3:6): <small>THEN MOSES HID HIS FACE, FOR HE WAS AFRAID TO LOOK AT GOD</small>. And where is it shown that he became a king?] Where it is stated (in Deut. 33:5): <small>THEN HE BECAME KING IN JESHURUN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn374">55</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Moses: I have made you a king. As they blow trumpets before a king when he goes forth to war, so shall they blow trumpets before you when you go forth to war. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE TWO SILVER TRUMPETS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn375">56</xref></sup></p>
<title>3.18 Numbers 10:1ff Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2 translated literally): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small> (<italic>lekha</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; at your own expense (literally: from what belongs to you [<italic>lekha</italic>]).<sup><xref rid="fn376">57</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF. FOR YOURSELF</small> you shall make &#x003C;them&#x003E; and not for others. You are to use them, and no one else is to use them. You yourself know that, in the case of his disciple Joshua, he did not use those &#x003C;trumpets&#x003E; but horns. When they came to fight against Jericho, there gathered in Jericho seven peoples. It is so stated (in Josh. 14:11): <small>WHEN YOU CROSSED THE JORDAN AND CAME UNTO JERICHO, THE CITIZENS OF JERICHO: THE AMORITES, THE PERIZZITES</small>, [<small>THE CANAANITES, THE HITTITES, THE GIRGASHITES</small>,] <small>THE HIVITES, AND THE JEBUSITES FOUGHT AGAINST YOU</small>. Did seven peoples make up the citizens of Jericho? After all it says &#x003C;here&#x003E;: <small>THE CITIZENS OF JERICHO: THE AMORITES&#x2026;</small>. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: Jericho was the door bolt &#x003C;for unlocking&#x003E; the land of Israel. They said: If Jericho is conquered, the whole land will be conquered. For that reason seven peoples gathered within it. What is written (in Josh. 6:20)? <small>SO THE PEOPLE SHOUTED WHEN &#x003C;THE PRIESTS&#x003E; BLEW ON THE HORNS</small>. &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that even though Joshua was &#x003C;Moses&#x2019;&#x003E; disciple, he did not use them (i.e. the silver trumpets). Moreover you should not say &#x003C;this only&#x003E; about Joshua but even &#x003C;about&#x003E; our master Moses, &#x003C;since the trumpets&#x003E; were hidden while he was &#x003C;still&#x003E; alive. R. Isaac said: Note that when Moses was going to depart this world, he said (in Deut. 31:28): <small>GATHER UNTO ME</small> [<small>ALL THE ELDERS OF YOUR TRIBES AND YOUR OFFICIALS</small>]. But where were the trumpets? After all he did not say: Blow on them for &#x003C;those people&#x003E; to gather. It is simply that while he was alive they were hidden. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: &#x003C;It was to fulfill what was said (in Eccl. 8:8): <small>&#x003C;NO HUMAN HAS CONTROL OVER THE WIND, TO CONTAIN THE WIND &#x003E; NOR IS THERE CONTROL ON THE DAY OF DEATH</small>&#x2026; Ergo (in Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small>, and no one else is to use them all your days.</p>
<title>3.19 Numbers 10:1ff Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 10:2): <small>MAKE FOR YOURSELF</small>. You are to use them because you are a king, but another is not to use them except King David, as stated (in II Chron. 29:26, 28): <small>AND THE LEVITES STOOD</small> &#x007B;<small>IN THEIR PLACE</small>&#x007D; [&#x2026;.: <small>THE SONG WAS SUNG AND THEY BLEW THE TRUMPETS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn377">58</xref></sup> Our masters have said: The trumpets that were in the Sanctuary were also hidden, but King David used the harp, as stated (in Ps. 57:9 [8]): <small>AWAKE, MY GLORY; AWAKE, O LYRE AND HARP</small>. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: A harp was hanging above David&#x2019;s headrest.<sup><xref rid="fn378">59</xref></sup> When midnight arrived, a north wind would blow strongly on it, and it would play of its own accord. Immediately David and the students would arise to occupy themselves with the Torah; and driving sleep from their eyes, they would meditate on the Torah until the dawn arose. Therefore, David said (ibid.): <small>AWAKE, MY GLORY</small>. It is customary for the dawn to awaken the children of Adam, but (ibid. cont.:) <small>I WILL AWAKEN THE DAWN</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 57:9 [8]): <small>AWAKE MY, GLORY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AWAKE</small> (&#x2018;<italic>urah</italic>), <small>MY GLORY</small> (words which can also be rendered: <small>EMPTY WAS</small> [&#x2018;<italic>urah</italic>] <small>MY GLORY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn379">60</xref></sup> &#x003C;What is the meaning of <small>AWAKE</small> (or <small>EMPTY WAS</small>) <small>MY GLORY? MY GLORY</small> is&#x003E; due to the glory of my creator. For the &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive would say to him: David, are you not a king? It is customary for kings to arise at three hours [into the day]; so why are you arising at midnight? Then he said to him: <small>EMPTY WAS MY GLORY. MY GLORY</small> is nothing before the glory of my creator. It is therefore stated: <small>AWAKE</small> (or <small>EMPTY WAS</small>) <small>MY GLORY</small>. So he would arise at midnight and praise the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 119:62): <small>AT MIDNIGHT I WILL ARISE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR RIGHTEOUS STATUTES</small>. David said: It is my duty to arise at midnight and to praise you for the wonders that you have done with my ancestor (Ruth) at midnight, as stated (in Ruth 3:8&#x2013;9): <small>NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT MIDNIGHT THAT THE MAN WAS STARTLED. SO HE TURNED ASIDE, &#x003C;AND HERE WAS A WOMAN LYING AT HIS FEET&#x003E;. THEN HE SAID: WHO ARE YOU? AND SHE SAID: I AM YOUR HANDMAID RUTH</small>. So he said to her (in vs. 13): <small>SPEND THE NIGHT</small>. [<small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT</small>,] <small>IF HE WILL REDEEM YOU GOOD&#x2026;</small>. R. Judah bar Shallum [the Levite] said: She said to him: Are you sending me away with &#x003C;mere&#x003E; words? He said to her (ibid. cont.): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small> I am not sending you away with &#x003C;mere&#x003E; words. [Another interpretation] (of Ruth 3:13): <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small>. &#x003C;This oath&#x003E; teaches that he had imposed an oath on his &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive, which was inciting him by saying to him: You are an unmarried man and she is an unmarried woman. Now is the time to seduce her. Immediately this righteous man swore: <small>AS THE LORD LIVES</small> I am not touching her tonight. And not only Boaz, but all the righteous impose an oath on their &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive. Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? <small>AND DAVID SAID: AS THE LORD LIVES</small>, [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>SHALL SMITE HIM. EITHER HE WILL DIE WHEN HIS DAY COMES &#x003C;OR HE WILL GO DOWN AND PERISH IN BATTLE. THE LORD FORBID THAT I LAY MY HAND ON THE LORD&#x2019;S ANOINTED&#x003E;</small>. Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said: His &#x003C;evil&#x003E; drive came and said to him: If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. Moreover according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him, since here he is pursuing &#x003C;you&#x003E;. He therefore hastened to swear two times: As he lives I will not kill him. Israel said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, you know the power of the evil drive, how strong it is. The Holy One said to them: Remove<sup><xref rid="fn380">61</xref></sup> it little by little, and I will take it away. Thus it is stated (in Is. 62:10): <small>BUILD UP, COMPLETE THE HIGHWAY</small><sup><xref rid="fn381">62</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;TAKE AWAY SOME STONE&#x003E;</small> (i.e. the evil drive)&#x0021; It also says (in Is. 57:14): <small>BUILD UP, BUILD UP</small>&#x0021; <small>CLEAR OUT A WAY</small>&#x0021; <small>&#x003C;REMOVE AN OBSTACLE</small> (i.e. the evil drive) <small>FROM THE WAY OF MY PEOPLE</small>&#x0021; &#x003E; Then in the world to come I will root it out of you, as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH</small>. Thus has R. Tanhuma bar Abba interpreted.</p>
<title>3.20 Numbers 11:16ff Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x2026;.</small> Let our master instruct us: Within how many cubits is one obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder when he sees him?<sup><xref rid="fn382">63</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: Within four cubits one is obligated to stand up in the presence of an elder.<sup><xref rid="fn383">64</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF</small><sup><xref rid="fn384">65</xref></sup> <small>A GRAY HEAD</small>. One also bows down before him and asks after his welfare, &#x003C;when&#x003E; within four cubits. And about which honor did Torah say (ibid. cont.): <small>YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER</small>? That one should not stand in his place, sit in his place, or contradict his words. Also when one asks &#x003C;about&#x003E; a law (<italic>halakhah</italic>), one should ask with reverence and not rush to respond or interrupt his words. Whoever does not behave toward his teacher (<italic>rav</italic>) according to all these rules is labeled a wicked person before the Omnipresent, his learning is forgotten, his years are shortened, and in the end he comes into the hands of &#x007B;transgressions&#x007D; [poverty], as stated (in Eccl. 8:13): <small>IT SHALL NOT GO WELL WITH THE WICKED ONE, NOR SHALL HE PROLONG HIS DAYS. &#x003C;THEY ARE&#x003E; LIKE A SHADOW, BECAUSE HE IS NOT IN FEAR BEFORE GOD</small>. In regard to this fear I do not know &#x003C;exactly&#x003E; what it is; &#x003C;but&#x003E; when it says (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GRAY HEAD, &#x003C;YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER, &#x003E; AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>, note that it is &#x003C;really&#x003E; saying: This is the fear of students toward sages.<sup><xref rid="fn385">66</xref></sup> But I might say: This is a fear of usury and a fear of &#x003C;false&#x003E; weights.<sup><xref rid="fn386">67</xref></sup> It is simply that R. Eleazar has said: It is stated here: <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL HONOR&#x003E; THE PRESENCE</small> (<italic><small>PNY</small></italic>) <small>OF THE ELDER, AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>; while it is stated in the other passage (in Eccl. 8:13): <small>HE IS NOT IN FEAR BEFORE</small> (<italic><small>PNY</small></italic>) <small>GOD</small>. Moreover, one is obligated to &#x003C;have him&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn387">68</xref></sup> precede everyone when entering and leaving and to treat him with fear and honor. It is so stated (in Deut. 6:13):<small>YOU SHALL FEAR</small> (<italic>et</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn388">69</xref></sup> <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. &#x003C;The <italic>et</italic> must refer&#x003E; to the master scholars of Torah since you have no other guide like it. And so it says (in Deut. 1:15): <small>&#x003C;SO I TOOK THE HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES, WISE AND WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE, &#x003E; AND APPOINTED THEM HEADS OVER</small> &#x007B;<small>THE PEOPLE</small>&#x007D; [<small>YOU</small>]. From here you learn that you should treat him in a princely manner, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; stand in his presence, and give him precedence in every matter of dignity. So let no one on his own refrain from standing in the presence of an elder. R. Abba bar Pappa the Priest said: When I saw a certain group of people, I would walk by another route so as not to be a bother for them, lest they see me and stand for me. When I told of the matter to R. Jose bar Zevida, he said to me: You must pass before them, so that they will see you and stand in your presence. Then you will bring them to the point of fearing Heaven, as stated (in Lev. 19:32): <small>YOU SHALL RISE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GRAY HEAD, &#x003C;YOU SHALL HONOR THE PRESENCE OF AN ELDER,&#x003E; AND YOU SHALL FEAR YOUR GOD</small>. Why? Because the rise of the righteous is a rise in which there is no decline. But the rise of Esau<sup><xref rid="fn389">70</xref></sup> the Wicked is a rise which is wholly decline. Today he is a governor;<sup><xref rid="fn390">71</xref></sup> tomorrow a commoner;<sup><xref rid="fn391">72</xref></sup> the next day an imperial cabinet member<sup><xref rid="fn392">73</xref></sup> the day after that a captain.<sup><xref rid="fn393">74</xref></sup> And thus it is with all their great ones. So also the Prophet says (in Obad. vs. 4): <small>THOUGH YOU MAKE YOUR ABODE AS HIGH AS THE EAGLE, AND THOUGH YOUR NEST IS SET AMONG THE STARS, I WILL BRING YOU DOWN FROM THERE, SAYS THE LORD</small>. The rise of Jacob, however, is a rise which has no decline, and their holiness is never desecrated. And so you find that the elders are one of thirteen things which are written down as belonging to the name of the Holy One. These &#x003C;thirteen&#x003E; are the following: (1) The silver and gold, (2) the priests, (3) the Levites, (4) Israel, (5) the first-born, (6) the altar, (7) the priestly share, (8) the oil for anointing, (9) the tent of meeting, (10) the Davidic dynasty, (11) the offerings, (12) the land of Israel, and (13) the elders.</p>

<title>3.21 Numbers 11:16ff Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.] This text is related (to Amos. 9:6): <small>WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS AND FOUNDS HIS CELESTIAL VAULT</small> (<italic>aguddah</italic>) <small>UPON EARTH</small>. To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn396">77</xref></sup> To a palace<sup><xref rid="fn397">78</xref></sup> that was built upon boats. For as long a time that the boats are connected the palace that is upon them will stand. Similarly (in Amos 9:6): <small>WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS&#x2026;</small>. When is his throne, as it were, &#x007B;perfumed&#x007D; [established]<sup><xref rid="fn398">79</xref></sup> above?<sup><xref rid="fn399">80</xref></sup> When Israel becomes one society (<italic>aguddah</italic>). It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>WHO BUILDS HIS UPPER CHAMBERS IN THE HEAVENS</small>. When? When (ibid. cont.:) <small>HE FOUNDS HIS CELESTIAL VAULT</small> (<italic>aguddah</italic>, which also means <small>SOCIETY</small>) <small>ON EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn400">81</xref></sup> And so it says (in Deut. 33:5): <small>THEN HE BECAME KING IN JESHURUN, WHEN THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE ASSEMBLED, THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL TOGETHER</small>. Therefore the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>. Why? Because a gathering of righteous people is enjoyment for them and enjoyment for the world, but a gathering of wicked people is an offense to them and an offense to the world.</p>
<title>3.22 Numbers 11:16ff Part III</title>
<p>Another Interpretation (of Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE &#x003C;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. When the Holy one said to Moses: <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>, Moses said: How shall I manage to get &#x003C;them&#x003E; from all the tribes?<sup><xref rid="fn401">82</xref></sup> If I get five each from every tribe, they will not add up to the number seventy. [There will only be sixty.] And if we get six each from every tribe, they will add up to the number seventy-two. But if we get five from one tribe and six from another, I shall be imposing jealousy among the tribes. What did Moses do? R. Judah says: He took seventy pieces of paper<sup><xref rid="fn402">83</xref></sup> and wrote &#x201C;Elder&#x201D; on them. Then he took another &#x007B;seventy&#x007D; [two] blank pieces of paper, mixed them up, put them in an urn,<sup><xref rid="fn403">84</xref></sup> and said to them: Come and take your pieces of paper. Whoever took a paper with &#x201C;elder&#x201D; written on it knew that he had been appointed an elder. Whoever came up with a blank paper in his hand knew that he had not been appointed an elder. R. Nehemiah said to him: There would still have been a controversy, since &#x003C;a loser&#x003E; could have said to him: Where is a paper with &#x201C;elder&#x201D; written on it? If it had been there, it would have come up in my hand. Therefore, how did he manage for them? R. Nehemiah said: He took seventy-two pieces of paper and wrote &#x201C;Elder&#x201D; on them plus seventy two other blank pieces of paper. Then he mixed them up and put them in the urn. He said to them: Come and take your papers. If a paper with &#x201C;elder&#x201D; written on it came up in &#x003C;a person&#x2019;s&#x003E; hand he knew that he had been appointed an elder, but if a blank one came up in his hand he knew that he had not been not appointed. Then the officer-in-charge would say to him: Look there is another paper there with &#x201C;elder&#x201D; written upon it. If you had been worthy of being appointed, &#x003C;a paper with &#x201C;elder&#x201D;&#x003E; would have come up in your hand. When Moses had followed this &#x003C;procedure&#x003E; the elders were appointed. Eldad and Medad were there, but they excluded themselves. They said: We are not worthy to be in the number (<italic>minyan</italic>) of the elders. Now because they excluded themselves, they were found superior to the elders in five respects.</p>
<ol>
<li>The elders only prophesied for the morrow as stated (in Numb. 11:18): <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THE PEOPLE</small>: [<small>PURIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE MORROW</small>], but these men prophesied what was going to happen at the end of forty years as stated (in Numb. 11:26&#x2013;27): <small>BUT TWO MEN HAD REMAINED IN THE CAMP</small>. [<small>THE NAME OF THE ONE WAS ELDAD AND THE NAME OF THE OTHER WAS MEDAD &#x2026;; &#x003C;AND THEY WERE &#x2026; &#x003E; PROPHESYING IN THE CAMP</small>.] But what were they prophesying? Some say &#x003C;they were prophesying&#x003E; about the downfall of Gog and Magog, while others say they were prophesying that Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the land. You yourself know that they so prophesied, since it is stated (in vs. 28): <small>THEN JOSHUA BEN NUN, MOSES&#x2019; ATTENDANT FROM HIS YOUTH, ANSWERED AND SAID: MY LORD MOSES RESTRAIN THEM</small>. (vs. 27): <small>BUT A LAD RAN AND TOLD MOSES&#x2026;</small>. And who was it? It was Moses&#x2019; son Gershom.</li>
<li>The elders did not enter the land, but these did enter the land. Eldad is &#x003C;so listed&#x003E; (in Numb. 34:21) &#x003C;as&#x003E; <small>ELIDAD BEN CHISLON</small>. Medad is &#x003C;so listed&#x003E; (in Numb. 34:24) &#x003C;as&#x003E; <small>KEMUEL BEN SHIPHTAN</small>.</li>
<li>The elders were not designated by their names, but these were designated by their names.</li>
<li>The elders had their prophecy cease, but these did not have their prophecy cease. It is so stated (of the seventy in Numb. 11:25): <small>THEY PROPHESIED BUT DID NOT CONTINUE</small>.</li>
<li>In the case of the elders, their prophecy was from what belonged to Moses, even as the Scripture has said (in Numb. 11:17): <small>AND I WILL SET ASIDE SOME OF THE SPIRIT &#x003C;WHICH IS UPON YOU AND PUT IT ON THEM&#x003E;</small>; but these &#x003C;two&#x003E; had their prophecy from that which belonged to the Holy One, as stated (in Numb. 11:26): <small>AND THE SPIRIT RESTED UPON THEM</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now if you say: Since the elders had their prophecy from what belonged to Moses, might it not have lessened his prophecy somewhat? &#x003C;The answer is&#x003E; No. To what may Moses be compared? To a lamp which was burning.<sup><xref rid="fn404">85</xref></sup> Everyone lights up from it, but its light is in no way diminished. So also in the case of Moses. Although the prophets took of his prophecy, the prophecy of Moses was in no way diminished. [It is so stated] (in Deut. 34:10): <small>AND NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES</small>.</p>
<title>3.23 Numbers 11:16ff Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>. Did they not have elders in the past?<sup><xref rid="fn405">86</xref></sup> Was it not already stated in Egypt (in Exod. 3:16): <small>GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>? So for what reason had the Holy One said (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME</small> &#x2026;? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; to teach you that when Pharaoh had said (in Exod. 1:10): <small>COME LET US ACT SHREWDLY</small>, Pharaoh gathered all Israel. He said to them: Please work with me as a favor today. This is what is written (in vs. 13): <small>SO THE EGYPTIANS MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL LABOR WITH RUTHLESSNESS</small> (<italic>befarekh</italic>). At first it was with with gentle speech (<italic>befeh rakh</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn406">87</xref></sup> Pharaoh took a basket and trowel, and whoever [saw Pharaoh] taking basket and trowel and working with bricks worked too. Israel immediately went quickly, and vigorously applied their skill along with him all the day, because they were strong and mighty. When it grew dark, he posted taskmasters over them. He said to them: Reckon the &#x003C; number of&#x003E; bricks. They immediately arose and counted them. He said to them: This many you shall produce for me each and every day. He assigned Egyptian taskmasters over the officers of Israel, and the officers were assigned over the rest of the people. Moreover when he said to them (in Exod. 5:7): <small>YOU SHALL NO LONGER GIVE THE PEOPLE STRAW</small>, the taskmasters came and counted the bricks. &#x003C;If&#x003E; they were found &#x003C;the bricks&#x003E; deficient, the taskmasters beat the officers, as stated (in Exod. 5:14): <small>AND THE OFFICERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, WHOM &#x003C;THE TASKMASTERS OF PHARAOH&#x003E; HAD SET OVER THEM, WERE BEATEN&#x2026;</small>. When the officers were beaten for the rest of the people, they did not hand them over into the hands of the taskmasters, for they said: It is better for us to be beaten that the rest of the people may not be weakened. Therefore when the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>, Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe I do not know who is worthy and who is not worthy. He said to him (in Numb. 11:16 cont.:) <small>WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>. These are the officers who had handed themselves over to be beaten on their behalf in Egypt because of the required amount of bricks. Let them come and receive this dignity. It therefore says (ibid.): <small>WHOM YOU KNOW TO BE</small> [<small>ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>]. From here you learn that whoever hands himself over for the sake of Israel merits glory and dignity. It is therefore written (ibid.): <small>WHOM YOU KNOW</small> [<small>TO BE ELDERS AND OFFICERS OF THE PEOPLE</small>. Who are they? The ones of whom it is written] (in Exod. 5:14): <small>AND THE OFFICERS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;WHOM THE TASKMASTERS OF PHARAOH HAD SET OVER THEM&#x003E; WERE BEATEN</small>.</p>
<title>3.24 Numbers 11:16ff Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> But where were those former ones?<sup><xref rid="fn407">88</xref></sup> This text is related (to Job 34:24): <small>HE SHATTERS MIGHTY ONES WITHOUT INQUIRY</small> [<small>AND RAISES UP OTHERS IN THEIR STEAD</small>]. When the princes (i.e. the people of Israel) were in Egypt, they had seventy elders as stated (in Exod. 3:16): <small>GO AND GATHER THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>; and with them they went out of Egypt. Moreover when Moses went up &#x003C;on Sinai&#x003E; to receive the Torah, they were &#x003C;still&#x003E; with him, as stated (in Exod. 24:9): <small>THEN THERE WENT UP MOSES AND AARON, NADAB, ABIHU, AND THE SEVENTY ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>. (Exod. 24:14:) <small>BUT UNTO THE ELDERS HE HAD SAID: WAIT</small> [<small>FOR US</small>] <small>HERE&#x2026;</small>. When Moses had gone up, he had agreed with Israel to come down at the end of forty days. When he delayed coming down, even as it is stated (in Exod. 32:1): <small>WHEN THE PEOPLE SAW THAT MOSES WAS LATE</small> (<italic>boshesh</italic>) &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn408">89</xref></sup> Now <italic>boshesh</italic> can only mean a delay since it is stated (in Judg. 5:28): <small>WHY IS HIS CHARIOT LATE</small> (<italic>boshesh</italic>) <small>IN COMING; WHY ARE THE HOOF-BEATS OF HIS CHARIOTS DELAYING</small>? All Israel came together to the elders. They said to them: Moses agreed with us that he would come down in forty days. Now here it is forty days and he has not come down. And in addition, six hours more &#x003C;have passed&#x003E;;<sup><xref rid="fn409">90</xref></sup> yet we do not know what has happened to him. So (in the words of Exod. 32:1 cont.) <small>ARISE AND MAKE A GOD FOR US</small>. When they heard that, they said to them: Why are you making him angry, you for whom he performed all the miracles and wonders? They rose up against them and killed them. Then because Hur had stood (&#x2018;<italic><small>MD</small></italic>) up to them with harsh words, they (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MD</small></italic>) rose up against him and killed him. [Where is it shown that they killed the elders and Hur?]<sup><xref rid="fn410">91</xref></sup> Where Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 2:34-35): <small>MOREOVER ON YOUR SKIRTS THERE IS FOUND THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE INNOCENT POOR. YOU DID NOT FIND THEM BREAKING IN; YET FOR OF ALL THESE &#x003C;YOU SAY: I AM INNOCENT&#x003E;</small>. [What is the significance of <small>FOR ALL THESE</small> (<italic>elleh</italic>)?] &#x003C;It is&#x003E; because of (the statement in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS</small> (<italic>elleh</italic>) <small>IS YOUR GOD O ISRAEL</small>. After a time, when the Holy One had forgiven them, he said to Moses (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE &#x003C;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small> in place of those who were killed for the sanctification of my name.

<title>3.25 Numbers 11:16ff Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 12:11): <small>THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS</small>. Just as a goad brings living (<italic>hayyim</italic>) &#x003C;animals&#x003E; to their yoke (<italic><small>L</small>&#x2018;<small>WLM</small></italic> voweled as <italic>la&#x2018;ullam</italic>) so do the words of Torah bring life (<italic>hayyim</italic>) to the world (<italic><small>L</small>&#x2018;<small>WLM</small></italic> voweled as <italic>la&#x2018;olam</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn411">92</xref></sup> It is so written (in Deut. 30:20): <small>&#x003C;TO LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD, HEED HIS COMMANDS, AND HOLD FAST TO HIM &#x003E; FOR THAT IS YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LENGTH OF DAYS</small>. [Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11): <small>&#x003C;THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS</small>.] Just as the goad directs the cow to plow the furrows evenly;<sup><xref rid="fn412">93</xref></sup> so do the words of Torah direct [those who study them] to say: Forbidden, over what is forbidden, &#x003C;to say:&#x003E; Permitted, over what is permitted; and &#x003C;the words of the wise also&#x003E; show texts and interpretations from the Torah. (Eccl. 12:11:) <small>THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS</small>. Three names are applied to it (i.e., to a goad): <italic>Darban, mardea</italic>&#x2018;, <italic>malmad</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn413">94</xref></sup> Why is it named <italic>malmad</italic> (<italic><small>MLMD</small></italic>)? Because it teaches (<italic><small>MLMD</small></italic>) the cow to plow. <italic>Mardea&#x2018;</italic>? Because it teaches knowledge (<italic>moreh de&#x2018;ah</italic>) to the cow for plowing. <italic>Darban?</italic> Because it (the goad) dwells (<italic>dar</italic>) in it (<italic>bah</italic>, i.e., in the cow) as understanding (<italic>bineh</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn414">95</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 12:11): <small>THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS</small>. And if you say: Just as the goad is removable, so are the words of Torah removable, the text reads (ibid. cont.): <small>AND LIKE IMPLANTED NAILS</small> (<italic><small>MSMRWT</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn415">96</xref></sup> <small>LIKE GUARDS</small> (<italic><small>MS</small>h<small>MRWT</small></italic>) is what is &#x003C;also&#x003E; written. If you have inserted them as a nail (<italic><small>MSMR</small></italic>), they are guards (<italic><small>MS</small>h<small>MRWT</small></italic>) and will preserve you.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11 cont.): <small>AND LIKE IMPLANTED NAILS</small>. From here the sages have said: It is forbidden to read in the profane books. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>AND LIKE IMPLANTED NAILS</small> (<italic><small>MSMRWT</small></italic>). Just as the divisions (<italic><small>MS</small>h<small>MRWT</small></italic>) of the priests number twenty-four, so also do the books &#x003C;of the Bible&#x003E; number twenty-four. (Ibid.:) <small>&#x003C;AND LIKE IMPLANTED NAILS ARE&#x003E; THE MASTERS OF WHAT ARE ASSEMBLED</small>. These &#x003C;masters&#x003E; are the Sanhedrin.<sup><xref rid="fn416">97</xref></sup> And if you say: This person permits what another forbids, this one declares unfit what another declares fit, this one declares unclean what another declares clean, [R. Eliezer obligates while R. Joshua exempts], and Bet Shammay &#x007B;condemns&#x007D; [prohibits] while Bet Hillel permits; to whom should I listen? Nevertheless all of them (according to Eccl. 12:11 end) <small>WERE GIVEN FROM ONE SHEPHERD</small>.</p>

<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PERSON</small> (<italic>sic</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn417">98</xref></sup> <small>FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn418">99</xref></sup> [This text is related (to Prov. 22:11): <small>THE ONE WHO LOVES PURITY OF HEART HAS GRACE ON HIS LIPS, HAS A KING AS HIS FRIEND</small>.] Why did he not say to him (in Numb. 11:16): &#x201C;Seventy people&#x201D; (with &#x201C;people&#x201D; in the plural) instead of <small>SEVENTY PERSON</small>. It is simply that he said to him: <small>SEVENTY PERSON</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) &#x003C;with the singular <italic>ish</italic> indicating&#x003E; singular individuals],<sup><xref rid="fn419">100</xref></sup> because they were to be like me and you. (Cf. Exod. 15:3:) <small>THE LORD IS A MAN</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>OF WAR</small>. (Cf. also Numb. 12:3): <small>NOW THE MAN</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>MOSES</small>.</p>
<title>3.27 Numbers 11:16ff Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. But did you not have elders before?<sup><xref rid="fn420">101</xref></sup> Here now it is written concerning Mount Sinai (in Exod. 24:9): <small>THEN THERE WENT UP MOSES &#x2026; AND THE SEVENTY ELDERS OF ISRAEL</small>; and this parashah (with Numb. 11:16) comes after that. So where were the&#x003C;se earlier&#x003E; elders? It is simply that, when Israel did those things which are stated (in Numb. 11:1): <small>NOW THE PEOPLE WERE AS MURMURERS</small> [&#x2026;. <small>THEN THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AGAINST THEM</small>], they were all destroyed by fire at that time. It is simply that their burning was like the burning of Nadab and Abihu, for they also had acted with disrespect on ascending Sinai, when they saw the Divine Presence. It is so stated (in Exod. 24:11): <small>THEY BEHELD GOD, AND THEY ATE AND DRANK</small>. Was there eating and drinking there? To what is the matter comparable? To a servant who attended his master while &#x003C;holding&#x003E; a slice of bread in his hand and taking bites from it. Similarly had they acted with disrespect as though eating and drinking. So the elders along with Nadab and Abihu deserved to be destroyed by fire on that day; but because the giving of Torah was dear to the Holy One, he therefore did not want to harm them and bring calamity to them on that day. This is what is written (ibid.): <small>BUT HE</small> (the Holy One) <small>STILL DID NOT RAISE HIS HAND AGAINST THE NOBLES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. From this you may infer that they deserved to have a hand raised &#x003C;against them&#x003E;. After a time, however, they were destroyed by fire. Nadab and Abihu were destroyed by fire as they entered the tent of meeting, while the elders were destroyed by fire when they were filled with lusting, as stated (in Numb. 11:4): <small>THEN THE RABBLE WHICH WAS IN THEIR MIDST &#x003C;BECAME FILLED WITH LUST&#x003E;</small>. Who were <small>THE RABBLE</small> (<italic>ha&#x2019;safsuf</italic>)? R. Simeon ben Menasya and R. Simeon bar Abba &#x003C;differed&#x003E;. One said: These were the proselytes who came up with them from Egypt and who were gathered (<italic>ne&#x2019;esafim</italic>) together with them as stated (in Exod. 12:38): <small>AND A MIXED MULTITUDE &#x003C;WENT UP WITH THEM&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. But the other said: <small>RABBLE</small> can only be a sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Numb. 11:16:) <small>GATHER ME</small> [<small>SEVENTY PEOPLE</small>] <small>&#x003C;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. What &#x003C;else&#x003E; is written there (in vs. 1)? <small>THEN THE FIRE OF THE LORD BURNED AGAINST THEM AND CONSUMED THEM IN THE OUTSKIRTS</small> (<italic>qetseh</italic>) <small>OF THE CAMP</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; among the officers (<italic>qetsinim</italic>) in the camp. And where is it shown that those elders who went up onto the mountain were destroyed by fire? Where it is stated (in Ps. 106:18): <small>AND FIRE BROKE OUT IN THEIR COMPANY</small> (&#x2018;<italic>edah</italic>), since <small>COMPANY</small> (&#x2018;<italic>edah</italic>) can only be a sanhedrin as stated (in Numb. 15:24): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT IF IT WAS DONE &#x003C;BY MISTAKE&#x003E; AWAY FROM THE EYES OF THE CONGREGATION</small> (&#x2018;<italic>edah</italic>)&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn421">102</xref></sup> It is also written (in Lev. 4:13): <small>AND IF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small> (&#x2018;<italic>edah</italic>) <small>OF ISRAEL</small><sup><xref rid="fn422">103</xref></sup> <small>SHOULD ERR</small>? Then they wept again and demanded meat. Now if you should say: What they wanted was flesh (not manna), did it not come about that the manna became whatever they wanted inside of their mouths. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 106:15): <small>SO HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY ASKED FOR</small>. Again in case you should say that they did not have oxen and cattle in the desert, he caused to be written (in Exod. 12:38): <small>AND A MIXED MULTITUDE WENT UP WITH THEM WITH FLOCKS AND HERDS</small>. And in case you should say they ate them in the desert, is it not written (in Numb. 32:1): <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>? From here R. Simeon said: It was not flesh for which they lusted, since it says so (in Ps. 78:27): <small>AND HE RAINED DOWN MEAT</small> (<italic>she&#x2019;er</italic>) <small>UPON THEM LIKE DUST</small>. Now <italic>she&#x2019;er</italic> must denote illicit intercourse since it is stated (in Lev. 18:6): <small>NONE OF YOU SHALL APPROACH ANY CLOSE</small> (<italic>she&#x2019;er</italic>) <small>RELATION TO HIM</small>. Ergo, it &#x003C;really&#x003E; says that they desired to permit illicit intercourse for themselves; and so it says (in Numb. 11:10): <small>NOW MOSES HEARD THE PEOPLE WEEPING FOR THEIR FAMILIES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn423">104</xref></sup> Thus when they desired such &#x003C;relations&#x003E; (ibid. cont.:) <small>THE LORD WAS VERY ANGRY&#x2026;</small>. At that time Moses said to the Holy One (in vs. 11): <small>WHY HAVE YOU MISTREATED YOUR SERVANT</small> &#x2026;? In the past there was one with me who would bear the burden of Israel, but now I am alone. Thus it is written (in vs. 14&#x2014;15): <small>I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR &#x003C;ALL THIS PEOPLE ALONE &#x2026; SO IF YOU ARE DEALING LIKE THIS WITH ME&#x2026;</small>. At that time the Holy One said to him: Appoint other elders instead of those elders. [It is so stated] (in vs. 16): <small>GATHER ME SEVENTY PEOPLE &#x003C;FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>3.28 Numbers 11:16ff Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 11:17:) <small>THEN I WILL COME DOWN AND SPEAK WITH YOU THERE</small>. &#x003C;This verse is&#x003E; to inform you that the day for appointing elders was as dear to the Holy One as the day for the giving of Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn424">105</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Exod. 19:11): <small>FOR ON THE THIRD DAY THE LORD WILL COME DOWN &#x2026; &#x003C;UPON MOUNT SINAI&#x003E;</small>; and also (in Numb. 11:17) with reference to appointing the elders, <small>I WILL COME DOWN</small> is written. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and hired a guard for it. Then he gave him the payment of a guard for him to guard to orchard. After a time the guard said to him: I cannot guard all of it myself. Rather give me others to guard it with me. The king said to him: I have given the entire orchard into your keeping, and I have given you all the payment for guarding it; but now you would say to me: Go and bring others to guard it with me. See I am bringing others to guard with you, but observe that I am not giving them their payment from what belongs to me. Rather it is from your payment which I have given you that they are receiving their payment. Similarly did the Holy One speak to Moses. When &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; said to him: I cannot &#x003C;do everything&#x003E; alone; the Holy One said to him: I have given you understanding and knowledge to sustain<sup><xref rid="fn425">106</xref></sup> my children. Moreover, I did not want others, merely so that you would have strength and knowledge and so that you would stand alone in that greatness. But now you are the one who wants others. Be aware that they will receive &#x003C;payment&#x003E;, not from what is mine, but from what is yours. It is so stated (in Numb. 11:17.): <small>AND I WILL SET ASIDE SOME OF THE SPIRIT WHICH IS UPON YOU &#x003C;AND PUT IT ON THEM&#x003E;</small>. Nevertheless Moses did not lack anything. You should know that after forty years he said to Moses (in Numb. 27:18, 20): <small>TAKE JOSHUA BEN NUN &#x2026; AND PUT SOME OF YOUR GLORY UPON HIM</small>. Then what is written about Joshua (in Deut. 34:9)? <small>NOW JOSHUA BEN NUN WAS FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM</small>. Why? (Ibid. cont.:) <small>BECAUSE MOSES HAD LAID HIS HANDS UPON HIM</small>. The Holy One said: In this world individuals have prophesied, but in the world to come all Israel shall become prophets. It is so stated (in Joel 3:1 [2:28]): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS AFTERWARD THAT I WILL POUR OUT MY SPIRIT UPON ALL FLESH SO THAT YOUR SONS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn426">107</xref></sup></p>

<title>Chapter 4 Numbers, Parashah IV: <italic>Shelah</italic></title>
<title>4.1 Numbers 13:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&#x003E;: SEND MEN TO EXPLORE THE LAND OF CANAAN</small>. Thus did Rabbi Tanhuma bar Abba interpret. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted to set sail on the Great Sea (i.e., the Mediterranean) three days before the Sabbath?<sup><xref rid="fn427">1</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in Shab. 19a [bar.]): One does not set sail in a ship on the Great Sea three days before the Sabbath, when one wants to go to a distant place. If, however, one desires to set sail from Tyre to Sidon, for example, it is permitted for one to set sail even on the Sabbath eve, because it is a known fact that one can go &#x003C;there&#x003E; while it is still daylight. Now these words concern agents with freedom of action; but in the case of agents for &#x003C;carrying out&#x003E; a commandment, it is permitted for &#x003C;such a&#x003E; one to set sail on whatever day he wants. Why? Because he is an agent for &#x003C; carrying out&#x003E; a commandment, and an agent for &#x003C;carrying out&#x003E; a commandment overrides the Sabbath. And so you find with reference to the Sukkah that they have taught (in <italic>Suk.</italic> 2:4): <small>AGENTS FOR &#x003C;CARRYING OUT&#x003E; A RELIGIOUS DUTY ARE EXEMPTED FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF&#x003E; THE SUKKAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn428">2</xref></sup> You have no one so dear to the Holy One as an agent, when he is sent to carry out a religious duty and is risking his life to succeed in it. And you have none who were sent to carry out a religious duty and who risked their lives to succeed in their mission like those two whom Joshua ben Nun sent. [Thus it is stated (in Josh. 2:1): <small>THEN &#x003C;JOSHUA BEN NUN&#x003E; SENT TWO SPIES &#x003C;FROM SHITTIM&#x003E; SECRETLY, SAYING:</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; Who were they? Our masters have taught: These were Phinehas and Caleb. They had gone and risked their lives in order to be successful in their mission. What is the implication of <small>SECRETLY</small> (<italic>heresh</italic>)? That they made themselves out to be potters and cried: Here are pots. Whoever wants &#x003C;some&#x003E;, let him come and buy. &#x003C;Their disguise was&#x003E; so that no one would notice them. Do &#x003C;not&#x003E; read <small>&#x003C;SECRETLY</small> (<italic>heresh</italic>)&#x003E; in this &#x003C;verse but&#x003E; <small>POTS</small> (<italic>heres</italic>). &#x003C;They had made themselves out to be potters&#x003E; lest people say that they were spies. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO THEY WENT AND CAME</small> &#x007B;<small>UN</small>&#x007D;<small>TO THE HOUSE OF A WOMAN WHO WAS A HARLOT</small> &#x003C; <small>WHOSE NAME WAS RAHAB&#x003E;</small>. She arose and received them. The king of Jericho became aware of them and heard that they had come to explore the land, as stated (in vs. 2): <small>BUT IT WAS TOLD THE KING OF JERICHO</small> [&#x2026;.] When they came to look for them, what did Rahab do? She took them away to hide them. Phinehas said to her: I am a priest, and the priests are comparable to the angels (<italic>mal&#x2019;akhim</italic>), as stated (in Mal. 2:7): &#x007B;<small>MOREOVER</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THE LIPS OF A PRIEST PRESERVE KNOWLEDGE, AND THEY SEEK TORAH FROM HIS MOUTH, BECAUSE HE IS A MESSENGER</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>OF THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. Now an angel desiring &#x003C;to be visible&#x003E; is visible; and one desiring &#x003C;to be invisible&#x003E; is not visible. But where is it shown that the prophets were called angels? Where it is stated (in Numb. 20:16): <small>AND HE SENT A MESSENGER</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>WHO BROUGHT US OUT OF EGYPT</small>. And was he not Moses? Hence the prophets are likened to angels (<italic>mal&#x2019;akhim</italic>). Now where is it shown that &#x003C;Rahab&#x003E; had only hidden Caleb? Where it is stated (in Josh. 2:4): <small>SO</small> [<small>THE WOMAN</small>] <small>TOOK THE TWO MEN AND CONCEALED <italic>HIM</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn429">3</xref></sup> &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach you how much these two righteous men risked themselves to fulfill their mission. But the agents whom Moses sent were wicked. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter] (in Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND MEN &#x003C;TO EXPLORE THE LAND OF CANAAN</small> &#x003E;.</p>
<title>4.2 Numbers 13:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND MEN TO EXPLORE&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 76:6 [5]): <small>THE STOUT-HEARTED WERE DESPOILED; THEY WERE ASLEEP IN THEIR SLUMBER; NOR DID ANY OF THE VALIANT MEN LIFT A HAND</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>THE STOUT-HEARTED WERE DESPOILED</small>, namely Moses and Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn430">4</xref></sup> After they sent out the spies, these came and made an evil report about the land. They did not know what to do. Actually, even Moses and Aaron were negligent over the report. Immediately Caleb stood up and silenced all those hosts,<sup><xref rid="fn431">5</xref></sup> as stated (in Numb. 13:30): <small>THEN CALEB HUSHED &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. He stood on a stool<sup><xref rid="fn432">6</xref></sup> and had them become silent. Then he said to them: [Has the son of Amram only done this to us?] So they became silent in order to hear from him. He said to them (in Numb. 14:7): <small>THE LAND IS VERY VERY GOOD</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: I am exceedingly grateful to Caleb, as stated (in Deut. 1:36): <small>&#x003C;NONE&#x003E; EXCEPT CALEB BEN JEPHUNNEH. &#x003C;HE SHALL SEE IT, AND TO HIM I WILL GIVE THE LAND&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; What is the meaning of <small>EXCEPT</small> (<italic><small>ZWLTY</small></italic>)? <small>THIS MAN JOINING ME</small> (<italic><small>ZH LWH &#x2019;TY</small></italic>) is &#x003C;worth&#x003E; more than sixty myriads of you. You did not find your hands (i.e., your courage); therefore you were indecisive. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 76:6 [5]): <small>THE STOUT-HEARTED WERE DESPOILED; &#x003C;THEY WERE ASLEEP IN THEIR SLUMBER; NOR DID ANY OF THE VALIANT MEN LIFT A HAND&#x003E;</small>. Why all this? Because they were foolish agents. [It is with reference to them that Solomon has said (in Prov. 26:6): <small>THE ONE WHO SENDS A MESSAGE THROUGH A FOOL IS CUTTING OFF &#x003C;HIS OWN&#x003E; FEET AND DRINKING VIOLENCE</small>.</p>
<title>4.3 Numbers 13:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND MEN&#x2026;</small>. R. Aha the Great opened (with Is. 40:8): <small>GRASS WITHERS, FLOWERS FADE, BUT THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn433">7</xref></sup> To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a friend. Now he made an agreement with him and said to him: Come with me, and I will give you a present. He went with him but died. The king said to the son of his friend: Although your father has died, I am not withdrawing the present that I had promised to give him. Come and get it. This king is the Holy One, and the friend is Abraham, as stated (in Is. 41:8): <small>THE SEED OF MY FRIEND ABRAHAM</small>. The Holy One said to him: Come with me, as stated (in Gen. 12:1): <small>GO FROM YOUR LAND</small>. He made an agreement with him to give him a present, as stated (in Gen. 13:17): <small>ARISE, WALK ABOUT THE LAND</small> [&#x2026;], <small>FOR I AM GIVING IT TO YOU</small>. It also says (in vs. 15): <small>FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, TO YOU WILL I GIVE IT</small>, [<small>AND TO YOUR SEED FOREVER</small>]. The Holy One said to Moses: Although I had agreed with the ancestors to give them the land, and even though they have died, I am not going back on &#x003C;my word&#x003E;. Instead (according to Is. 40:8): <small>BUT THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOR EVER</small>.</p>
<title>4.4 Numbers 13:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:2:) <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND MEN FOR YOURSELF</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn434">8</xref></sup> This text is related (to Prov. 10:26): <small>LIKE VINEGAR TO THE TEETH AND LIKE SMOKE TO THE EYES, SO IS THE LAZY PERSON TO THOSE WHO SEND HIM</small>. The spies were known to have spoken blasphemy against the land, as stated (in Jer. 9:2): <small>FOR THEY HAVE BENT THEIR TONGUES AS A BOW OF FALSEHOOD, AND IT IS NOT FOR TRUTH THAT THEY HAVE GROWN MIGHTY IN THE LAND</small>. To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn435">9</xref></sup> To a king who had a vineyard. Whenever he saw that the wine was good, he would say to his tenants: Put it in my house; but whenever he saw that it was sour, he would say to his tenants: Put it in your houses. So also here. When the Holy One saw that the elders were worthy, he called them in his own name, as stated (in Numb. 11:16): <small>GATHER ME &#x003C;SEVENTY PEOPLE FROM THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> When he saw that the spies were going to sin, he called them by Moses&#x2019; name, as stated (in Numb. 13:2): <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &#x003C;MEN&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>4.5 Numbers 13:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>[(Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND PEOPLE</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>).]<sup><xref rid="fn436">10</xref></sup> In every place that <italic>anashim</italic> is used, the people are righteous, [for so it says (in Exod. 17:9): <small>THEN MOSES SAID TO JOSHUA: CHOOSE MEN</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>) <small>FOR US</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn437">11</xref></sup> And so it says (in I Sam. 17:12): <small>AND IN THE DAYS OF SAUL THE MAN</small> (Jesse) <small>HAD COME TO AN ELDERLY AGE AMONG HUMANS</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>). And similarly does Hannah say (in I Sam. 1:11): <small>AND IF YOU GRANT YOUR HANDMAID HUMAN</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>) <small>OFFSPRING</small>. Now you are calling these &#x003C;spies&#x003E; fools (in Prov. 26:6): <small>THE ONE WHO SENDS A MESSAGE THROUGH A FOOL&#x0021;</small> But these were only called fools because they had uttered malicious slander against the land, as stated (in Prov. 10:18): <small>AND THE ONE WHO UTTERS SLANDER IS A FOOL</small>. But nevertheless they had &#x003C;once&#x003E; been great human beings, although they had made themselves foolish. So it is on account of them that Moses says (in Deut. 32:20): <small>FOR THEY ARE A PERVERSE GENERATION&#x2026;</small>. Thus they were chosen from all of Israel at the command of the Holy One and at the command of Moses, as stated (in Deut. 1:23): <small>NOW THE PLAN SEEMED GOOD IN MY EYES; SO I TOOK &#x003C;TWELVE MEN</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>)&#x003E; <small>FROM YOU, &#x003C;ONE FOR EACH TRIBE&#x003E;</small>. &#x007B;Where is it shown?&#x007D; [Hence] you &#x003C;can&#x003E; say that they were righteous in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of Moses. In addition Moses did not want to send them until he had consulted with the Holy One over each and every one. [When he had said &#x003C;for each one&#x003E;:] So-and-so from [such-and-such tribe], the Holy One said to him: They are acceptable. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 13:3): <small>SO MOSES SENT THEM FROM THE DESERT OF PARAN AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small>; [<small>THEY ALL WERE PEOPLE</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>) <small>WHO WERE THE HEADS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>]. Then after that, at the end of forty days, they changed and made all that trouble. So they caused that generation to be afflicted with that punishment, as stated (in Deut. 32:20): F<small>OR THEY ARE A PERVERSE GENERATION</small>. Because when they were chosen, &#x003C;they were&#x003E; righteous. [Then they changed.] It is therefore stated (in Numb. 13:2): <small>SEND PEOPLE</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>).</p>
<title>4.6 Numbers 13:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>[(Numb. 13:2:) <small>SEND MEN</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 44:18): <small>THEY NEITHER KNOW NOR UNDERSTAND</small>; &#x007B;<small>THEY WALK IN DARKNESS</small>,&#x007D; <small>FOR THEIR EYES ARE STUCK SHUT SO THAT THEY CANNOT SEE</small>. What is the reason for saying, <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &#x003C;MEN&#x003E;</small>, after the episode of Miriam (in Numb. 12:1ff.)?<sup><xref rid="fn438">12</xref></sup> It is simply that it was anticipated by the Holy One that they would come and utter slander against the land.<sup><xref rid="fn439">13</xref></sup> The Holy One had said that they should not &#x003C;be able to&#x003E; say: We did not know what the penalty for slander was. For that reason he put this &#x003C;story&#x003E; next to the one &#x003C;in which&#x003E; Miriam was afflicted with leprosy, because she had spoken &#x003C;slander&#x003E; against her brother. &#x003C;This affliction happened&#x003E; so that everyone would know the punishment for slander. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:1&#x2013;16, which ends): <small>THEN AFTER THAT THE PEOPLE JOURNEYED FROM HAZEROTH</small><sup><xref rid="fn440">14</xref></sup> <small>AND ENCAMPED IN THE DESERT OF PARAN</small>. &#x003C;It was a warning&#x003E; so that if they came to speak slander, they would consider the episode of Miriam; but even so, they did not desire to learn. It is therefore stated (in Is. 44:18): <small>THEY NEITHER KNOW NOR UNDERSTAND</small>. Therefore the Holy One wrote &#x003C;about&#x003E; the sending out of the spies after the episode of Miriam.</p>
<title>4.7 Numbers 13:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpetation (of Numb. 13:2:) <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND</small><sup><xref rid="fn441">15</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;MEN&#x003E;</small>. Even though the Holy One had said: <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &#x003C;MEN&#x003E;</small>, it was not &#x003C;the wish&#x003E; of the Holy One for them to go.<sup><xref rid="fn442">16</xref></sup> Why? Because the Holy One had already told them &#x003C;about&#x003E; the superiority of the land of Israel. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:7): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND</small>. And so it says (in Deut. 11:10&#x2013;11): <small>FOR THE LAND INTO WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO POSSESS&#x2026;. &#x003C;BUT THE LAND INTO WHICH YOU ARE CROSSING TO POSSESS IS A LAND OF MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS. IT DRINKS WATER FROM THE RAIN OF HEAVEN</small>.&#x003E; Moreover, while they had been in Egypt, he had said to them (in Exod. 3:8): <small>I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM &#x003C;OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP OUT OF THAT LAND&#x003E;</small> [<small>UNTO A GOOD &#x003C;AND SPACIOUS&#x003E; LAND&#x2026;.</small>] So what is the point of &#x003C;saying&#x003E; (in Numb. 13:2): <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND &#x003C;MEN&#x003E;</small>? It is simply that they wanted these words. When they reached &#x003C;Israel&#x2019;s&#x003E; borders, Moses had said to them (in Deut. 1:21): <small>SEE, THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS SET THE LAND BEFORE YOU</small>. At that time Israel approached Moses, as stated (in vs. 22): <small>THEN YOU ALL DREW NEAR UNTO ME AND SAID: LET US SEND MEN &#x003C;AHEAD OF US TO EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US</small>&#x003E;&#x2026;. This is what Ezra<sup><xref rid="fn443">17</xref></sup> said (in Neh. 9:17): <small>SO THEY REFUSED TO LISTEN AND WERE UNMINDFUL OF</small> &#x007B;<small>HIS</small>&#x007D; [<small>YOUR</small>] <small>WONDERS&#x2026;</small>. Now it says (in Numb. 10:33): <small>AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TRAVELED AHEAD OF THEM &#x2026; TO SEEK OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM</small>. &#x007B;However&#x007D; [And] they said (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &#x003C;AHEAD OF US TO EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. &#x007B;Is it not that they did not believe in his Torah?&#x007D; [It is simply that they did not believe in his Torah.] And similarly David said (in Ps. 78:22): <small>THEY DID NOT BELIEVE</small> &#x007B;<small>IN HIS TORAH</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN GOD</small>]&#x2026;. R. Joshua says: To what were they comparable: To a king who secured for his son a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. The king said to him: I have secured you a beautiful wife, the daughter of good and wealthy parents. There is no one like her in the whole world. The son said to him: Let me go to see her, for he did not believe in his father. Immediately the situation became ever more difficult for his father. His father said: What shall I do? If I say to him: I am not showing her to you, then he will say: She is ugly. For that reason he did not want to show her. Finally he said to him: Look at her, so that you may know that I have not deceived you. But because you did not believe in me, I swear that you shall not see her in your house. Instead I am giving her to your son. Now similarly did the Holy One say to Israel: &#x003C;The land&#x003E; is good, but they did not believe in him. They said (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &#x003C;AHEAD OF US&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: If I prevent them, they will say: The land is no good. For &#x003C;that reason&#x003E; he has not shown it to us. The Holy One said: They will only see it, for I swear that not one of them shall enter within it. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:23): <small>SURELY THEY SHALL NOT SEE THE LAND&#x2026;.</small> Instead I am giving it to their children.</p>
<title>4.8 Numbers 13:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>[(Numb. 13:2:) <small>YOU YOURSELF SEND MEN</small>.] When they said to Moses (in Deut. 1:22): <small>LET US SEND MEN &#x003C;AHEAD OF US&#x003E;</small>, Moses began to wonder. He said: It is impossible for me to do something before I consult with the Holy One. He went and consulted. He said to him: Your children want thus and so. The Holy One said to him: This is not the first time for them. While they were in Egypt, they jeered at me, as stated (in Hos. 7:16): <small>THIS WAS THEIR DERISION IN THE LAND OF EGYPT</small>. They are accustomed to such &#x003C;behavior&#x003E;, needless to say.<sup><xref rid="fn444">18</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Dan. 2:22): <small>HE KNOWS WHAT IS IN THE DARKNESS, &#x003C;AND THE LIGHT DWELLS WITH HIM&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: I know what they are [saying]; but if you want, [<small>YOU YOURSELF</small>] <small>SEND</small> [<small>MEN</small> on your] own. Where is it shown? Where it is written (in Numb. 13:16): <small>THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN WHOM MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND</small>.</p>
<title>4.9 Numbers 13:16ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:16, cont.:) <small>THEN MOSES CALLED HOSHEA</small> (<italic><small>HWS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;) <small>BEN NUN JOSHUA</small> (<italic><small>YHWS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;). What reason did Moses see for adding a <italic>yod</italic> (i.e., a <italic><small>Y</small></italic>) to Joshua&#x2019;s name?<sup><xref rid="fn445">19</xref></sup> It is simply that Caleb had taken his reward from the land, as stated (in Josh. 14:9): <small>SURELY THE LAND ON WHICH YOUR FOOT HAS TROD &#x003C;SHALL BE A PORTION FOR YOU AND YOUR DESCENDANTS FOREVER, BECAUSE YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE WISHES THE LORD MY GOD&#x003E;</small>. But Joshua [received the reward &#x003C;that would have gone to the&#x003E; ten spies, in that a <italic>yod</italic> &#x003C;which stands for&#x003E; ten was added to his name.

[Another interpretation:] When Moses saw that they were so very wicked, Moses said to him: May the Lord (abbreviated to <italic><small>YH</small></italic>) save (<italic><small>YWS</small>hY</italic>&#x2018;) you from this evil generation.<sup><xref rid="fn446">20</xref></sup></p>

<p>(Numb. 13:16:) <small>THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE MEN &#x003C;WHOM MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT THE LAND&#x003E;</small>.

Ishmael &#x003C;means&#x003E; &#x201C;God hears&#x201D;; Esau &#x003C;means&#x003E; &#x201C;He does the will of his maker.&#x201D; Moreover, their deeds were ugly. &#x003C;Those whose&#x003E; names are ugly but whose deeds are handsome are those coming up out of exile. (According to Ezra 2:53 &#x003D; Neh. 7:55): <small>THE CHILDREN OF</small> &#x007B;<small>BARKOM</small>&#x007D; [<small>BARKOS</small>], <small>THE CHILDREN OF SISERA</small> (cf. Jud. 4&#x2013;5), <small>THE CHILDREN OF TEMAH</small>. &#x003C;Those whose&#x003E; names are handsome and whose deeds are handsome are the tribes. &#x003C;Those whose&#x003E; names are ugly and whose deeds are ugly are the spies.

<p>(Numb. 13:17): <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO THEM: GO UP HERE INTO THE NEGEB</small>, [<small>AND GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY</small>]. &#x003C;They are&#x003E; a people who go up.<sup><xref rid="fn449">23</xref></sup> R.

Because they wore (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>NQ</small></italic>) the sun about the neck.<sup><xref rid="fn453">27</xref></sup> When the spies saw them they were afraid. Immediately they went and said (in vs. 31): <small>FOR THEY ARE STRONGER THAN WE</small>. Resh Laqish said: They struck against Heaven. Because of this transgression harsh decrees were issued against them. What does the Holy One say to Jeremiah? Go, say to them: You do not know what you have brought out from your mouth daily (according to Jer. 11:16): <small>A GREAT TUMULT</small>. They said (in Numb. 13:33): <small>&#x003C;MOREOVER THERE WE SAW THE NEPHILIM&#x2014;THE CHILDREN OF ANAK ARE PART OF THE NEPHILIM&#x2014;&#x003E; AND IN OUR OWN EYES WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS</small>. The Holy One said: I forgave them for that &#x003C;remark&#x003E;; but &#x003C;then&#x003E; (ibid., cont.) <small>AND SO WE WERE IN THEIR EYES</small>. Who would say that you were not like angels in there eyes? Do you know what I made you in their eyes? What have you brought upon yourselves? (Numb. 14:34:) <small>ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT YOU EXPLORED THE LAND, &#x003C;FORTY DAYS, EVERY DAY A YEAR&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small> As though this was not enough, they did not even enter the land. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world,<sup><xref rid="fn454">28</xref></sup> because the representatives (literally: those sent) were of flesh and blood, it has been decreed over them that they should not enter the land; but in the world to come I will suddenly send my angel (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>), and he shall clear a way before me. It is so stated (in Mal. 3:1): <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING</small> &#x007B;<small>A</small>&#x007D; [<small>MY</small>] <small>MESSENGER</small> (<italic>mal&#x2019;akh</italic>) <small>TO CLEAR A WAY BEFORE ME, AND &#x003C;THE LORD WHOM YOU SEEK&#x003E;</small> [<small>SHALL SUDDENLY COME UNTO HIS TEMPLE</small>].</p>
<title>4.12 Numbers 13:16ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:17:) <small>WHEN MOSES SENT THEM&#x2026;. &#x003C;THEN HE SAID UNTO THEM:</small>&#x003E; <small>GO UP HERE INTO THE NEGEB</small>. Why &#x003C;first&#x003E; <small>INTO THE NEGEB</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn455">29</xref></sup> Because this is what the &#x007B;drovers&#x007D; [merchants] do. They show the inferior goods first, and after that they show the best. (Vs. 18:) <small>AND YOU ARE TO SEE WHAT THE LAND IS LIKE</small>. Three times did Moses tell them: Look over the land of Israel (in vss: 18, 19, 20). There is land that raises strong men, and there is &#x003C;land&#x003E; that raises weaklings. There is also &#x003C;land&#x003E; that raises armies,<sup><xref rid="fn456">30</xref></sup> and there is &#x003C;land&#x003E; that diminishes armies. Thus did he charge them. (Numb. 13:18 &#x0026; 20:) <small>AS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN IT, ARE THEY MIGHTY &#x003C;OR&#x003E; WEAK</small>? <small>ARE THEY FEW OR MANY</small>? &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND WHAT OF THE LAND</small>? <small>IT IS FERTILE OR LEAN</small>? And how will you know about their strength? If they dwell in camps, they are mighty and depend upon their strength; but if they are in strongholds, they are weak and have fearful hearts. (Numb. 13:20:) <small>AND WHAT OF THE LAND</small>? <small>IT IS FERTILE OR LEAN</small>? &#x003C;How do we determine&#x003E; whether its fruits are light or fat. He said to them: Look at its stones and pebbles. If they are of flint, they are fat; and if they are of clay, they are lean. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOW THE TIME WAS THE TIME FOR THE FIRST-FRUITS OF THE GRAPES</small>. From here you learn that &#x003C;the month of&#x003E; Tammuz is never without figs and grapes.</p>
<title>4.13 Numbers 13:16ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:21:) <small>SO THEY WENT UP AND EXPLORED THE LAND</small>. How?<sup><xref rid="fn457">31</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; they entered a town, a pestilence afflicted the nobility; and the people of the town were busy with their burial So when they entered, no mortal saw them. For this reason they said (in vs. 32): <small>THE LAND THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED &#x2026; &#x003C;IS A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; It was through the &#x003C;very&#x003E; miracles which the Holy One did for them that they spread slander.</p>
<title>4.14 Numbers 13:16ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:22:) <small>NOW HEBRON WAS BUILT SEVEN YEARS &#x003C;BEFORE ZOAN IN EGYPT&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This verse is&#x003E; to make known the excellence of the land of Israel, that its worst soil is better than the land of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn458">32</xref></sup> Thus when the children of Noah inherited the world after the flood, they first built cities, but not in the best place. Instead they chose the worst of the land [of Israel, for Hebron is the worst &#x003C;place&#x003E; in the land of Israel.] But Zoan is the best which is in the land of Egypt, and this &#x003C;city of Hebron&#x003E; preceded it by seven years. If you should say: No, the one who built the former did not build the other, &#x003C;I can answer:&#x003E; It was the &#x003C;same&#x003E; generation; it was the &#x003C;same&#x003E; family (according to Gen. 10:6): <small>AND THE SONS OF HAM: CUSH, MIZRAIM, PUT, AND CANAAN</small>. Now they arose and built the one before the other. (Numb. 13:22:) <small>NOW HEBRON WAS BUILT SEVEN YEARS BEFORE ZOAN IN EGYPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn459">33</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.15 Numbers 13:16ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:23:) <small>THEN THEY CAME TO THE WADI ESHCOL</small>. They did not want to take any of the fruits from the land of Israel. If Caleb had not &#x007B;sent&#x007D; [extended &#x003C;his&#x003E; weapon, gone down in front of them, and said to them: If you do not take &#x003C;some&#x003E;, then either you kill me or I will kill you, they would not have taken &#x003C;anything&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn460">34</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (to Caleb in Josh. 14:9): <small>SURELY THE LAND ON WHICH YOUR FOOT HAS TROD SHALL BE A PORTION &#x003C;FOR YOU AND YOUR DESCENDANTS FOREVER,&#x003E; BECAUSE YOU HAVE FULFILLED THE WISHES OF THE LORD MY GOD</small>. (Numb. 13:23:) <small>AND THEY BORE IT BY POLE WITH TWO</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn461">35</xref></sup> There were not less than two poles, since it does not say: &#x201C;Two on a pole,&#x201D; but <small>&#x003C;BY POLE&#x003E; WITH TWO</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn462">36</xref></sup> Some also say three: <small>BY POLE</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; one &#x003C;plus&#x003E; <small>WITH TWO</small> for a total of three. And how heavy a load did each and every one have in hand? Go out and learn from the stones that they took from the Jordan, as stated (in Josh. 4:20): <small>AND</small> [<small>JOSHUA SET UP IN GILGAL THOSE</small>] &#x007B;<small>TEN</small>&#x007D; [<small>TWELVE</small>] <small>STONES</small> [<small>WHICH THEY TOOK FROM THE JORDAN</small>]. What was the size of each and every one of them. A load of forty <italic>seah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn463">37</xref></sup> From here you can calculate that cluster of grapes. A person carries and lifts up &#x003C;one&#x003E; <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> by himself. With his companion lifting &#x003C;the load&#x003E; up upon him, he carries two <italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn464">38</xref></sup> Together with his companion he carries three <italic>&#x003C;se&#x2019;ah&#x003E;.</italic> Ergo one calculates from here (the weight of the cluster).</p>
<p>(Numb. 13:25:) <small>AT THE END OF FORTY DAYS THEN THEY RETURNED FROM EXPLORING THE LAND</small>. But do you not find that they went from south to north?<sup><xref rid="fn465">39</xref></sup> Moreover, would they have walked the whole &#x003C;land&#x003E; in forty days? It is simply that it was revealed to the Holy One that they would come and utter slander, and that there would be decreed against that generation years of suffering (according to Numb. 14:34): [<small>EVERY</small>] <small>DAY A YEAR, YOU SHALL BEAR YOUR INIQUITIES FORTY YEARS</small>. So the Holy One caused their road to shrink (i.e., to close up) before them.</p>
<title>4.16 Numbers 13:16ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:24:) <small>THAT PLACE WAS CALLED WADI ESHCOL</small>. This text is related (to Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>, [<small>AND FROM OF OLD, THINGS THAT HAVE NOT YET HAPPENED</small>], in that everything is foreseen by the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn466">40</xref></sup> Eshcol (according to Gen. 14:24) was Abraham&#x2019;s friend, and he was called Eshcol because of the grape cluster (<italic>eshkol</italic>), which Israel was going to cut from his place in his name.</p>
<title>4.17 Numbers 13:16ff, Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:26-28) <small>THEN THEY WENT AND CAME &#x003C;UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON&#x003E;&#x2026;. AND THEY RECOUNTED TO HIM AND SAID: WE CAME &#x003C;UNTO THE LAND&#x003E;&#x2026;. HOWEVER &#x003C;THE PEOPLE WHO DWELL IN THE LAND&#x003E; ARE STRONG&#x2026;</small>. Such is the way of those who recount slander.<sup><xref rid="fn467">41</xref></sup> They open with what is good and finish with what is ill.</p>
<title>4.18 Numbers 13:16ff, Part X</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:29:) <small>AMALEK DWELLS &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF THE NEGEB&#x003E;</small>. What &#x003C;reason&#x003E; did they see for opening with Amalek?<sup><xref rid="fn468">42</xref></sup> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a child who misbehaves and is beaten with a strap. When they wanted to intimidate him, they reminded him of the strap. Similarly Amalek had been an evil strap for Israel. What &#x003C;reason&#x003E; did he see to post himself &#x007B;up to&#x007D; in the way &#x003C;of Israel&#x003E;? &#x003C;He did so&#x003E; because his ancestor, Esau, had so commanded him in order to forestall them in their way. So he uprooted &#x003C;himself&#x003E; from his place and posted himself on the road. &#x007B;(Numb. 14:45:) <small>AND THERE WENT DOWN THE AMALEKITE, WHILE THE CANAANITE, WHO DWELT IN THAT MOUNTAIN</small>.&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn469">43</xref></sup> [(Numb. 13:29, cont.:) <small>WHILE THE HITTITE, THE JEBUSITE, AND THE AMORITE DWELL IN THE MOUNTAINS</small>,] <small>AND THE CANAANITE DWELLS BY THE SEA AND ALONG THE JORDAN</small>. These are the mighty ones dwelling on the way. Therefore the spies intended to break the heart of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 32:9): <small>THEY TURNED AWAY THE HEART OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>4.19 Numbers 13:16ff, Part XI</title>
<p>(Numb. 13:30:) <small>THEN CALEB HUSHED &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES&#x003E;</small>&#x2026;, when at first he said to them: I am of the same opinion as you; but his heart was for speaking the truth, as stated (in Josh. 14:7): <small>AND I BROUGHT HIM BACK WORD ACCORDING TO WHAT WAS IN MY HEART</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn470">44</xref></sup> The Holy One also testifies over him, as stated (in Numb. 14:24): <small>BUT MY SERVANT CALEB</small>, [<small>BECAUSE HE HAD ANOTHER SPIRIT WITH HIM</small>]. So when the spies came, they said: We can trust Caleb? Immediately he stood up on a stool<sup><xref rid="fn471">45</xref></sup> and had all Israel become silent, because they had been clamoring against Moses, as stated (in Numb. 13:30): <small>THEN CALEB HUSHED THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES</small>. Now they were thinking that he would utter slander. For that reason they were silent. He began by saying (ibid., cont.): <small>WE SHOULD CERTAINLY GO UP AND POSSESS IT</small>. Immediately they took issue with him and said (in Numb. 13:31&#x2013;32): <small>WE ARE UNABLE TO GO UP &#x003C;AGAINST THIS PEOPLE&#x003E;&#x2026;. SO THEY SPREAD CALUMNY ABOUT THE LAND&#x2026;.</small></p>
<title>4.20 Numbers 13:16ff, Part XII</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:1:) <small>THEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION RAISED &#x003C;THEIR VOICE AND CRIED&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:8): <small>THE WORDS OF A MURMURER ARE LIKE MIGHTY BLOWS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn472">46</xref></sup> Those words which they murmured against the Holy One brought them misfortune for generations.<sup><xref rid="fn473">47</xref></sup> Thus if they had not become like the spies, they would not have been punished with them. Instead they acquiesced with them, as stated (in Deut. 1:27): <small>YOU MURMURED IN YOUR TENTS</small>&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4.21 Numbers 13:16ff, Part XIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:1:) <small>THEN THE WHOLE CONGREGATION RAISED THEIR VOICE AND CRIED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTN</small></italic>); <small>&#x003C;AND THAT NIGHT THE PEOPLE WEPT</small>.&#x003E; This text is related (to Jer. 12:8): <small>&#x003C;MY HERITAGE&#x003E; HAS SET</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTN</small></italic>) <small>ITS VOICE AGAINST ME; &#x003C;THEREFORE I HAVE HATED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SN</small></italic>&#x2019;) <small>IT</small>.&#x003E; The very voice with which you wept caused you to be punished like enemies (rt.: <italic><small>SN</small></italic>&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn474">48</xref></sup> Moreover, it was over this very generation that Isaiah said (in Is. 17:11): <small>IN THE DAY YOU PLANT, YOU SEE IT FLOURISH; AND ON THE MORNING YOU SOW, YOU SEE IT BLOOM; &#x003C;BUT THE&#x003E; HARVEST FLEES ON A DAY OF SICKNESS</small> (<italic>nahalah</italic>) <small>AND HUMAN PAIN</small>. On the day that I went to give you your ancestral inheritance (<italic>nahalah</italic>) you became a manifesto in the world. <small>AND HUMAN PAIN</small> refers to the divine punishment that you received as a legacy for &#x003C;future&#x003E; generations.<sup><xref rid="fn475">49</xref></sup> Because the congregation wept in the night of the ninth of Ab,<sup><xref rid="fn476">50</xref></sup> the Holy One has said: You have wept for nothing. I shall establish this night for you as &#x003C;a night of&#x003E; a weeping for &#x003C;future&#x003E; generations, and from that hour a decree on the Temple was ordained for it to be destroyed and that the children of Israel would go in exile among the nations. It is so stated (in Ps. 106:26&#x2013;27): <small>SO HE RAISED HIS HAND TOWARD THEM &#x003C;IN AN OATH&#x003E;</small>, [<small>TO MAKE THEM FALL IN THE WILDERNESS AND TO MAKE THEIR SEED FALL AMONG THE GENTILES, EVEN TO SCATTER THEM AMONG THE LANDS</small>]. The raising of &#x003C;the divine&#x003E; hand was corresponding to the lifting up of the voice (in Numb. 14:1).</p>
<title>4.22 Numbers 13:16ff, Part XIV</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:2:) <small>AND ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MURMURED AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON; AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION SAID TO HIM</small> (<italic>sic</italic>): <small>WOULD THAT WE HAD DIED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a king at whose tribunal<sup><xref rid="fn477">51</xref></sup> a certain person came up for judgment.<sup><xref rid="fn478">52</xref></sup> He uttered a word from his mouth by which he convicted himself. The king set aside his bill of indictment<sup><xref rid="fn479">53</xref></sup> and convicted him out of his own mouth. He said to him: I am judging you by what has come out of your own mouth. So let it be for you according to what you have said. Similarly the Holy One said to them (in Numb. 14:29): <small>IN THIS DESERT SHALL YOUR CARCASSES FALL</small>. They began to say (in Numb. 14:3&#x2013;9): <small>AND WHY IS THE LORD BRINGING US &#x003C;UNTO THIS LAND&#x003E; &#x2026;? THEY ALSO SAID TO EACH OTHER: LET US APPOINT A LEADER AND RETURN TO EGYPT. THEN MOSES AND AARON FELL ON THEIR FACES &#x003C; BEFORE THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;. MOREOVER, JOSHUA BEN NUN AND CALEB BEN JEPHUNNEH, OF THOSE WHO HAD EXPLORED THE LAND, RENT THEIR CLOTHES AND SPOKE UNTO THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING:&#x2026;. IF THE LORD IS PLEASED WITH US, &#x003C;HE WILL BRING US INTO THIS LAND&#x003E;&#x2026;. ONLY DO NOT REBEL AGAINST THE LORD&#x2026;</small>. The people said to them: Do you have no faith in us? Our brothers care for us more than you do. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 1:28): <small>WHERE ARE WE GOING UP TO</small>? <small>OUR BROTHERS HAVE CAUSED OUR HEARTS TO MELT</small> (with fear). (Numb. 14:10): <small>SO THE WHOLE CONGREGATION SAID TO STONE THEM WITH STONES</small>. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN THE GLORY OF THE LORD APPEARED IN THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. &#x003C;This incident&#x003E; teaches that they threw stones,<sup><xref rid="fn480">54</xref></sup> but the cloud received them.</p>

The Holy One said: I have uttered two cries (of &#x2018;<italic><small>AD-&#x2019;ANAH</small></italic>) because of you.<sup><xref rid="fn481">55</xref></sup> Your end shall be to cry out four times in subjection to empires. (Ps. 13:2&#x2013;3[1&#x2013;2]:) <small>HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad-&#x2019;anah</italic>), <small>O LORD</small>? <small>WILL YOU FORGET ME FOREVER</small>? <small>HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad&#x2019;-&#x2019;anah</italic>)&#x007B;, <small>O LORD</small>,&#x007D; <small>WILL YOU HIDE YOUR FACE FROM ME</small>? <small>HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad-&#x2019;anah</italic>) <small>SHALL I TAKE COUNSEL IN MY SOUL WITH GRIEF IN MY HEART ALL DAY</small>? <small>HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad-&#x2019;anah</italic>) <small>WILL MY ENEMY BE EXALTED OVER ME</small>? (Numb. 14:27:) <small>I CRIED OUT: HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad-matay</italic>) <small>SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>? Your end shall be to cry out (in Ps. 6:4[3]): <small>MY SOUL ALSO IS GREATLY DISMAYED; AND YOU, O LORD, HOW LONG</small> (<italic>&#x2018;ad-matay</italic>)?</p>
<title>4.24 Numbers 14:11, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:12:) <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small> &#x2026;. Moses said: Sovereign of the World, look at the covenant with their ancestors, to whom you swore that you would raise up from them kings, prophets, and priests&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn482">56</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: But are you not one of their children? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A NATION THAT IS GREATER</small> [<small>AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN THEY</small>]. When Moses saw &#x003C;how things were&#x003E;, he took a different course (in Numb. 14:13&#x2013;14). <small>BUT MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD: WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HEAR &#x003C;WHAT HAPPENED&#x003E; &#x2026;, THEY WILL SAY UNTO THE INHABITANTS OF &#x003C;THIS&#x003E; LAND</small>. They will say: He had no power to sustain them.<sup><xref rid="fn483">57</xref></sup> He said to him: But have they not seen the miracles and the mighty deeds which I did for them by the sea? So how will they say (in Numb. 14:16): &#x003C;I<small>T MUST BE BECAUSE&#x003E; THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE &#x003C;TO BRING THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND&#x003E;</small>? They will say: He was able to stand against Pharaoh, &#x003C;but&#x003E; he was not able to stand against thirty one kings.<sup><xref rid="fn484">58</xref></sup> [Sovereign of the whole universe, act on your own behalf.] (Numb. 14:17:) <small>SO NOW PLEASE LET THE POWER OF THE LORD INCREASE</small>, and let the principle of mercy overcome the principle of justice, (ibid., cont:) <small>AS YOU HAVE PROMISED, SAYING</small>. I said to you: With what principle do you judge your world? (Exod. 33:13:) <small>PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAYS KNOWN TO ME</small>. So you removed (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) [the principle of justice] from me (according to Exod. 34:6): <small>AND THE LORD PASSED BY</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) [<small>BEFORE</small>] <small>HIM, &#x003C;AND PROCLAIMED: THE LORD, THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. That principle of which you told me &#x003C;still&#x003E; exists, (according to Numb. 14:17): <small>PLEASE LET THE POWER OF THE LORD INCREASE&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One accepted his words and thanked him. (Numb. 14:20:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>.</p>
<title>4.25 Numbers 14:23ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:23:) <small>SURELY THEY</small> [<small>SHALL NOT SEE THE LAND WHICH I PROMISED ON OATH TO THEIR ANCESTORS</small>. It is also written (in Numb. 32:11): <small>SURELY NONE OF</small>] <small>THE PEOPLE WHO CAME UP FROM EGYPT, FROM TWENTY YEARS OLD</small> [<small>AND UP, SHALL SEE</small>] <small>&#x003C;THE LAND WHICH I PROMISED ON OATH TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn485">59</xref></sup> Whether one was in agreement or was not in agreement (with the spies), he did not<sup><xref rid="fn486">60</xref></sup> enter &#x003C;the promised land&#x003E;. Of the people who came up from Egypt, if one had gotten two &#x003C;pubic&#x003E; hairs but was less than twenty,<sup><xref rid="fn487">61</xref></sup> if he was in agreement with them, he did not enter &#x003C;the land&#x003E;. But nonetheless, not one of them died at less than sixty.<sup><xref rid="fn488">62</xref></sup> Come and see the difference between righteous and wicked, [even as it is stated (in Mal. 3:18): <small>THEN YOU SHALL AGAIN SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHTEOUS AND WICKED</small>.] It is comparable to a certain matron<sup><xref rid="fn489">63</xref></sup> who had an [Ethiopian] bondmaid. Now her husband went to a country overseas. All night the bondmaid said to the matron: [I am fairer than you and the king loves me more than you. That matron said to her:] When the morning comes, we shall know who [is fairer and whom] the king loves. Similarly do the nations of the world say to Israel: As for us, our deeds are more beautiful, and in us does the Holy One delight. Therefore &#x007B;Isaiah&#x007D; [Israel] has said: When the morning comes we shall know in whom the Holy One delights, as stated (in Is. 21:12): <small>THE WATCHMAN SAID: THE MORNING COMES</small>. When the world to come arrives, which is called morning,<sup><xref rid="fn490">64</xref></sup> <small>THEN</small> (according to Mal. 3:18) <small>YOU SHALL AGAIN SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHTEOUS AND WICKED</small>.</p>
<p>It is written (in Ps. 62:10 [9]): <small>HUMANS ARE MERE VANITY</small>. R Hiyya<sup><xref rid="fn491">65</xref></sup> said in the name of R. Levi: All vanities which Israel does all the days of the year are (ibid., cont.:) <small>TO GO UP</small> (i.e., vanish) <small>ON THE SCALES</small> (<italic>mozenayim</italic>). The Holy One pardons them in the constellation Libra (<italic>mozenayim</italic>), in the month of Tishri, as stated (in Lev. 16:30): <small>FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU &#x003C;TO CLEANSE YOU&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>4.26 Numbers 15:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:1&#x2013;2:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&#x003E;: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many things is a father obligated to do for a son?<sup><xref rid="fn492">66</xref></sup> [Thus have our masters taught:] A father is obligated to do five things for a son: to circumcise him, to teach him Torah, to redeem him according to the redemption of the first-born, to teach him commandments, and to take a wife for him.<sup><xref rid="fn493">67</xref></sup> The father is the Holy One. Just as a &#x003C;human&#x003E; father is obligated to his son, so does the Holy One do for Israel. The &#x003C;human&#x003E; father is obligated to circumcise his son. Similarly the Holy One circumcised Israel at the hands of Joshua (according to Josh. 5:2): <small>AND AGAIN CIRCUMCISE</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL A SECOND TIME</small>. The father is obligated to redeem his son. Similarly the Holy One did so for Israel. He redeemed them, as stated (in I Chron. 17:21): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>WHO IS LIKE YOUR PEOPLE ISRAEL, A UNIQUE NATION ON EARTH</small>, [<small>WHOM GOD WENT TO REDEEM AS A PEOPLE FOR HIMSELF</small>]. &#x003C;The father is obligated&#x003E; to teach him Torah, &#x007B;The Holy One taught Torah to Israel.&#x007D; as stated (in Deut. 11:19): <small>AND YOU SHALL TEACH THEM TO YOUR CHILDREN BY TALKING ABOUT THEM</small>. [And the Holy One taught Torah to Israel, as stated] (in Is. 48:17): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, TEACHING YOU FOR YOUR OWN GOOD</small>. &#x003C;The father is obligated&#x003E; to teach him commandments. The Holy One taught the commandments to Israel (in Lev. 27:34): <small>THESE ARE THE COMMANDMENTS WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED &#x003C;MOSES&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Regarding marriage,&#x003E; the Holy One said to Israel (in Gen. 1:28): <small>BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY</small>. Moreover, just as the father wills his property to his son, and &#x003C;as&#x003E; his son also is obligated to offer him a gift<sup><xref rid="fn494">68</xref></sup>; so also did the Holy One say to Israel (in Numb. 15:2&#x2013;3): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>YOU SHALL MAKE</small><sup><xref rid="fn495">69</xref></sup> &#x007B;<small>A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING</small>&#x007D; [<small>A BURNT OFFERING</small>] <small>TO THE LORD</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>&#x003C;TO MAKE&#x003E; A PLEASING ODOR &#x003C;TO THE LORD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn496">70</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.27 Numbers 15:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>R. Tanhuma bar Abba opened &#x003C;his discourse&#x003E; in the name of R. Hanina the father of R. Aha bar Hanina &#x003C;as follows&#x003E;:<sup><xref rid="fn497">71</xref></sup> This parashah concerns libations. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 15:6&#x2013;7): <small>OR FOR A RAM YOU SHALL MAKE A MEAL OFFERING</small> [&#x2026;;] <small>AND FOR THE OBLATION &#x003C;YOU SHALL OFFER&#x003E;</small> a &#x007B;<small>HALF</small>&#x007D; [<small>THIRD</small>] <small>OF A HIN OF WINE</small>. From here on, in regard to the hallah (according to vss 19&#x2013;20): <small>AND IT SHALL BE THAT, WHEN YOU EAT FROM THE BREAD OF THE LAND, &#x003C;YOU SHALL SET ASIDE AN OFFERING FOR THE LORD&#x003E;. OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL SET ASIDE A LOAF</small> (<italic>hallah</italic>) <small>AS AN OFFERING&#x2026;</small>. Thus <italic>hallah</italic> &#x003C;is mentioned&#x003E; last, and libations first. For this reason R. Hanina opened (with Eccl. 9:7): <small>GO, EAT YOUR BREAD WITH GLADNESS, &#x003C;AND DRINK YOUR WINE WITH A JOYFUL HEART&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn498">72</xref></sup> In reference to what does the verse speak? With reference to Abraham, when the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:2): <small>PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON</small>. Abraham rose early, took him promptly, led him on, and brought him up to Mount Moriah. [The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:12): <small>DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD</small>.] Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, did you tell me (in vs. 2): <small>PLEASE TAKE</small>, for no reason? He said to him: No&#x0021; Rather &#x003C;it was&#x003E; to make you known in the world. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 18:19): <small>FOR I HAVE MADE HIM KNOWN</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn499">73</xref></sup> <small>SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &#x003C;HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> R. Simeon ben Johay said: The Holy One said to him: By your life, I ascribe &#x003C;your obedience&#x003E; to you &#x003C;as proof&#x003E; that, if I had told you to take your own life, you would not have refrained &#x003C;from doing so&#x003E; for the sake of my name and would have obeyed &#x003C;the command&#x003E; to kill for the sake of my name. Where is it shown? R. Simeon ben Johay said: The Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:16): <small>AND YOU HAVE NOT WITHHELD YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY ONE</small>. See, <small>&#x003C;YOUR SON&#x003E;</small> has already specified Isaac. &#x003C;So&#x003E; what is the meaning of <small>YOUR ONLY ONE</small>? Simply Abraham&#x2019;s life. Thus the soul is called <small>ONLY ONE</small>, where it is stated (in Ps. 22:21 [20]): <small>DELIVER MY LIFE FROM THE SWORD, MY ONLY ONE FROM THE POWER OF THE DOG</small>. Abraham said to the Holy One: Is it possible for me to go from here with no sacrifice? The Holy One said to Abraham: Here is your sacrifice. &#x003C;It has been&#x003E; prepared for you from the six days of creation. (According to Gen. 22:13): <small>THEN ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES TO LOOK, AND THERE WAS A RAM&#x2026;. SO HE OFFERED IT UP AS A BURNT OFFERING IN PLACE OF HIS SON</small>. At that time Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World: I am not moving from here until you swear to me that you will never test me again; for if, heaven forbid, I had not obeyed you, I should have destroyed whatever I had accomplished during my lifetime. R. Hanan said: The Holy One said to him: By your life, so it shall be; for if you had not obeyed me, you would have possessed nothing. At that time the Holy One swore to him that he would never test him again. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 22:16): <small>AND HE SAID: I BY MYSELF HAVE SWORN, SAYS THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to him: By your life severe afflictions and other trials had been designated to come upon you, but now they shall not come. These were the same afflictions which came upon Job.<sup><xref rid="fn500">74</xref></sup> They had been designated to come upon Abraham, for the following has been joined to the parashah (in Gen. 22:20&#x2013;21): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS, THAT IT WAS TOLD TO ABRAHAM: &#x003C;BEHOLD MILCAH, SHE ALSO HAS BORNE SONS TO YOUR BROTHER NAHOR:&#x003E; UZ HIS FIRST-BORN&#x2026;</small>. And this is Job, according to what is stated (in Job 1:1): <small>THERE WAS A MAN IN THE LAND BELONGING TO UZ</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn501">75</xref></sup> [<small>HIS</small> (i.e., <small>U</small>z&#x2019;s) <small>NAME WAS JOB</small>. The Holy One said to Abraham (in Eccl. 9:7): <small>GO, EAT YOUR BREAD WITH GLADNESS, &#x003C;AND DRINK YOUR WINE WITH A JOYFUL HEART, &#x003E; FOR GOD HAS ALREADY APPROVED YOUR WORKS</small>.</p>
<title>4.28 Numbers 15:37ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:37&#x2013;38:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND TELL THEM TO MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 97:11): <small>LIGHT IS SOWN FOR THE RIGHTEOUS, AND GLADNESS FOR THOSE WITH AN UPRIGHT HEART</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn502">76</xref></sup> It also says (in Is. 42:21): <small>THE LORD WAS DELIGHTED BECAUSE OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS, TO MAGNIFY AND GLORIFY TORAH</small>. The Holy One sowed the Torah and the commandments for Israel, in order to bequeath them life in the world to come. He did not put a thing in the world concerning which he did not give Israel a commandment. Did &#x003C;an Israelite&#x003E; go out to plow? &#x003C;There is&#x003E; (Deut. 22:10): <small>YOU SHALL NOT PLOW WITH AN OX AND AN ASS TOGETHER</small>. To sow? &#x003C;There is&#x003E; (Deut. 22:9): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SOW YOUR VINEYARD WITH TWO KINDS OF SEED</small>. To reap? &#x003C;There is&#x003E; (Deut. 24:19): <small>WHEN YOU REAP YOUR HARVEST IN YOUR FIELD &#x003C;AND HAVE FORGOTTEN A SHEAF IN THE FIELD, YOU SHALL NOT RETURN TO TAKE IT;&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;.] Did &#x003C;an Israelite&#x003E; knead? &#x003C;There is&#x003E; (Numb. 15:20): <small>OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL SET ASIDE A LOAF</small> (<italic>hallah</italic>) <small>AS AN OFFERING</small>. Did &#x003C;an Israelite&#x003E; butcher? &#x003C;There is&#x003E; (Deut. 18:3): <small>THAT ONE SHALL GIVE THE PRIEST THE SHOULDER, THE TWO CHEEKS, AND THE STOMACH</small>. With respect to a bird&#x2019;s nest, the driving away of the mother bird, &#x003C;there is Deut. 22:6&#x2013;7&#x003E;. Concerning animals and fowl, &#x003C;there is&#x003E; (Lev. 17:13): <small>HE SHALL POUR OUT ITS BLOOD AND COVER IT WITH DUST</small>. Did he plant? (Lev. 19:23:) <small>&#x003C;MOREOVER, WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND&#x003E;</small> [<small>AND PLANT ANY TREE FOR FOOD</small>,] <small>YOU SHALL COUNT &#x003C;ITS FRUIT&#x003E; AS FORBIDDEN</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; Did he bury the dead? (Deut. 14:1:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT CUT YOURSELVES</small>. Did one shave hair? (Lev. 19:27:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT ROUND OFF THE SIDEBURNS ON YOUR HEAD</small>. Did he build a house? (Deut. 22:8:) <small>&#x003C;WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW HOUSE,&#x003E; YOU SHALL MAKE A PARAPET &#x003C;FOR YOUR ROOF&#x003E;</small>. (Also Deut. 6:9:) <small>AND YOU SHALL WRITE THEM UPON THE DOORPOSTS</small> (<italic>mezuzot</italic>) <small>OF YOUR HOUSE &#x003C;AND ON YOUR GATES</small>. Did he wrap himself in a cloak (<italic>tallit</italic>)? (Numb. 15:38:) <small>THAT THEY MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES</small>.</p>
<title>4.29 Numbers 15:37ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 15:38:) <small>THAT THEY MAKE &#x003C;TASSELS&#x003E; FOR THEMSELVES</small>.] When you make them, they shall not be from &#x003C;something already&#x003E; made. Thus one must not extract threads<sup><xref rid="fn503">77</xref></sup> from the cloak &#x003C;itself&#x003E; and make &#x003C;tassels&#x003E; from them. Rather &#x003C;it is&#x003E; a command to get &#x003C;fresh&#x003E; white and blue threads to make them.<sup><xref rid="fn504">78</xref></sup> When &#x003C;did this rule apply&#x003E;? When there was &#x003C;a real&#x003E; blue, but now we only have white, because the blue has been hidden. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ON THE CORNERS OF &#x003C;THEIR GARMENTS&#x003E;:</small> Not in the middle, but on the corner. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>A TWISTED THREAD</small> (<italic>petil</italic>). Thus it is necessary to twist (<italic>petol</italic>) them. R. Meir said: Why does blue differ from all &#x003C;other&#x003E; kinds of colors? Because blue resembles [the sea, the sea resembles] the firmament, and the firmament resembles the throne of glory. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 24:10): <small>AND THEY SAW THE GOD OF ISRAEL, AND UNDER HIS FEET THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE BRICKWORK OF SAPPHIRE, LIKE THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES FOR BRIGHTNESS</small>.</p>
<title>4.30 Numbers 15:37ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:39:) <small>SO IT SHALL BE A TASSEL FOR YOU THAT YOU MAY SEE IT &#x003C;AND REMEMBER ALL THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Thus it should be visible. And what is its size? Bet Shammay says four fingers, while Bet Hillel says three.<sup><xref rid="fn505">79</xref></sup> (Ibid.:) <small>THAT YOU MAY SEE IT</small>. &#x003C;There is&#x003E; exception for a garment &#x003C;worn&#x003E; at night.<sup><xref rid="fn506">80</xref></sup> Are you saying: For a garment &#x003C;worn&#x003E; at night? Or is &#x003C;the exception&#x003E; only for a garment of a blind person? Hence, it says again (in vs. 40): <small>SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER &#x003C;AND PERFORM ALL MY COMMANDMENTS&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Hence, it ordains seeing, and it ordains remembering: remembering for the one who does not see and seeing for the one who does see. (vs. 39:) <small>THAT YOU MAY SEE IT</small>. <small>IT</small> (here) is masculine and not feminine.<sup><xref rid="fn507">81</xref></sup> When Israel looks at that &#x003C;feminine&#x003E; tassel of blue, it will seem to them as though the Divine Presence is dwelling among them.<sup><xref rid="fn508">82</xref></sup> (Vss. 39&#x2013;40:) <small>THAT YOU MAY SEE&#x2026;. SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER</small>. The seeing leads to remembering &#x003C;the commandments&#x003E;, and remembering leads to performing &#x003C;them&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in vs. 40): <small>SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND PERFORM &#x003C;ALL MY COMMANDMENTS&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; Why? (Deut. 32:47): <small>BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TRIFLING THING FOR YOU</small>.</p>
<title>4.31 Numbers 15:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:39:) <small>AND YOU SHALL NOT GO ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN HEART</small> [<small>AND YOUR OWN EYES THROUGH WHICH YOU LUST</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ZNH</small></italic>)]. The heart and the eyes are procurers for the body, in that they prostitute (rt.: <italic><small>ZNH</small></italic>) the body.<sup><xref rid="fn509">83</xref></sup> [(vs. 40:) <small>SO THAT YOU MAY REMEMBER AND PERFORM ALL MY COMMANDMENTS:</small> &#x003C;The situation&#x003E; is comparable to a certain person who was thrown into the midst of the water. The helmsman<sup><xref rid="fn510">84</xref></sup> extended a rope to him. He said to him: Grab this rope with your hand, and do not let go of it; for if you do let go of it, you will lose your life. So also did the Holy One say to Israel. As long as you adhere to the commandments, &#x003C;the following holds true&#x003E; (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. And so it says (in Prov. 4:13): <small>HOLD ONTO DISCIPLINE; DO NOT SLACK OFF. KEEP IT FOR, IT IS YOUR LIFE</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 15:40, cont.:) <small>AND THAT YOU MAY BE HOLY</small>. When you perform the commandments, you are made holy, and fear of you &#x003C;comes&#x003E; over the nations. &#x003C;If&#x003E; you withdraw from the Torah, you become profaned. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world because of the evil drive, you withdraw from the commandments; in the age to come I am rooting it out of you. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 36:26&#x2013;27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU. THEN I WILL MAKE YOU WALK IN MY STATUTES; AND YOU WILL OBSERVE MY ORDINANCES BY PERFORMING THEM</small>.</p>

<title>Appendix to Chapter 4 Numbers, Parashah IVa: Supplement to <italic>Shelah</italic></title>
<title>4a. 1 Numbers 14:11ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:11:)<sup><xref rid="fn511">1</xref></sup> <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME, AND HOW LONG WILL THEY HAVE NO FAITH IN ME</small> &#x2026;? This text is related (to Prov. 1:25, 30): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN AND WOULD NOT ACCEPT MY REBUKE</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>THEY HAVE DESPISED ALL MY REBUKE</small>. What is the implication of <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>? Simply that all the good which I planned for you, you have spoiled and spurned.<sup><xref rid="fn512">2</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PR</small></italic>&#x2018;) <small>ALL MY PLAN</small>? At the beginning I said to Moses (in Exod. 3:8): <small>I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM OUT OF THE HAND OF THE EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM UP &#x003C;OUT OF THAT LAND UNTO A GOOD AND SPACIOUS LAND&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> But you did not act in the way &#x003C;I intended&#x003E;. Instead you came to the sea and immediately spoiled my plan, as stated (in Ps. 106:7): <small>THEY REBELLED AT THE SEA, AT THE REED SEA</small>. When you came to Mount Sinai, I descended and spoke with you. I brought down on your behalf thousands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads of angels, and I passed on two angels to each and every person in Israel. R. Johanan said: One to gird him with his weapons<sup><xref rid="fn513">3</xref></sup> and one to put a crown on his head.<sup><xref rid="fn514">4</xref></sup> R. Huna of Sepphoris said: He bound their weapons to them, while R. Simoy said: He clothed them in purple, as stated (in Ezek. 16:10): <small>I CLOTHED YOU WITH EMBROIDERED GARMENTS</small>. R. Simeon b. Johay says: He clothed them with an instrument of weaponry with the Ineffable Name written upon it. Moreover, as long as it was in their hand, nothing evil had power against them, neither the angel of death nor anything else.<sup><xref rid="fn515">5</xref></sup> But when they sinned, Moses had said to them (in Exod. 33:5): <small>NOW THEN, REMOVE YOUR ORNAMENTS</small> (i.e., your weapons) <small>FROM YOURSELVES, THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO TO YOU</small>. At that time (according to vs. 4): <small>WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS BAD NEWS, THEY WENT INTO MOURNING, &#x003C;AND NO ONE PUT HIS ORNAMENTS ON HIMSELF&#x003E;</small>. And what is written (in vs. 6)? <small>SO</small> [<small>THE CHILDREN OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF ORNAMENTS&#x2026;</small>. What had the Holy One done (at the giving of Torah)?<sup><xref rid="fn516">6</xref></sup> He had brought the angel of death and said to him: All the world is under your authority, except this people whom I have chosen for myself. R. Eleazar the Son of R. Jose the Galilean said: The angel of death said to the Holy One: Have I been created in the world for nothing?<sup><xref rid="fn517">7</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him: I created you so that you would destroy &#x003C;all&#x003E; the peoples of the world except this people, over whom you have no authority to take a single one of them. Look at the plan which the Holy One had devised concerning them for them to live and endure&#x0021; Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. So also it says (in Exod. 32:16): <small>AND THE WRITING WAS THE WRITING OF GOD INSCRIBED</small> (<italic>harut</italic>) <small>ON THE TABLETS</small>. What is the meaning of <italic>harut?</italic> R. Judah says: <small>FREEDOM</small> (<italic>herut</italic>) from the empires; but R. Nehemiah says: <small>FREEDOM</small> (<italic>herut</italic>) from the angel of death; and our masters say: <small>FREEDOM</small> from afflictions. Look at the plan which the Holy One had devised for them&#x0021; Then they immediately spoiled this plan after &#x003C;only&#x003E; forty days. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 1:25): <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>.</p>
<title>4a.2 Numbers 14:11ff, Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: The Holy One said to them: I had said that you would not sin. Instead you would live and endure like me, just as I live and endure forever and forevermore. (According to Ps. 82:6:) <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS; EVEN ALL OF YOU ARE CHILDREN OF THE MOST HIGH</small>. &#x003C;You are&#x003E; like the ministering angels who never taste death. Yet after this greatness you wanted to die (according to vs. 7): <small>INDEED YOU SHALL DIE LIKE A HUMAN</small> (<italic>Adam</italic>), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; like the first Adam, to whom I decreed one commandment which he was to do, that he might live and endure forever, as stated (in Gen. 3:22): <small>BEHOLD, THE HUMAN</small> (<italic>adam</italic>) <small>HAS BECOME LIKE ONE OF US</small>. Similarly also (in Gen. 1:27): <small>AND GOD CREATED THE HUMAN</small> (<italic>adam</italic>) <small>IN HIS OWN IMAGE</small>, so that he would live and endure like himself. Yet he corrupted his works and nullified his decree, for he ate of the tree. Then I said to him (in Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. So also in your case (in Ps. 82:6), <small>I SAID: YOU ARE GODS</small>, but you corrupted your works as &#x003C;did&#x003E; Adam. Surely you shall die like Adam&#x0021; And who made this happen to them? &#x003C;You, for&#x003E; (according to Prov. 1:25) <small>BUT YOU HAVE SPURNED ALL MY PLAN</small>. (According to vs. 30:) <small>THEY HAVE DESPISED ALL MY REBUKE</small>. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small> &#x2026;?</p>
<title>4a.3 Numbers 14:11ff, Part III</title>
<p>[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: This text is related (to Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR IT</small>? <small>WHEN I HOPED FOR IT TO PRODUCE GRAPES, WHY DID IT PRODUCE SOUR GRAPES</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn518">8</xref></sup> The Holy One said: &#x003C;Consider&#x003E; what good things I have created within my world&#x0021; Did I not make them for you? Yet with the very good that I made for you, you provoked me. I brought you out of Egypt. Then when I came to the sea, I made it as if it were full of clay.<sup><xref rid="fn519">9</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Hab. 3:15): <small>YOU TROD THE SEA WITH YOUR HORSES, THE MORTAR OF MANY WATERS</small>. They walked in it and talked to each other. A certain Reubenite said: Where are we? Do you not know that he has brought us away from clay and bricks and returned us to clay? Thus it is stated (in Exod. 1:14): <small>AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER WITH HARD LABOR AT MORTAR AND BRICKS</small>. So similarly (in Hab. 3:15): <small>YOU TROD THE SEA WITH YOUR HORSES, THE MORTAR OF MANY WATERS</small>. The Holy One said to them: Yet with the good that I brought upon you, you provoked me. When they came to the desert, I brought the manna down to you for forty years.<sup><xref rid="fn520">10</xref></sup> Moreover, none of them had to ease nature for those forty years. Rather when they ate the manna, it &#x003C;simply&#x003E; became flesh for them, as stated (in Ps. 78:25, 27) <small>EACH ONE ATE THE BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small> (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>); [&#x2026;.<small>AND HE RAINED DOWN MEAT UPON THEM LIKE DUST&#x2026;</small>.] When &#x003C;the manna&#x003E; became body members (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) and flesh,<sup><xref rid="fn521">11</xref></sup> they provoked him with it. Seeing for themselves that they did not have to go out &#x003C;to ease nature&#x003E; like &#x003C;other&#x003E; humans, they began saying to each other: Do you not know that we have had twenty days, even thirty [days], without easing nature? What is this? When a person does not ease nature for four or five days, does he not die or burst open? Now as for us, (according to Numb. 21:5), <small>OUR SOUL LOATHES THIS MISERABLE FOOD</small>. Why was it said to be <small>MISERABLE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QLL</small></italic>)? Because it was light (rt.: <italic><small>QLL</small></italic>) within their bowels.</p>
<p>The Holy One said: In whatever &#x003C;way&#x003E; I did well for them, in &#x003C;that way&#x003E; they provoked me. It is so stated (in Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR &#x003C;IT</small>?&#x003E;&#x2026;. The spies went and looked at the land. Now you find that wherever Israel goes they are recognized. It is so stated (in Is. 61:9): <small>ALL WHO SEE THEM SHALL RECOGNIZE THEM&#x2026;</small>. However (in the case of the spies), the Holy One said: If they see them they will kill them. So what shall I do? In the case of each and every province into which the spies entered, the head of a province was afflicted with plague, or its king [was smitten with plague], in order that they would be occupied with bringing out their dead and not pay attention to the spies.<sup><xref rid="fn522">12</xref></sup> Thus they would not kill them. When they entered and looked at the land, they explored it &#x003C;and found&#x003E; that it was beautiful. Look at how well I treated them&#x0021; Yet by this &#x003C;very land&#x003E; they provoked me. When they came to Moses and to Israel, What did they say (in Numb. 13:32)? <small>THE LAND THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED, IN ORDER TO EXPLORE IT, IS A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One began to cry out (in Is. 5:4): <small>WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO FOR MY VINEYARD THAT I HAVE NOT DONE FOR IT</small>?&#x2026;.</p>
<title>4a.4 Numbers 14:11ff, Part IV</title>
<p>[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?: The Holy One said: I thought and hoped that you would become like the ancestors, of whom it is written (in Hos. 9:10): <small>I FOUND ISRAEL LIKE GRAPES IN THE DESERT; I SAW YOUR ANCESTORS AS THE FIRST FRUIT ON A FIG TREE IN ITS FIRST SEASON</small>. I did not think that you would become like &#x003C;the inhabitants of&#x003E; Sodom, who were burned with fire. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:32): <small>FOR THEIR VINE IS FROM THE VINE OF SODOM, EVEN FROM THE FIELDS OF GOMORRAH</small>. [<small>THEIR GRAPES ARE GRAPES OF POISON&#x2026;</small>.] (Is. 5:4:) <small>WHEN I HOPED FOR IT TO PRODUCE GRAPES, WHY DID IT PRODUCE SOUR GRAPES</small>? &#x003C;You have become&#x003E; like &#x003C;the inhabitants of&#x003E; Sodom, who were burned with fire. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 14:11): <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?</p>
<title>4a.5 Numbers 14:11ff, Part V</title>
<p>[(Numb. 14:11:) <small>HOW LONG WILL THIS PEOPLE SCORN ME</small>?] Moses said to the Holy One: So what do you want? He said to him (in vs. 12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM. THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A NATION THAT IS GREATER AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN THEY</small>. Moses said to him (in vss. 13&#x2013;14, 16): <small>WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HEAR &#x003C;WHAT HAPPENED&#x003E;, FOR YOU DID BRING THIS PEOPLE UP THROUGH YOUR POWER FROM THEIR MIDST, THEY WILL SAY UNTO THE INHABITANTS OF &#x003C;THIS&#x003E; LAND&#x2026;. BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE &#x003C;INTO THE LAND&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. So would not the nations of the world say: The gods of Canaan are stronger than the gods of Egypt?<sup><xref rid="fn523">13</xref></sup> Why? The gods of Egypt are of irrigated land, but those of Canaan are of &#x003C;land&#x003E; watered by rain (i.e., of <italic>Ba&#x2018;al</italic>). (Numb. 14:14, 16:) <small>THEY WILL SAY UNTO THE INHABITANTS OF THIS LAND&#x2026;..

Now the word, <italic>yekholet</italic> can only refer to food, since it is stated (in I Kings 5:25 [11]): <small>AND SOLOMON GAVE HIRAM TWENTY THOUSAND MEASURES OF WHEAT AS FOOD</small> (<italic>makkolet</italic>) <small>FOR HIS HOUSEHOLD</small>.</p>
<title>4a.6 Numbers 14:11ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation: Lest the nations of the world say: He behaves like a brute with you. That is to say: When the generation of the flood came, he destroyed them with water, as stated (in Gen. 7:6): <small>WHEN THE FLOODWATERS CAME UPON THE EARTH</small>. And similarly, when the generation of the dispersion came, he destroyed them. And similarly, when the Egyptians came, he drowned them in water. And also in the case of these whom he has called (in Exod. 4:22) <small>ISRAEL, MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>, here he is destroying (<italic>mekhalleh</italic>) them&#x0021; &#x003C;He is&#x003E; like that Lilith (<italic>keLilit</italic>). When she does not find anything else, she turns on children. So (in Numb. 14:16): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THIS PEOPLE INTO THE LAND WHICH HE HAS SWORN &#x003C;TO GIVE&#x003E; THEM, HE HAS SLAUGHTERED THEM IN THE DESERT</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the World, (according to vs. 14) <small>THAT YOU, O LORD, ARE SEEN FACE TO FACE</small> (literally: <small>EYE TO EYE</small>). What is the meaning of <small>THAT &#x003C;YOU&#x003E; &#x2026; ARE SEEN EYE TO EYE</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>YN B</small></italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>YN</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn524">14</xref></sup> R. Simeon ben Laqish said: See, the scales are balanced (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>YN</small></italic>). You say (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>; but I am saying (in vs. 19): <small>PLEASE PARDON</small>. We shall see whose &#x003C;utterance&#x003E; will stand. The Holy One said to him: By your life, Moses, yours shall stand, while mine is null &#x003C;and void&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 14:20): <small>THEN THE LORD SAID: I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>. But nevertheless, the decree of the Holy One which he had uttered to Moses (in Numb. 14:12): <small>THEN I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A NATION THAT IS GREATER AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN THEY</small>, &#x003C;that decree&#x003E; was not repealed. He raised up from him sixty myriads, and in the world to come the Holy One shall gather them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 49:12): <small>LOOK</small>&#x0021; <small>THESE ARE COMING FROM AFAR. AND LOOK</small>&#x0021; <small>THESE ARE FROM THE NORTH AND FROM THE SEA</small> (i.e., <small>FROM THE WEST</small>), <small>AND THESE FROM THE LAND OF SINIM</small>. Moreover, the exiles shall come with them, also the tribes who are located beyond &#x003C;the River&#x003E; Sambatyon<sup><xref rid="fn525">15</xref></sup> and beyond the darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn526">16</xref></sup> They shall be gathered and come to Jerusalem. It is concerning them that Isaiah has said (in Is. 49:9): <small>SAYING TO THE PRISONERS: GO FORTH</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; to those who are located beyond the Sambatyon. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>TO THOSE WHO ARE IN DARKNESS: SHOW YOURSELVES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn527">17</xref></sup> These are those who are located beyond the cloud of darkness. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEY SHALL PASTURE ALONG THE ROADS, AND</small> &#x007B;<small>UPON</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN ALL</small>] <small>THE HEIGHTS SHALL BE THEIR PASTURE</small>. These are those who are located in Daphne near Antioch.<sup><xref rid="fn528">18</xref></sup> At that time they shall be redeemed and come to Zion with gladness. Isaiah has said (in Is. 51:11): <small>SO LET THOSE RANSOMED BY THE LORD RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH EXALTATION, WITH JOY EVERLASTING UPON THEIR HEADS. LET THEM ATTAIN JOY AND GLADNESS; MAY SORROW AND SIGHING FLEE</small>.</p>
<title>4a.7 Numbers 14:26ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION BE MURMURING AGAINST ME</small>? <small>&#x003C;I HAVE HEARD THE MURMURINGS OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;..</small> Let our master instruct us: When a baby has a stone in his hand on the Sabbath, is it permissible to pick him up on the Sabbath?<sup><xref rid="fn529">19</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in Shab. 21:1): <small>A PERSON MAY PICK UP ONE&#x2019;S CHILD, EVEN WITH A STONE IN HIS HAND, OR A BASKET</small> (of fruit), <small>EVEN WITH A STONE INSIDE IT</small>. You have learned from the generation of the wilderness that the Holy One, as it were, carried them up in the wilderness. (Deut. 1:31:) <small>AND IN THE WILDERNESS, WHERE YOU SAW HOW THE LORD YOUR GOD CARRIED YOU AS</small> &#x007B;<small>THE PERSON</small>&#x007D; [<small>ONE</small>] <small>CARRIES HIS CHILD</small>. Yet there was an object of idolatry in their hand.<sup><xref rid="fn530">20</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Neh. 9:18): <small>EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES A MOLTEN CALF&#x2026;</small>. And so you find that, when they crossed in the sea, Micah&#x2019;s image (of Jud. 17:3&#x2013;4) crossed with them, as stated (in Zech. 10:11): <small>AND A RIVAL WIFE</small><sup><xref rid="fn531">21</xref></sup> <small>SHALL CROSS IN THE SEA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn532">22</xref></sup> Still with all this, the Holy One did not forsake them. He said to Moses: I have done a lot of good things with them; yet they are provoking me a lot. I parted the sea for them; they provoked me, as stated (in Pss. 106:7): <small>THEY REBELLED AT THE SEA</small>, [<small>AT THE</small>] <small>REED</small> [<small>SEA</small>]. I led them in the desert, but they provoked me there. And so it says (in Numb. 14:22): <small>THEY HAVE TRIED ME THESE TEN TIMES AND NOT HEARKENED TO MY VOICE</small>. Here also I told you to send them to explore the land, but they provoked me and brought a bad name upon it (i.e., upon the land). I am not able to endure. How long shall I endure them? Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>?</p>
<title>4a.8 Numbers 14:26ff, Part II</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ad matay</italic>) &#x2026;?] This text is related (to Zech. 7:13): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, AS</small> &#x007B;<small>I</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE CALLED, AND THEY DID NOT HEED; SO LET THEM CALL, AND I WILL NOT HEED, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. &#x003C;It will be&#x003E; measure for measure, said the Holy One. Because I have spoken four times, so you are going to say something similar four times. Four times did I say: <small>&#x003C;HOW LONG</small>?&#x003E;</p>
<ol>

<p>So also shall I deliver them into the hand of four empires, where they are going to cry out four times and say: <small>&#x003C;HOW LONG</small>?&#x003E;</p>
<ol>
<li>(Ps. 13:2&#x2013;3[1&#x2013;2]:) <small>HOW LONG</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ad-&#x2019;anah</italic>), <small>O LORD</small>? <small>WILL YOU FORGET ME FOREVER</small>? concerns Babylon.</li>

</ol>
<p>&#x003C;This is&#x003E; to fulfill what was said (in Zech. 7:13): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT, AS</small> &#x007B;<small>I</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE</small>] <small>CALLED, AND THEY DID NOT HEED; SO LET THEM CALL, AND I WILL NOT HEED</small>,&#x2026;.

<title>4a.9 Numbers 14:26ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>? This text is related (to Mal. 1:11): <small>FOR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN</small> [<small>EVEN</small>] <small>TO WHERE IT SETS MY NAME SHALL BE GREAT AMONG THE GENTILES</small>. The Holy One said: The nations of the world honor me; but as for you, how many miracles have I performed for you?.<sup><xref rid="fn533">23</xref></sup> Still you provoke me. Do you want to know &#x003C;the facts&#x003E;? Eglon, king of Moab, was uncircumcised. Then Ehud ben Gera entered where he was; and as soon as he mentioned my name to him, he showed me honor and rose from his seat, as stated (in Jud. 3:20): <small>NOW WHEN EHUD CAME UNTO HIM, HE WAS SITTING BY HIMSELF IN HIS COOL UPPER ROOM. THEN EHUD SAID: I HAVE A WORD FROM GOD FOR YOU; SO HE AROSE FROM HIS SEAT</small>. &#x003C;This was&#x003E; to fulfill what was said (in Mal. 1:11): F<small>OR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN</small> [<small>EVEN</small>] <small>TO WHERE IT SETS MY NAME SHALL BE GREAT AMONG THE GENTILES</small>. The Holy One said: The nations of the world honor me; and they show me respect. Yet when you provoke me, I plead with you. How long do I tolerate &#x003C;you&#x003E;? (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>?</p>
<title>4a.10 Numbers 14:26ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small> &#x2026;? The Holy One said: Come and see the good things that I did for them when they went to explore the land. Wherever they entered, I made the head of that city die.<sup><xref rid="fn534">24</xref></sup> So when they did enter they found all the people of that city attending to the head of the city. So they did not pay attention to them. However, through the very good which I did for them they spread slander. What did they say to Moses (in Numb. 13:32): <small>&#x003C;THE LAND &#x2026; IS&#x003E; A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS&#x2026;</small>. After all this good which I did for them, lest they be recognized by those on whom they were spying, with the result that they would catch them, when after all these things they spoke slander, I was tolerated them. (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small> &#x2026;?</p>
<title>4a.11 Numbers 14:26ff, Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION</small> &#x2026;? The Holy One said, as it were: Someone buys himself a servant, so that the servant may take the lantern<sup><xref rid="fn535">25</xref></sup> and give light to the one who bought him; but I did not do so. Rather, though you are my servants, as stated (in Lev. 25:55): <small>FOR TO ME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE SERVANTS</small>, I have taken the lantern and given light to them, as stated (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD TO GUIDE THEM ON THE WAY AND BY NIGHT IN A PILLAR OF FIRE TO GIVE THEM LIGHT</small>.</p>
<title>4a.12 Numbers 14:26ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27). By universal custom one buys himself a servant so that, if he sets out on the road, his slave will go ahead and prepare for him safe and well supplied quarters;<sup><xref rid="fn536">26</xref></sup> but I have not done so. Rather, though you are my servants, I prepared quarters &#x003C;for you&#x003E;, as stated (in Numb. 10:33): <small>AND THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TRAVELED AHEAD OF THEM THREE DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY TO SEEK OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM</small>.</p>
<title>4a.13 Numbers 14:26ff, Part VII</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27). By universal custom one buys himself a servant so that his servant will bake bread for him and so that his buyer may eat, but I did not do so. Rather, though you are my servants, I baked for you so that you might eat. It is so stated (in Exod. 16:4): <small>BEHOLD, I WILL RAIN DOWN BREAD FROM THE HEAVENS FOR YOU</small>. And so it says (in Ps. 78:25): <small>EACH ONE ATE THE BREAD OF THE MIGHTY</small>. After all these good things that I did for you, you provoke me. How long shall I endure &#x003C;you&#x003E;? (Numb. 14:27:) <small>HOW LONG SHALL THIS EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>?</p>
<title>4a.14 Numbers 14:26ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 14:27): <small>HOW LONG SHALL &#x003C;THIS&#x003E; EVIL CONGREGATION &#x003C;BE MURMURING AGAINST ME&#x003E;</small>?] The Holy One said to Moses: I am exterminating them from before me, for so it says (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn537">27</xref></sup> Immediately Moses stood up to him by asking for mercy from the Holy One. How? When Israel made the calf, Moses stood up to him. At that time he made a plea on their behalf. He said to him: Please, make known to me by what principle you run your world. Thus it says this (in Exod. 33:13): <small>PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAYS KNOWN TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW YOU&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One said to him: It is by the principle of mercy that I run my world, as stated (in Exod. 34:6): <small>AND THE LORD PASSED BY BEFORE HIM, AND PROCLAIMED: THE LORD, THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, SLOW TO ANGER AND ABOUNDING IN KINDNESS AND TRUTH</small>. When Moses saw that the Holy One had said to him; <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>, he began saying to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, this is what you have said: <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>. Is this &#x003C;the way&#x003E; you are slowing your passion? The Holy One said to him: Even so, I am going to punish them. &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; did nothing, but when the Holy One wanted to destroy them here, where it is stated (in Numb. 14:12): <small>I WILL SMITE THEM WITH PESTILENCE AND DISPLACE THEM</small>, Moses stood up and asked for mercy before the Holy One, as he said to him: Please, are these the stipulations which you prescribed when you said: <small>SLOW TO ANGER</small>? Fulfill your word here (in Numb. 14:17): <small>AND NOW, PLEASE LET THE POWER OF THE LORD INCREASE, EVEN AS YOU HAVE SPOKEN, SAYING</small>. Then what did &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; say (in vs. 18)? <small>THE LORD IS SLOW TO ANGER AND OF GREAT KINDNESS&#x2026;</small>. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, in the case of a servant, if his deeds are good so that his master looks at him with a friendly face, one does not give his master any credit.<sup><xref rid="fn538">28</xref></sup> So when would they give him credit? When the servant&#x2019;s conduct is evil with his deeds being evil, and then his master looks at him with a friendly face. So also in your case, O Sovereign of the Universe, pay no attention to their stiff neck. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 9:27): <small>PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE STUBBORNNESS OF THIS PEOPLE NOR ITS WICKEDNESS NOR ITS SIN</small>. So the Holy One said to him: See, because of you I am forgiving them. It is so stated (in Numb. 14:20): <small>I HAVE PARDONED THEM AS YOU ASKED</small>.</p>
<title>4a.15 Numbers 15:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:1&#x2013;3:) <small>NOW THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&#x003E;: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS WHICH I AM GIVING YOU AND WOULD MAKE AN OFFERING TO THE LORD, A BURNT OFFERING OR A SACRIFICE TO FULFILL A VOW&#x2026;</small>.

What is the meaning of <small>HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>? How should I compare you with love of children? R.

<p>Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; R. Joshua the Levite said: The Holy One said: I argued in your defense<sup><xref rid="fn540">30</xref></sup>, but you made me one who argues your prosecution.<sup><xref rid="fn541">31</xref></sup> <small>HOW I WOULD PUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>YT</small></italic>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>?

<p>Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19): <small>HOW I WOULD I PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; R. Hiyya said: The Holy One said: For which people did I do what I did for you? For which people did I part the sea? To which people did I give the Torah? Which people did I set apart, just as I have set you apart. <small>HOW I WOULD PUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>YT</small></italic>) <small>YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; This language can only be the language of setting apart, since it is stated (in Gen. 30:40): <small>AND HE PUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>S</small>h<small>YT</small></italic>) <small>HIS OWN FLOCKS APART&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19): <small>HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN</small>&#x0021; R. Eliezer said: the Holy One said: For what people did I do what I have done for you? Have I not made you a special people in the world and separated you from all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; peoples?

What is a <small>SHINAR MANTLE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn548">38</xref></sup> A Babylonian<sup><xref rid="fn549">39</xref></sup> robe of royal purple.<sup><xref rid="fn550">40</xref></sup> It is simply that &#x003C;its owner was&#x003E; the one who was the king of Babylon, and he was encamped in the land of Israel. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): <small>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND I SAID: YOU SHALL CALL ME FATHER</small>. What is a father&#x2019;s concern? To love the son? What is a son&#x2019;s concern? He is responsible for his father&#x2019;s comfort, for giving him food and drink? Ergo, you also are responsible for your father who is in the heavens.</p>
<title>4a.17 Numbers 15:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:2:) <small>WHEN YOU COME&#x2026;</small>. What is written below on the matter (in vs. 20)? <small>OF THE FIRST OF YOUR DOUGH YOU SHALL SET ASIDE A LOAF</small> (<italic>hallah</italic>) <small>AS AN OFFERING</small>. Here is the food, but where is the drink? (Vss. 2, 5:) <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small>, [ &#x2026; ] <small>AND &#x003C;A QUARTER HIN OF&#x003E; WINE FOR A LIBATION</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 9:7): <small>GO, EAT YOUR BREAD WITH GLADNESS, AND DRINK YOUR WINE WITH A JOYFUL HEART, FOR GOD HAS ALREADY ACCEPTED YOUR WORKS</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; speaking of Solomon.<sup><xref rid="fn551">41</xref></sup> When he had built the Temple and completed it, what did he do? He celebrated a seven-day dedication. Then he returned and celebrated an additional seven days for the festival (of Tabernacles). But because they had forgotten to keep the Day of Atonement, they were distressed.<sup><xref rid="fn552">42</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: A heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) came forth and said to him (in Eccl. 9:7): <small>GO, EAT YOUR BREAD WITH GLADNESS&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:7): <small>GO, EAT YOUR BREAD WITH GLADNESS&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; speaking of Israel with reference to the sacrifices that they offered. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DRINK YOUR WINE WITH A JOYFUL HEART</small>. &#x003C;These words&#x003E; concern libations. He said to them: Whereas the Holy One is pleased with your sacrifices, it is stated (in Numb. 15:3): <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE AN OFFERING TO THE LORD, A BURNT OFFERING, OR A SACRIFICE&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>4a.18 Numbers 15:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 15:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS&#x2026;</small>. R. Zakkay of Sha&#x2019;av (in Galilee) said: Israel said: Sovereign of the World, in every &#x003C;other&#x003E; place you call this [the Land of Canaan, but here (in Numb. 15:2)] &#x003C;it is&#x003E; <small>THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn553">43</xref></sup> The Holy One said to them: By your life, I gave it to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob: To Abraham I said (in Gen. 24:7): <small>TO YOUR SEED I SHALL GIVE THIS LAND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn554">44</xref></sup> To Isaac I said (in Gen. 26:3): <small>RESIDE IN THIS LAND, AND I WILL BE WITH YOU AND BLESS YOU, FOR TO YOU AND TO YOUR SEED I WILL GIVE ALL THESE LANDS&#x2026;</small>. To Jacob I said (in Gen. 28:13): <small>THE LAND ON WHICH YOU ARE LYING I WILL GIVE TO YOU AND TO YOUR SEED</small>. Since the son inherits from the father, he therefore said unto them (in Numb. 15:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small>.</p>
<title>4a.19 Numbers 15:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 15:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS</small>.] What is written above on the matter in the section on the spies (in Numb. 14:44)? <small>BUT THEY PRESUMED TO GO UP UNTO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BUT THEY PRESUMED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>)? They brought darkness (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>), they made it dark (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>), &#x003C;and&#x003E; they all remained in darkness (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>). Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE ARK OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD AND MOSES DID NOT DEPART FROM THE CAMP</small>. Thus they did not go up with them, since it is stated &#x003C;that&#x003E; they <small>DID NOT DEPART FROM THE CAMP</small>. Moses said: Thus did the Holy One say (in Deut. 1:42): <small>YOU SHALL NEITHER GO UP NOR FIGHT, FOR I AM NOT IN YOUR MIDST</small>. Moses had said to them: Now you have said (in Deut. 1:28) <small>WHERE ARE WE GOING UP TO</small>? <small>OUR BROTHERS HAVE CAUSED OUR HEARTS TO MELT</small> (with fear)&#x2026;. What is the meaning of <small>MELT</small> (<italic>hemassu</italic>)? He made our hearts sink (<italic>himsiv</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn555">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>MELT</small> (<italic>hemassu</italic>): R. Judah b. R. Simon &#x003C;said&#x003E;: They partitioned the heart. &#x003C;<italic>Hemassu</italic> is&#x003E; a Greek<sup><xref rid="fn556">46</xref></sup> word, <italic>hemisu</italic> (which means &#x201C;half&#x201D;).</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>MELT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MSS</small></italic>): Our masters have said: From here &#x003C;one deduces how&#x003E; they tithed the pomegranates.<sup><xref rid="fn557">47</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ma&#x2019;as.</italic> 1:2): &#x003C;They tithe&#x003E; <small>POMEGRANATES, WHEN THEY BECOME SOFT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MSS</small></italic>).</p>
<p>(Deut. 1:28, cont.:) <small>THEY ARE A PEOPLE LARGER AND MORE NUMEROUS THAN WE</small>. He said to them: From the beginning you have been of two minds on the matter. &#x003C;On the positive side&#x003E; (according to Deut. 1:22): <small>THEN YOU ALL DREW NEAR UNTO ME AND SAID: LET US SEND MEN AHEAD OF US &#x003C;TO EXPLORE THE LAND FOR US&#x003E;</small>; but it is written &#x003C;on the negative side&#x003E; (in vs. 27): <small>YOU MURMURED IN YOUR TENTS AND SAID: IT IS BECAUSE THE LORD HATED US THAT HE BROUGHT US OUT &#x003C;FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One says to them (in Mal. 1:2): <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU</small>&#x0021; But they say (in Deut. 1:27): <small>IT IS BECAUSE THE LORD HATED US THAT HE BROUGHT US OUT</small>. Jose b. R. Hanina said, while teaching in the name of R. Ishmael: There is a common<sup><xref rid="fn558">48</xref></sup> proverb that says: What lies in your heart concerning your companion is what lies in my heart concerning me. (Deut. 1:27:) <small>IT IS BECAUSE THE LORD HATED US &#x003C;THAT HE BROUGHT US OUT&#x003E;</small>. They interpreted &#x003C;the verse&#x003E; and said: You yourself know that he hates us. &#x003C;Take the case of&#x003E; a king of flesh and blood who has two sons. Now he also has two fields, one with irrigation and one watered by rain. &#x003C;The field&#x003E; with irrigation will be given to whichever one the king loves, while the one watered by rain will be given to that one whom he hates. The land of Egypt has irrigation, and we were in its midst, while the land of Canaan has rain.<sup><xref rid="fn559">49</xref></sup> So he brought us out from Egypt [to give us the land of Canaan]. Nevertheless (according to Deut. 1:41&#x2013;42): <small>AND EACH OF YOU GIRDED ON HIS WEAPONS OF WAR, AND YOU VENTURED TO GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY. BUT THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: SAY TO THEM: DO NOT GO UP AND DO NOT FIGHT</small>. I had intended to go up with you, but now: <small>DO NOT GO UP</small>. For you it will be a downfall; going up is not for you. Nevertheless (according to vs. 41), [<small>EACH OF</small>] <small>YOU GIRDED ON &#x003C;HIS WEAPONS&#x003E;</small>, and you all had become a single unit. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND YOU VENTURED TO GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND YOU VENTURED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HYN</small></italic>)) <small>TO GO UP INTO THE HILL COUNTRY</small>? That they were saying: Drop by drop the hin<sup><xref rid="fn560">50</xref></sup> will be filled.<sup><xref rid="fn561">51</xref></sup> One text (Deut. 1:43) says: <small>AND YOU ACTED PRESUMPTUOUSLY</small>; while another text (Deut. 1:41) says: <small>AND YOU VENTURED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HYN</small></italic>). What is the meaning of <small>AND YOU ACTED PRESUMPTUOUSLY</small>? That they acted presumptuously against the pleasures (<italic>hanayot</italic>, rt.: <italic><small>HNH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn562">52</xref></sup> of the Holy One.</p>
<title>4a.20 Numbers 15:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Deut. 1:44): <small>THEN THE AMORITES THAT DWELT IN THAT HILL COUNTRY CAME OUT TO MEET YOU, AND THEY PURSUED YOU AS DO THE BEES</small>. Just as the bee immediately dies when it strikes someone, so also it was with you. When one of them touched you, his soul immediately departed.</p>
<p>(Deut. 1:44:) <small>AS DO THE BEES</small>: As the bee flies, so did they fly about you. In the past, when they &#x003C;merely&#x003E; heard a report of you, they died. It is so stated (in Exod. 15:14): <small>WHEN THE PEOPLES HEAR, THEY TREMBLE&#x2026;</small>. now (in Deut. 1:44:) <small>AND THEY PURSUED YOU AS DO THE BEES&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 1:45:) <small>SO YOU RETURNED TO WEEP BEFORE THE LORD, BUT THE LORD WOULD NOT HEED YOUR CRY OR GIVE EAR TO YOU</small>. You, as it were, made strict justice as though it were brutal; <small>BUT THE LORD WOULD NOT HEED YOUR CRY&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 10:11): <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: ARISE, CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE, THAT THEY MAY COME AND POSSESS THE LAND&#x2026;</small>. Now if I had come to execute justice with them, they would not be entering the land. Instead, <small>ARISE, CONTINUE THE JOURNEY AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE&#x2026;</small>. Ergo (in Numb. 15:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME UNTO THE LAND OF YOUR HABITATIONS&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>4a.21 Numbers 15:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 15:3:) <small>AND YOU SHALL MAKE AN OFFERING TO THE LORD, A BURNT OFFERING, OR A SACRIFICE&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One said to them: Whoever offers me a sacrifice in this world, does not offer it in vain.<sup><xref rid="fn563">53</xref></sup> Rather [if] he offers it, it is pleasing to me. Also in the world to come, he shall have the right to make an offering. Then I will accept it, and it shall be pleasing to me. It is so stated (in Mal. 3:4): <small>THEN SHALL THE OFFERING OF JUDAH AND JERUSALEM BE PLEASING TO THE LORD, AS IN THE DAYS OF OLD AND AS IN THE FORMER YEARS</small>.</p>

<title>5.1 Numbers 16:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&#x003E; BETOOK HIMSELF</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;) <small>IS MORE FORMIDABLE THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &#x003C;SUCH&#x003E; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. The <small>BROTHER OFFENDED</small> is Korah, in that he sided against Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn564">1</xref></sup> So he rebelled and sank from whatever glory that he possessed. Now <small>OFFENDED</small> (rt: <italic><small>PS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;) can only imply rebellion, since it is stated (in II Kings 3:7): <small>THE KING OF MOAB HAS REBELLED</small> (<italic><small>PS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;) <small>AGAINST ME</small>. It also says (in II Kings 8:22): <small>THEN DID LIBNAH REBEL</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;). (Prov. 18:19:) <small>&#x003C;SUCH&#x003E; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. &#x003C;These words also refer to Korah,&#x003E; who sided (<italic><small>PS</small>h</italic>&#x2018;) against the Holy One and against Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn565">2</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.2 Numbers 16:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:1): <small>&#x003C;NOW KORAH &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn566">3</xref></sup> <small>TOOK</small> can only be a word for &#x201C;attracting with persuasive words,&#x201D; in that he attracted all the leaders of Israel and the sanhedria &#x003C;to follow&#x003E; after him.<sup><xref rid="fn567">4</xref></sup> Concerning Moses it is written (in Numb. 1:17): <small>SO MOSES AND AARON TOOK THESE MEN&#x2026;</small>. And similarly it is written (in Numb. 20:25): <small>TAKE AARON AND HIS SON &#x003C;ELEAZAR&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Ergo (in Numb. 16:1) <small>NOW KORAH</small> &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>TOOK</small>, in that he drew (i.e., took) their hearts with persuasive words.</p>
<title>5.3 Numbers 16:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; BETOOK HIMSELF &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> &#x007B;Over&#x007D; [Because of] what did he dissent? &#x007B;Over&#x007D; [Because of] Elizaphan, the son of his father&#x2019;s brother, who had been appointed prince (<italic>nasi</italic>) over his clan. So it says (in Numb. 3:30): <small>AND THE PRINCE OF THE ANCESTRAL HOUSE FOR THE KOHATHITE CLAN WAS ELIZAPHAN BEN UZZIEL</small>. Korah said: [Daddy was &#x003C;one of&#x003E;] four brothers. (According to Exod. 6:18:) <small>AND THE SONS OF KOHATH: AMRAM, IZHAR, HEBRON, AND UZZIEL</small>. As for Amram, the first-born, his son, Aaron attained the high priesthood; and his brother, Moses, &#x003C;attained&#x003E; the kingship. So who deserves to get second &#x003C;place&#x003E;? Should it not be the second &#x003C;son&#x003E;. (Exod. 6:18:) <small>AND THE SONS OF KOHATH: AMRAM, IZHAR, &#x003C;HEBRON, AND UZZIEL&#x003E;</small>. Now I am Izhar&#x2019;s son. I deserved to be prince of my clan, but he has appointed the son of Uzziel. Should the youngest of father&#x2019;s brothers become superior to me? See, I am dissenting and declaring everything invalid, whatever he had done. Therefore, there was dissent.</p>
<title>5.4 Numbers 16:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 15:37&#x2013;38)?<sup><xref rid="fn568">5</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING:&#x003E; SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small> [<small>AND TELL THEM</small>] <small>TO MAKE TASSELS FOR THEMSELVES</small>. Korah said to Moses our Master: Moses, in the case of a prayer shawl (<italic>tallit</italic>) which is all blue, what is the rule about it being exempt from &#x003C;having&#x003E; the tassel? Moses said to him: &#x003C;Such a prayer shawl&#x003E; is required to have the tassel. Korah said to him: Would not a prayer shawl which is all blue exempt itself, when four &#x003C;blue&#x003E; threads exempt it? In the case of a house which is full of &#x003C;scriptural&#x003E; books, what is the rule about it being exempt it from &#x003C;having&#x003E; the mezuzah (which contains only two passages of Scripture)? &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; said to him: &#x003C;Such a house&#x003E; is required to have the mezuzah. &#x003C;Korah&#x003E; said to him: Since the whole Torah has two hundred and seventy-five parashot in it,<sup><xref rid="fn569">6</xref></sup> and they do not exempt the house &#x003C;from having the mezuzah&#x003E;, would the two parashot which are in the mezuzah exempt the house? &#x003C;He also&#x003E; said to him: These are things about which you have not been commanded. Rather you are inventing them &#x003C;by taking them&#x003E; out of your own heart. Here is what is written (in Numb. 16:1): <small>&#x003C;NOW KORAH &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK</small>.</p>
<title>5.5 Numbers 16:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK. NOW &#x2026; TOOK</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>) can only be a word of discord, in that his heart carried him away (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>). Thus is &#x003C;the word&#x003E; used (in Job 15:12): <small>HOW YOUR HEART HAS CARRIED YOU AWAY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LQH</small></italic>). This explains what Moses said to them (in Numb. 16:9): <small>IS IT TOO SMALL A THING FOR YOU THAT THE GOD OF ISRAEL HAS SEPARATED YOU &#x003C;FROM THE CONGREGATION TO DRAW YOU NEAR UNTO HIMSELF, TO PERFORM THE SERVICE OF THE LORD</small>&#x2019;s <small>TABERNACLE&#x003E;</small> &#x2026;? &#x003C;plus&#x003E; that whole passage up to (vs. 29:) <small>&#x003C;IF THESE PEOPLE DIE&#x003E; THE COMMON DEATH OF EVERY PERSON</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; The sages have said: Korah was a great sage and was one of the bearers of the Ark, as stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO &#x003C;WAGONS&#x003E;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>. Now Korah was the son of Izhar, &#x003C;who was&#x003E; the son of Kohath. When Moses said (in Numb. 15:38): <small>AND PUT ON THE TASSEL OF EACH CORNER A THREAD OF BLUE</small>, what did he do? He immediately ordered them to make two hundred and fifty blue shawls for those two hundred and fifty heads of sanhedria who rose up against Moses to wrap themselves in, just as it is stated (in Numb. 16:2): <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES</small>, [<small>TOGETHER WITH MEN FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY &#x003C;PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small>] Korah arose and made them a banquet at which they all wrapped themselves themselves in blue prayer shawls. &#x003C;When&#x003E; Aaron&#x2019;s sons came to receive their dues, &#x003C;namely&#x003E; breast and right thigh,<sup><xref rid="fn570">7</xref></sup> they arose against them and said to them: Who commanded you to receive such? &#x003C;The priests&#x003E; said: Moses. &#x003C;Korah&#x2019;s group&#x003E; replied and said: We shall not give you anything, because the Holy One has not commanded it. They came and informed Moses. He went to placate<sup><xref rid="fn571">8</xref></sup> them. They immediately confronted him, as stated (ibid.): <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES</small>. And who were they? Elizur ben Shedeur and his companions, the men (according to Numb. 1:17) <small>WHO WERE MENTIONED BY NAME</small>. Although the text has not publicized<sup><xref rid="fn572">9</xref></sup> their &#x003C;names&#x003E;, it has given clues<sup><xref rid="fn573">10</xref></sup> to their &#x003C; identity&#x003E;, so that you &#x003C;can&#x003E; identify them from the scriptural context. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a scion of good parentage who stole articles from the bathhouse. The owner of what was stolen did not want to publish his &#x003C;name&#x003E;, &#x003C;but&#x003E; he began to give clues to his &#x003C;identity&#x003E;. When they said to him: Who stole your articles? He said: A scion of good parentage, a tall person with beautiful teeth and beautiful hair. After he had given his clues, they knew who he was. So also here where the text has concealed them and not specified their names, it comes and gives clues to their &#x003C;identity&#x003E;. You know who they are. It is stated elsewhere (in Numb. 1:16): <small>THESE WERE ELECTED BY THE CONGREGATION, PRINCES OF THEIR ANCESTRAL TRIBES, HEADS OF THOUSANDS WITHIN ISRAEL</small>. Then it is written (in vs. 17): <small>SO MOSES AND AARON TOOK THESE MEN WHO WERE MENTIONED BY NAME</small>. Now here it is written (in Numb. 16:2): <small>PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION, ELECTED BY THE ASSEMBLY, MEN OF RENOWN</small>.</p>
<title>5.6 Numbers 16:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK</small>. &#x003C;What&#x003E; he took &#x003C;was&#x003E; his prayer shawl, when he went to get counsel from his wife.<sup><xref rid="fn574">11</xref></sup> When the Holy One said (in Numb. 8:6&#x2013;7): <small>TAKE THE LEVITES FROM AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND PURIFY THEM. NOW THIS IS WHAT YOU SHALL DO FOR THEM TO PURIFY THEM &#x2026;, AND HAVE THEM PASS A RAZOR OVER ALL OF THEIR FLESH</small>. He immediately did so to Korah. He began to go around all Israel, but they did not recognize him. They said to him: Who did this to you? He told them: Moses. And not only that but taking me by my hands and by my feet, they waved me (like an offering). Then he said to me: See, you are purified. Moreover, he brought his brother Aaron, adorned him like a bride, and had him sit in the tent of meeting. The enemies of Moses immediately began to incite Israel against him. So they said: Moses is king, his brother Aaron is high priest, and his children are deputy high priests&#x0021; The priest has a priestly offering (<italic>terumah</italic>); the priest has a priestly offering from the tithe<sup><xref rid="fn575">12</xref></sup>; the priest has twenty-four priestly gifts&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn576">13</xref></sup> Immediately (in Numb. 16:3) <small>THEY GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST MOSES AND AGAINST AARON, AND THEY SAID UNTO THEM: YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR</small> (<italic><small>RB</small></italic>), <small>FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY, EVERY ONE OF THEM, AND THE LORD IS IN THE MIDST OF THEM. SO WHY DO YOU ELEVATE YOURSELVES OVER THE COMMUNITY OF THE LORD</small>? R. Levi said: At that very time Korah gathered his company and said to them (i.e., to Moses and Aaron): You have increased (rt.: <italic><small>RBH</small></italic>) the burden upon us to be more than the slavery of Egypt. We were better off under the Egyptians than under your authority, for in each and every year fifteen thousand and forty-five of us die.<sup><xref rid="fn577">14</xref></sup> Now they wished to stone him; therefore (according to vs. 4), <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS, HE FELL ON HIS FACE</small>. Moses said to them: I do not desire kingship, nor does Aaron &#x003C;desire&#x003E; high priesthood. Thus it is stated (in vs. 11): <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU SHOULD MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>? Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the world, did you not command me thus (in Exod. 28:1): <small>AND YOU SHALL BRING NEAR UNTO YOURSELF &#x003C;YOUR BROTHER AARON AND HIS SONS ALONG WITH HIM,&#x2026; TO SERVE ME AS PRIESTS&#x003E;</small>? Now they have arisen against us to kill us. He said to him (in Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN &#x003C;THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> &#x007B;From where?&#x007D; [What does this mean?] R. Nathan said: The Holy One said: If all the magicians of the world gathered together and tried to turn the morning into the evening, they would be unable &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;; but just as I &#x003C;formerly&#x003E; separated the light and the darkness (in Gen. 1:4), so have I separated out Aaron to sanctify him as most holy. Immediately (in Numb. 16:12): <small>THEN MOSES SENT TO SUMMON DATHAN AND ABIRAM, SONS OF ELIAB, BUT THEY SAID: WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. &#x201C;We will not go&#x201D; or &#x201C;We will not come&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. (Prov. 18:17:) <small>A FOOL</small>&#x2019;s <small>MOUTH IS HIS RUIN</small>&#x0021; They opened their mouth about descending by saying that ascent was not for them. Just as they spoke, so did they die (according to Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. Moses said: In as much as they did not want to come &#x003C;to me&#x003E;, I shall go to them. Perhaps they will be ashamed and repent. It is so stated (in Numb. 16:25): <small>THEN MOSES AROSE AND WENT UNTO DATHAN AND ABIRAM</small>. When they saw him they began to reproach and revile &#x003C;him&#x003E;, as stated (in vs. 27): <small>AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM CAME OUT STANDING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>). Does one go out sitting, kneeling, or lying prostrate?<sup><xref rid="fn578">15</xref></sup> It is simply that they went out reproaching and reviling &#x003C;Moses&#x003E;. Going out and standing upright (rt.: <italic><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) is mentioned here. Now going out and standing upright (rt.: <italic><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) is mentioned below in reference to Goliath the Philistine, where it is written (in I Sam. 17:4, 16): <small>AND THERE WENT OUT A CHAMPION &#x003C;FROM THE CAMP OF THE PHILISTINES</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING, AND HE TOOK HIS STAND</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) <small>FOR FORTY DAYS</small>. Just as going out and standing upright (rt.: <italic><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) involved reproaching and reviling in that case,<sup><xref rid="fn579">16</xref></sup> so also in this case did going out and standing upright (rt.: <italic><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) involve reproaching and reviling. Moses therefore began by saying (in Numb. 16:29, 32): <small>IF &#x003C;THESE PEOPLE DIE&#x003E; THE COMMON DEATH OF EVERY PERSON&#x2026;. AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH &#x003C;AND SWALLOWED THEM&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> Come and see how harmful dissension must be&#x0021; Whenever anyone foments dissension, the Holy One eradicates his memory. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:35): <small>AND A FIRE WENT FORTH FROM THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN &#x003C;COFFERING THE INCENSE&#x003E;</small>. R. Berekhyah said: How harmful dissension must be&#x0021; An emissary of the court on high only imposes a penalty<sup><xref rid="fn580">17</xref></sup> &#x003C;on people&#x003E; from the age of twenty years, while the court below &#x003C;only imposes a penalty &#x003E; from the age of thirteen years. In the case of Korah&#x2019;s dissension, however, one-day-old babies were burned and swallowed up in nethermost Sheol. Thus it is written (in Numb. 16:27, 33): <small>&#x003C;AND DATHAN AND ABIRAM CAME OUT STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR TENTS &#x003C;WITH THEIR WIVES, THEIR CHILDREN, AND THEIR LITTLE ONES &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. It is therefore stated (Numb. 16:1): <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; TOOK</small>.</p>
<title>5.7 Numbers 16:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BETOOK HIMSELF</small>. But there is not written &#x201C;ben Jacob&#x201D; &#x003C;or&#x003E; &#x201C;ben Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn581">18</xref></sup> This text is related (to Gen. 49:6): <small>LET NOT MY SOUL COME INTO THEIR COUNCIL</small>, i.e., that of the spies. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND LET NOT MY GLORY BE JOINED WITH THEIR CONGREGATION</small>, i.e., that of Korah. Jacob said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, with reference to the spies and with reference to the dissension of Korah, let not my name be mentioned [in connection with] those evil men, who are going to cause provocation. So when should my name (Israel) be joined &#x003C;with these rebels&#x003E;? When they are joined together to stand on the dais (as Levitical singers). (I Chron. 6:16, 22&#x2013;23 [31, 37&#x2013;38]:) <small>&#x003C;THESE ARE THE ONES WHOM DAVID PUT IN CHARGE OF SONG IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD&#x2026;. &#x003E; BEN ASSIR BEN EBIASAPH BEN KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BEN ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>5.8 Numbers 16:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1, cont.:) <small>ALONG WITH DATHAN AND ABIRAM</small>. From here they derived the saying: Woe to the wicked one, &#x003C;and&#x003E; woe to his neighbor.<sup><xref rid="fn582">19</xref></sup> &#x003C;What is&#x003E; good for a righteous person is good for his neighbor. Because Dathan and Abiram were neighbors of Korah, who was dwelling to the south (of the Tabernacle), as stated (in Numb. 3:29): <small>THE FAMILIES OF THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH WERE TO CAMP &#x003C; ALONG THE SIDE OF THE TABERNACLE TO THE SOUTH&#x003E;</small>. The standard of Reuben was near them, [as stated] (in Numb. 2:10): <small>THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF REUBEN SHALL BE TO THE SOUTH</small>. However, the standard of Judah was in the east, and with him were Issachar and Zebulun, [as stated] (in Numb. 2:3): <small>NOW THESE CAMPING IN FRONT TO THE EAST SHALL BE &#x003C;THOSE UNDER&#x003E; THE STANDARD OF THE CAMP OF JUDAH</small>. And near them were Moses, Aaron, and his children, [as stated (in Numb. 3:38): <small>THOSE WHO CAMPED BEFORE THE TABERNACLE, IN FRONT BEFORE THE TENT OF MEETING TO THE EAST, WERE MOSES, AARON, AND HIS CHILDREN</small>.] Because these were near the Torah, they were therefore worthy to be Torah scholars, as written (in Ps. 60:9 [7]): <small>JUDAH IS MY LAWGIVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn583">20</xref></sup> [It is also written] (in I Chron. 12:33 [32]): <small>AND FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISSACHAR, THOSE WHO HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMES</small>. [And it is written] (in Jud. 5:14): <small>AND FROM ZEBULON THOSE WHO WIELD THE SCRIBAL PEN</small>. But because Dathan and Abiram were neighbors to Korah, a master of dissension, they received &#x003C;their due&#x003E; and perished from the world.</p>
<title>5.9 Numbers 16:1ff, Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:19): <small>AND KORAH GATHERED &#x003C;THE WHOLE COMMUNITY&#x003E; AGAINST THEM</small>. He said to them (in Numb. 16:3): <small>&#x003C;YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR,&#x003E; FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY, EVERY ONE OF THEM</small>, [<small>AND THE LORD IS IN THE MIDST OF THEM</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn584">21</xref></sup> Moreover, every one of them heard on Sinai (in Exod. 20:2 &#x003D; Deut. 5:6): <small>I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. (Numb. 16:3, cont.:) <small>SO WHY DO YOU ELEVATE YOURSELVES</small>? Immediately Moses trembled, because it was already the fourth transgression on their hands. It is comparable to a king&#x2019;s son who had transgressed against his father. Now his friend effected a reconciliation with him once,<sup><xref rid="fn585">22</xref></sup> twice, and three times. When he transgressed a fourth time, the king&#x2019;s friend became discouraged. He said: How many times shall I bother the king. So also &#x003C;it was with&#x003E; Moses. They had sinned with the calf, <small>AND</small> (according to Exod. 32:11) <small>MOSES IMPLORED &#x003C;THE LORD HIS GOD&#x003E;</small>. In the case of the murmurers, (according to Numb. 11:2) <small>MOSES PRAYED UNTO THE LORD</small>. [In the case of the spies, (according to Numb. 14:13): <small>MOSES SAID UNTO THE LORD</small>:] <small>WHEN THE EGYPTIANS HEAR &#x003C;WHAT HAPPENED&#x003E;&#x2026;.:</small> In the case of Korah&#x2019;s dissension, he became discouraged. He said: How often can I bother the Omnipresent? Therefore (in Numb. 16:4): <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS, HE FELL ON HIS FACE</small>.</p>
<title>5.10 Numbers 16:1ff, Part X</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:5:) <small>THEN HE SPOKE UNTO KORAH AND UNTO HIS WHOLE COMPANY, SAYING: IN THE MORNING</small> [<small>THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM</small>]. What reason did he have for saying: <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn586">23</xref></sup> Moses said: Perhaps they said this thing because they had been eating and drinking. He therefore said: <small>IN THE MORNING</small>. Perhaps between now and then they will repent. He said to them: [I] have no authority to enter &#x003C;the Tabernacle &#x003E; now. In his presence there is no eating and no drinking. It is simply that &#x003C;we are forbidden to enter&#x003E; because we have taken food and drink.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING</small>. Moses said: the Holy One has distinguished boundaries for those in his world. Can you confuse morning with evening? And that is what is written in the beginning (in Gen. 1:5): <small>THERE WAS EVENING AND THERE WAS MORNING. AND</small> (in vs. 4) <small>GOD SEPARATED THE LIGHT AND THE DARKNESS</small>, as a service to the world. And just as he made a separation between the light and the darkness, so did he separate Israel from the nations, [as stated] (in Lev. 20:26): <small>I HAVE SEPARATED YOU FROM THE &#x003C;OTHER&#x003E; PEOPLES &#x003C;TO BE MINE&#x003E;</small>. So also did he separate Aaron, [as stated (in I Chron. 23:13): <small>AARON WAS SEPARATED</small>] <small>TO CONSECRATE THE MOST HOLY THINGS, HE AND HIS SONS &#x003C;FOREVER&#x003E;</small>. If you can confuse those distinctions in which he made a separation between the day and the night, you may be able to nullify this. For this reason he said to them (in Numb. 16:5): <small>IN THE MORNING THE LORD WILL MAKE KNOWN THOSE WHO BELONG TO HIM</small>. Such a one is already designated. (According to ibid., end) <small>THE ONE WHOM HE WILL CHOOSE HE WILL HAVE DRAW NEAR UNTO HIM</small>.</p>
<title>5.11 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XI</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:6&#x2013;7:) <small>DO THIS: TAKE CENSERS</small>, [<small>KORAH AND ALL HIS</small> (<italic>sic</italic>) <small>COMPANY</small>]; <small>AND PUT FIRE IN THEM</small>. What was his reason for saying this to them?<sup><xref rid="fn587">24</xref></sup> He said to them: In the religions of those who serve stars there are many idols, many &#x007B;<italic><small>NYMTRYN</small></italic>&#x007D; [laws],<sup><xref rid="fn588">25</xref></sup> and many idol priests. Do they all assemble in one house?<sup><xref rid="fn589">26</xref></sup> Now as for me, I only have one God, one Torah, one justice, one altar, and one high priest; but you two hundred and fifty men are seeking high priesthood&#x0021; I also am willing in this regard. (Numb. 16:11:) <small>THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>. (Numb. 16:6:) <small>DO THIS: TAKE CENSERS</small>. Here you have a ministry more precious than all the others. It is the incense, the most precious of the sacrifices. But a deadly poison had been put within it, through which Nadab and Abihu were burned. He therefore warned them (in vs. 7): <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE&#x2026;</small>. That one already has his sanctification. <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES</small> is already the one. Whomever <small>THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE</small>. It is simply that Moses said to them: See, I am telling you that you are not to incur guilt on your two hundred and fifty souls, because when you sacrifice, &#x003C;only&#x003E; the one to be chosen from among you shall come out alive, and all &#x003C;the rest&#x003E; of you shall perish.</p>
<title>5.12 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:7) <small>YOU LEVITES HAVE GONE TOO FAR</small>&#x0021; See, I have told you&#x0021; Were they not fools, in that when he gave them this warning, they took it upon themselves &#x003C;to offer sacrifice&#x003E;?<sup><xref rid="fn590">27</xref></sup> They had sinned against their own lives, as stated (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): <small>THE CENSERS OF THESE WHO HAVE SINNED AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES</small>. Now since Korah was a clever man, how did he see fit to commit this folly? It is simply that his eyes misled him. He foresaw a great lineage stemming from himself, &#x003C;e.g.,&#x003E; Samuel, who was the equivalent of Moses and Aaron. Moreover, the twenty-four &#x003C;Levitical&#x003E; courses would stem from his sons, all of whom would prophesy by the Holy Spirit, [as stated] (in I Chron. 25:5): <small>ALL THESE WERE SONS OF HEMAN</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn591">28</xref></sup> <small>THE KING&#x2019;S SEER IN MATTERS PERTAINING TO GOD FOR HIS GREATER GLORY</small>. He said: Is is possible that, when this greatness is going to stem from me, I should perish? But he did not foresee correctly, since his children would repent, and those &#x003C; great ones&#x003E; would stem from them. Thus did he foresee.<sup><xref rid="fn592">29</xref></sup> He therefore acted the fool in going against that statute, when he heard from the mouth of Moses that they all would perish but one would escape. (Numb. 16:7:) <small>THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE MAN WHOM THE LORD CHOOSES IS THE HOLY ONE</small>.</p>
<title>5.13 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:8:) <small>SO MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH: PLEASE LISTEN, YOU CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. When you have someone speaking with Joseph, does he tell Simon to Listen?<sup><xref rid="fn593">30</xref></sup> Some say that he wished him to reconsider. So he said gentle words to him. When he saw that he did not listen to him, he said (to himself): Before others associate themselves with him, they should reconsider. He began to urge them (in Numb. 16:8): <small>PLEASE LISTEN, YOU CHILDREN OF LEVI</small>. Is the honor that you have too little? (Vs. 9:) <small>IS IT TOO SMALL A THING FOR YOU</small> &#x2026;? He turned again to Korah (in vs. 10): <small>THAT HE HAS HAD YOU APPROACH HIM AND ALL YOUR BROTHER LEVITES ALONG WITH YOU</small>? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because he was the head person in the tribe, that his brothers had become an extension of himself.</p>
<title>5.14 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XIV</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:11:) <small>THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>. Is this dissension which you are creating against us? Is it not rather against the Holy One? It is comparable to a king who had a lot of slaves. He wanted to make one of them a freedman and give him the &#x003C;centurion&#x2019;s&#x003E; rod.<sup><xref rid="fn594">31</xref></sup> He went further and made him &#x003C;one of the&#x003E; senators.<sup><xref rid="fn595">32</xref></sup> His companions rose up against him. If he had made himself a freedman and taken this dignity for himself, it would have been well for them to rise up against him. Now that his master has acted for him, when anyone rises against him, is not such a one rising up against his master? So also did Moses say to them: If my brother Aaron had taken the priesthood for himself, it would have been well for you to murmur against him. &#x003C;Since&#x003E; the one who gave it to him was the Holy One, to whom belong royalty and high office, whenever someone rises against my brother Aaron, is he not taking sides against the Holy One? It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11): <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>? Come and see the piety of Aaron the Righteous&#x0021; When Moses poured the anointing oil upon Aaron, Aaron trembled with fear. He said to his brother Moses: Perhaps I was not worthy to be anointed with the anointing oil; for I may have acted fraudulently and become liable to excision, since it is stated (in Exod. 30:32): <small>UPON HUMAN FLESH IT SHALL NOT BE POURED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn596">33</xref></sup> Therefore, the Holy One has testified over him (in Ps. 133:1&#x2013;3): <small>SEE HOW GOOD AND PLEASANT IT IS &#x2026; &#x0021; IT IS LIKE THE PRECIOUS OIL</small> [<small>UPON THE HEAD</small>] <small>RUNNING DOWN ONTO THE BEARD, THE BEARD OF AARON &#x2026;; LIKE THE DEW OF HERMON&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;Scripture&#x003E; has compared the anointing oil with the dew of Hermon. As the dew of Hermon has no &#x003C;rules concerning&#x003E; fraudulent use, nether does the anointing oil that was on the head of Aaron have &#x003C;rules concerning&#x003E; fraudulent use. It is therefore written (in Numb. 16:11): <small>&#x003C;THEREFORE YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY&#x003E; HAVE COME TOGETHER AGAINST THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>5.15 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XV</title>
<p>[(Numb. 16:11, cont.:) <small>AND AS FOR AARON, WHAT IS HE THAT YOU MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>?] With all these words Moses &#x003C;tried to&#x003E; appease Korah, but you do not find that he gave him any answer. Because he was clever in his wickedness, he said &#x003C;to himself&#x003E;: If I answer him, I know that, since he has great wisdom, he will now overwhelm me with his words and seduce me into being reconciled with him against my will. It is better that I not respond to him. When Moses saw that there was nothing to be gained with him, he withdrew from him. (Numb. 16:12:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT TO SUMMON DATHAN AND ABIRAM &#x003C;SONS OF ELIAB&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn597">34</xref></sup> They also persisted in their wickedness and did not care to answer him. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THEY SAID: WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>. Their &#x003C;very&#x003E; mouths tripped up &#x003C;these&#x003E; wicked men, for a covenant was made on &#x003C;their&#x003E; lips. So they went down to Sheol, as stated (in Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE TO SHEOL</small>. After they had gone down alive to sheol, they died.</p>
<title>5.16 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XVI</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:13:) <small>IS IT SO SMALL A MATTER THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT US UP &#x003C;FROM A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY TO KILL US IN THE DESERT, THAT YOU MUST ALSO LORD IT OVER US&#x003E;</small>? On what basis do you assume superiority over us? What good have you done with us? You brought us out of the land of Egypt, which was (according to Gen. 13:10) <small>LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD</small>; but you have not brought us into the land of Canaan. Rather here we are dying in the desert, where the plague is sent among us every day. (Numb. 16:14:) <small>WOULD YOU PUT OUT THE EYES OF THESE PEOPLE</small>? <small>WE WILL NOT COME UP</small>.</p>
<title>5.17 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XVII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:15:) <small>NOW MOSES WAS VERY ANGRY</small>. Why was he upset? Because a person who argues with his companion reasons with him. When he answers him, he has peace of mind; but if he does not answer him, then this involves great anguish.</p>
<title>5.18 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XVIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:15, cont.:) <small>AND HE SAID UNTO THE LORD: PAY NO ATTENTION UNTO THEIR MEAL OFFERING</small>. Do not receive them in repentance.<sup><xref rid="fn598">35</xref></sup> Should Scripture have said: &#x201C;Pay no attention unto their liturgical service&#x201D;? What is the meaning of <small>MEAL OFFERING</small>? This is what Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, I know that these have a share in this meal offering that &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; has presented,<sup><xref rid="fn599">36</xref></sup> [since it is stated] (in Numb. 29:22, 28, and 38): <small>IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR BURNT OFFERING, ITS MEAL OFFERING, AND ITS DRINK OFFERING</small>; and it was presented &#x003C;as an offering&#x003E; of what belonged to all Israel (including sinners). In as much as these have withdrawn from your children, do not pay attention to their portion. The fire will leave it alone and not consume it.</p>
<title>5.19 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XIX</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:15, cont.:) &#x003C;Moses continued:&#x003E; <small>I HAVE NOT TAKEN ONE DONKEY FROM THEM</small>. That which I had a right to take I did not take. By universal custom, one who works in the sanctuary receives wages from the sanctuary.<sup><xref rid="fn600">37</xref></sup> &#x003C;In my case, however,&#x003E; when I went down from Midian to Egypt I had a right to take a donkey from them, since it was on behalf of their needs that I was going down &#x003C;there&#x003E;; but I did not take &#x003C;one&#x003E;. Similarly also did Samuel the Righteous say (in I Sam. 12:3): <small>HERE AM I</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn601">38</xref></sup> <small>TESTIFY AGAINST ME BEFORE THE LORD AND BEFORE HIS ANOINTED. WHOSE OX HAVE I TAKEN</small>? <small>OR WHOSE DONKEY HAVE I TAKEN</small>? When I sacrificed an ox for their offerings to seek mercy for them and likewise for anointing a king over them, it belonged to me, as stated (in I Sam. 16:2): <small>TAKE A HEIFER WITH YOU&#x2026;</small>. And similarly it says (in I Sam. 9:12): <small>BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAVE A SACRIFICE TODAY AT THE HIGH PLACE</small>. But I took nothing from what belonged to them. Also when I went back to handle their lawsuits and their &#x003C;other&#x003E; needs, and when I made the circuit of the cities, as stated (in I Sam. 7:16): <small>AND HE WENT &#x003C;ON A CIRCUIT&#x003E; YEAR BY YEAR &#x003C;TO BETHEL, GILGAL, AND MIZPAH; AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL IN ALL THOSE PLACES</small>, although&#x003E; by universal custom litigants go to the judge, I went around from city to city and from place to place.<sup><xref rid="fn602">39</xref></sup> Now even Moses said to Israel (in Exod. 18:16): <small>WHEN THEY HAVE A MATTER, IT COMES UNTO ME</small>. But I (Samuel) did not act in this way. Instead I took the trouble to go to them. (Numb. 16:15, cont.:) <small>AND I HAVE NOT HARMED A SINGLE ONE OF THEM</small>, in that I neither convicted the innocent nor acquitted the guilty. When Moses saw that they continued in their pride and in their rebellious acts, <small>THEN</small> (according to Numb. 16:16&#x2013;18) <small>MOSES SAID UNTO KORAH: &#x003C;TOMORROW&#x003E; YOU AND ALL YOUR COMPANY &#x003C;ARE TO BE PRESENT BEFORE THE LORD: YOU, THEY, AND AARON &#x003E;; AND LET EACH ONE TAKE HIS CENSER&#x2026;. SO EACH ONE TOOK HIS CENSER&#x2026;</small>. Then Korah went about all that night and led Israel astray. Now he would say to them: What do you suppose? That I am busy obtaining greatness for myself? I wish for greatness to go the rounds to all of us, while Moses has taken greatness for himself and has given the high priesthood to his brother Aaron as an eternal statute.<sup><xref rid="fn603">40</xref></sup> So did he go about seducing each and every tribe as it suited him, until they took his side. How is it shown? Because when (according to vs. 19) they entered and came with him, immediately (we read in Numb. 16:20&#x2013;22): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON, SAYING&#x003E;: SEPARATE YOURSELVES &#x003C;FROM THE MIDST OF THIS CONGREGATION, SO THAT I MAY CONSUME THEM IN A MOMENT&#x003E;. BUT THEY FELL ON THEIR FACES AND SAID: O GOD, THE GOD OF ALL HUMAN SPIRITS, &#x003C;SHALL ONE PERSON SIN AND YOU BECOME ANGRY WITH THE WHOLE CONGREGATION&#x003E;</small>? They said to him:<sup><xref rid="fn604">41</xref></sup> Sovereign of the World, in the case of a king, when a province rebels against him, when they persist in cursing the king or his deputies, ten or twenty of them, he sends out his legions<sup><xref rid="fn605">42</xref></sup> and carries out reprisals<sup><xref rid="fn606">43</xref></sup> against it. So he kills the good with the evil, because he does not know who among them has rebelled and who has not rebelled, who has honored the king and who has cursed him. You, however, know the thoughts of every person, even what the hearts and the reins counsel. So you know who has sinned and who has not sinned, for you know the spirit of each and every person. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:22): <small>O GOD, THE GOD OF ALL HUMAN SPIRITS</small>. The Holy one said to them: You have spoken well. I am making the matter known, who has sinned and who has not sinned.</p>
<title>5.20 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XX</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:23&#x2013;24:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE</small> [&#x2026;:] <small>SPEAK UNTO THE CONGREGATION, SAYING: GET AWAY FROM ABOUT &#x003C;THE DWELLINGS OF KORAH, DATHAN, AND ABIRAM&#x003E;</small>. Although Moses heard it from the mouth of the Almighty,<sup><xref rid="fn607">44</xref></sup> he did not tell them to get away until he had gone and warned them, as stated (in vs. 25): <small>THEN MOSES AROSE AND WENT &#x003C;UNTO DATHAN AND ABIRAM&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This serves&#x003E; to make their wickedness known, for although Moses went to them on foot, the&#x003C;se&#x003E; wicked ones were too stubborn to make amends. What did they do? They were unwilling to come out of their tents to face him. When Moses saw this, he said: This much &#x003C;only&#x003E; it was incumbent upon me to do.</p>
<title>5.21 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXI</title>
<p>[(Numb. 16:26:) <small>PLEASE MOVE AWAY FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED PEOPLE</small>.] Our masters have taught: Four &#x003C; types of people &#x003E; are called wicked:<sup><xref rid="fn608">45</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>The one who extends his hand against his companion to strike him. Even though he did not &#x003C;actually&#x003E; strike him, he is called wicked, as stated (in Exod. 2:13): <small>SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE: WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE</small><sup><xref rid="fn609">46</xref></sup> <small>YOUR COMRADE</small>? &#x201C;&#x003C;Why&#x003E; did you strike?&#x201D; is not stated here but <small>WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE</small>?</li>
<li>The one who borrows and does not repay, as stated (in Ps. 37:21): <small>THE WICKED PERSON BORROWS BUT DOES NOT REPAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn610">47</xref></sup></li>
<li>[Also the one who has an insolent face but does not feel shame from someone greater than himself, as stated (Prov. 21:29): <small>A WICKED PERSON PUTS ON A BRAZEN FACE</small>.]</li>
<li>And the one who is the author of dissension, as stated (in Numb. 16:26): <small>PLEASE MOVE AWAY FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED</small> [<small>PEOPLE</small>].</li>
</ol>
<p>Now two &#x003C;of these traits&#x003E; were in Dathan and Abiram, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; an insolent face and dissension (<italic><small>MHLQT</small></italic>). <italic><small>MHLQT</small></italic> (&#x201C;dissension&#x201D;) is interpreted through its letters. <italic><small>M</small></italic> is for <italic>makkah</italic> (&#x201C;striking&#x201D;); <italic><small>H</small></italic> is for <italic>herem</italic> (&#x201C;destruction&#x201D;); <italic><small>L</small></italic> is for <italic>liqquy</italic> (&#x201C;blemish&#x201D;); <italic><small>Q</small></italic> is for <italic>qelalah</italic> (&#x201C;curse&#x201D;); and <italic><small>T</small></italic> is for <italic>to</italic> &#x2018;<italic>evah</italic> (&#x201C;<italic>abomination</italic>&#x201D;). <italic>But some say</italic> &#x003C;<italic>that <small>T</small></italic> stands for&#x003E; <italic>takhlit</italic> (&#x201C;end&#x201D;), &#x003C;since dissension&#x003E; brings annihilation to the world.</p>
<title>5.22 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:27:) <small>SO THEY GOT AWAY FROM THE DWELLINGS OF KORAH, &#x003C;DATHAN, AND ABIRAM&#x003E;</small>. When they saw this, how that Israel had moved away from round about them, they came out uttering abusive language, as stated (ibid., cont.) <small>&#x003C;THEY&#x003E; CAME OUT STANDING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>). Now &#x003C;it is stated&#x003E; elsewhere (in I Sam 17:16): <small>THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING; &#x003C;AND HE TOOK HIS STAND</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YT</small>s<small>B</small></italic>) <small>FOR FORTY DAYS&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn611">48</xref></sup> Moses began by saying (in Numb. 16:28): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME&#x2026;</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn612">49</xref></sup> To the <italic>shoshbin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn613">50</xref></sup> of a king&#x2019;s daughter in whose hands lay the testimonials of her &#x003C;virginity&#x003E;. When one of the banqueters stood up before him. He cursed the <italic>shoshbin,</italic> [and said:] The king&#x2019;s daughter has no virginity, the <italic>shoshbin</italic> arose in the presence of the king and said to him: [If] you do not have this person brought out in order to execute him in everyone&#x2019;s presence, I shall say: Of course the king&#x2019;s daughter has no virginity. Immediately the King said: It is better for me to kill this person, so that the <italic>shoshbin</italic> will not give out a bad name concerning my daughter. Similarly Korah contended with Moses and said: It was in his own heart and on his own that Moses had said all these things. He began by saying (in Numb. 16:28&#x2013;29): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; IF &#x003C;THESE&#x003E; DIE A NATURAL DEATH</small>, then I also am saying (ibid., cont.): <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>, and I have spoken from my own heart.</p>
<title>5.23 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:31:) <small>THEN IT CAME TO PASS, AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING</small> [&#x2026;], <small>THAT THE GROUND UNDER THEM WAS SPLIT APART</small>, since he causes retribution to spring up from any place that he wants.<sup><xref rid="fn614">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 16:33:) <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN &#x003C; ALIVE INTO SHEOL&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Some say they are alive and being punished up to the present.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN THE EARTH CLOSED OVER THEM</small>. They perished but not their offices; indeed, other ministers were appointed in their stead.</p>
<p>(Numb. 16:34:) <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL, SINCE THEY WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM, FLED AT THEIR CRY</small>; so that they cried out to Moses: Moses our Master, save us&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Numb. 16:35:) <small>AND A FIRE WENT FORTH FROM THE LORD AND CONSUMED THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN OFFERING THE INCENSE</small>. The other ones had been swallowed up, but these were burned; and Korah stood among those who were burned, as Moses had said (in Numb. 16:17): <small>YOU ALSO AND AARON, EACH HIS CENSER</small>. Moreover, Korah received more &#x003C;punishment&#x003E; than all of them, in that he was &#x003C;both&#x003E; burned and swallowed up. And why were both sentences carried out against him? Because if he had been burned but not swallowed up, those who were swallowed up would have complained and said that though only Korah had brought retribution upon them, here they were being swallowed up while he escaped. But if he had been swallowed up and not burned, those who were burned would have complained and said that though only Korah had brought this retribution upon them, here they were burned while he escaped. For that reason he was condemned to both deaths. First in the sight of all who were being burned the fire set ablaze the one in whose hand was the censer with the incense in it. Then the fire rolled him up like a ball,<sup><xref rid="fn615">52</xref></sup> and the fire rolled him along until it brought him to the mouth of the earth among those being swallowed up, as stated (in Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small>.</p>
<title>5.24 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXIV</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>AND ON BEN PELETH</small>. Why was he named On (which means &#x201C;sorrow&#x201D;)?<sup><xref rid="fn616">53</xref></sup> Because he remained in sorrow all his days. (Ibid.:) <small>BEN PELETH</small> (<italic><small>PLT</small></italic>)? The son of (<italic>ben</italic>) one for whom miracles (<italic><small>PL</small>&#x2019;<small>WT</small></italic>) have been performed. Rav said: On ben Peleth had his wife save him; for she said to him: What has this dispute to do with you? If Aaron is the High priest, you are a disciple; [if Korah is high priest, you are &#x003C;still&#x003E; a disciple]. He said to her: I know that the whole community is holy, since it is written in Numb. 16:3): <small>FOR ALL THE CONGREGATION ARE HOLY</small>. What did she do? She gave him wine to drink, got him drunk, and had him lie down in her bed. Then she sat down at the entrance [of the house] and let down her hair.<sup><xref rid="fn617">54</xref></sup> Everyone who came for her husband On saw her and returned. In the meanwhile they were swallowed up. It is this which is written (in Prov. 14:1): <small>THE WISDOM OF WOMEN BUILDS ITS HOUSE</small>. This refers to the wife of On. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT FOLLY TEARS IT DOWN WITH ITS OWN HANDS</small>. This refers to the wife of Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn618">55</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.25 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXV</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:2:) <small>AND THEY ROSE UP AGAINST MOSES, TOGETHER WITH MEN FROM THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION, ELECTED BY THE ASSEMBLY</small>, because they knew how to intercalate years<sup><xref rid="fn619">56</xref></sup> and fix new moons.<sup><xref rid="fn620">57</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>MEN OF RENOWN</small>, in that they had a name throughout the whole [world].</p>
<p>(Numb. 16:4:) <small>WHEN MOSES HEARD THIS</small>. What news did he hear? That they suspected him of &#x003C;adultery with&#x003E; a married woman. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 106:16): <small>AND THEY WERE JEALOUS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QN</small></italic>&#x2019;)<sup><xref rid="fn621">58</xref></sup> <small>OF MOSES IN THE CAMP</small>. Rav Samuel bar Isaac said that Rav said: &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that each and every one suspected (rt.: <italic><small>QN</small></italic>&#x2019;) his wife of adultery with Moses.</p>
<title>5.26 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXVI</title>
<p>Rabba expounded [that which is written] (in Hab. 3:11): <small>SUN AND MOON REMAIN ON HIGH</small> (<italic>zevul</italic>). <small>&#x003C;THEY GO FOR THE LIGHT OF YOUR ARROWS, FOR THE BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR SHINING SPEAR</small>. &#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn622">59</xref></sup> &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that the sun and moon ascended to Zebul (the fourth heaven) and said to him: Sovereign of the World, if you act justly toward the son of Amram, we shall go forth; but if not, we shall not go forth. &#x003C;So they refused to shine, &#x003E; until he hurled darts at them. He said to them: For my honor you did not protest,<sup><xref rid="fn623">60</xref></sup> but for flesh and blood you did protest. And at the present time until they have protested, they do not come out.<sup><xref rid="fn624">61</xref></sup></p>
<title>5.27 Numbers 16:1ff, Part XXVII</title>
<p>Rabba expounded what is written (in Numb. 16:30): <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW, &#x003C;AND THE EARTH OPENS ITS MOUTH&#x003E;</small>. To what &#x003C;does the verse refer&#x003E;? If we say to an actual creation of something, then is it not written (in Eccl. 1:9): <small>FOR THERE IS NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN</small>. Rather &#x003C;it refers&#x003E; to bringing the opening (into Gehinnom) up close (to the surface of the earth where Korah was standing).<sup><xref rid="fn625">62</xref></sup> (Numb. 26:11:) <small>THE SONS OF KORAH, HOWEVER, DID NOT DIE</small>. It was taught in the name of our master: A place was set aside for them in Gehinnom where they sat [and uttered hymnody]. Rabbah bar bar Hanah said: One time it happened that we were travelling on the road, when a certain Arab merchant said to me:<sup><xref rid="fn626">63</xref></sup> Come, I will show you chasms of Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn627">64</xref></sup> I went and saw two fissures out of which was coming smoke. He took a ball of clipped wool, steeped it in water, placed it on a spearhead, &#x003C;and raised it over them&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn628">65</xref></sup> Then he said to me: Listen, what do you hear. I actually heard them saying: Moses and his Torah represent truth, but they (i.e., Korah and his companions) are liars. So in the world to come the Holy One is going to take them out &#x003C;of Gehinnom&#x003E;. Moreover, it is with reference to them that Hannah said (in I Sam. 2:6): <small>THE LORD BRINGS DEATH AND GIVES LIFE; HE BRINGS DOWN TO SHEOL AND RAISES UP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn629">66</xref></sup></p>

<title>Appendix to Chapter 5: Numbers, Parashah Va: Supplement to <italic>Qorah</italic></title>
<title>5a.1 Numbers 16:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:)<sup><xref rid="fn630">1</xref></sup> <small>NOW KORAH BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI BETOOK HIMSELF</small> (literally: <small>TOOK</small>)&#x2026;. Let our master instruct us: Is it legitimate to save the Holy Scriptures on the Sabbath? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Shab.</italic> 16:1): <small>IN THE CASE OF ALL HOLY SCRIPTURES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn631">2</xref></sup> <small>ONE SHOULD SAVE THEM FROM THE FIRE WHETHER ONE READS FROM THEM OR DOES NOT READ FROM THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn632">3</xref></sup> As for the books of the <italic>minim,</italic> however, one does not save them from the fire on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn633">4</xref></sup> R. Jose the Galilean says: If I find the books of the <italic>minim,</italic> I cut out their Divine Names and burn the rest.<sup><xref rid="fn634">5</xref></sup> R. Tarfon said to him: May I bury my children, if the books of the <italic>minim</italic> should fall into my hands, I should burn them together with their Divine Names. Moreover, if someone were pursuing me, I should flee into an idolatrous temple, but I should not flee to a house of the <italic>minim.</italic> &#x003C;The reason is&#x003E; that idolaters do not know the Holy One when they deny him, [while these do know him when they deny him]; and it is concerning them that David said (in Ps. 139:21): <small>DO I NOT HATE THOSE WHO HATE YOU O LORD</small>? <small>AND LOATHE THOSE WHO RISE UP AGAINST YOU</small> &#x2026;? What caused Korah to disappear from the world? It could only be that he withdrew into heresy (<italic>minut</italic>) and sided against Moses and Aaron. Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 16:1): <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&#x003E; TOOK</small> (heretical texts)&#x2026;.</p>
<title>5a.2 Numbers 16:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&#x003E; BETOOK HIMSELF&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &#x003C;FORMIDABLE&#x003E; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &#x003C;SUCH&#x003E; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small>. This &#x003C;verse&#x003E; teaches about Korah.<sup><xref rid="fn635">6</xref></sup> <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &#x003C;FORMIDABLE&#x003E; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small>. This is Korah when he rebelled against the Torah, because that is the fortified city (literally: city of strength [&#x2018;<italic>oz</italic>]) of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH</small> (&#x2018;<italic>oz</italic>) <small>TO HIS PEOPLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn636">7</xref></sup> Moreover, he started a quarrel with Moses, as stated (in Prov. 18:19, cont.): <small>&#x003C;SUCH&#x003E; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR</small> (<italic>beriah</italic>). What is the meaning of <small>BAR</small> (<italic>beriah</italic>)? That he removed him (as in Jonah 2:7 [6]) <small>TO THE LAND WHERE ITS BARS</small> (<italic>beriheha</italic>) <small>CLOSED UPON</small> him. And what caused him to come to all this disgrace? Simply the fact that he sided against Moses and Aaron. But what did he say? See what the son of Amram did&#x0021; He gave the priesthood to his brother Aaron and took the kingship for himself,<sup><xref rid="fn637">8</xref></sup> while he made him (i.e., Korah) &#x007B;a porter&#x007D; a common laborer,<sup><xref rid="fn638">9</xref></sup> as stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>&#x003C;BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO WAGONS&#x003E;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn639">10</xref></sup> When he was carrying the Ark, he began to take issue with them and say: Moses is no prophet, Aaron is no high priest, and Torah has not been given from the heavens. When Moses heard that, he began to go to the Holy One. He said to him: I will overlook my own insult and Aaron&#x2019;s insult, but for the insult to Torah I do make a claim, as stated (in Numb. 16:28): <small>BY THIS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THE LORD HAS SENT ME&#x2026;. &#x003C;IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH &#x2026;, THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>.&#x003E; Now <small>THIS</small> can only refer to Torah, since it is stated (in Deut. 4:44): <small>AND THIS IS THE TORAH WHICH MOSES SET &#x003C; BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. It is comparable<sup><xref rid="fn640">11</xref></sup> to the <italic>shoshbin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn641">12</xref></sup> of a king&#x2019;s daughter, who asked a <italic>bene ficium</italic> [which should be read &#x003C;as a single word,&#x003E; &#x003C;<italic>beneficium</italic>&#x003E;]<sup><xref rid="fn642">13</xref></sup> from the king. He said to the King: If you do not seek my <italic>bene ficium</italic> [which should be read &#x003C;as a single word&#x003E;, <italic>beneficium</italic>], I also shall say that your daughter did not have virginity. Similarly did Moses say to the Holy One: If those die &#x003C;natural deaths&#x003E; on their beds, just as all humans &#x003C;normally&#x003E; die, with the physicians coming to visit them according to the custom that all the sick are visited, I also will make a denial and say: Surely no Torah has been given from the heavens. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 16:29): <small>IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH &#x2026;, &#x003C;THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>.&#x003E;</p>
<title>5a.3 Numbers 16:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>This is one of the three prophets who spoke in this way: Elijah, Micah, and Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn643">14</xref></sup> Now in the case of Elijah, what did he say? (I Kings 18:36&#x2013;37): <small>O LORD, GOD OF ABRAHAM, ISAAC, AND ISRAEL, LET IT BE KNOWN TODAY THAT YOU ARE GOD IN ISRAEL, THAT I AM YOUR SERVANT, AND THAT I HAVE DONE ALL THESE THINGS AT YOUR BIDDING. ANSWER ME O LORD, ANSWER ME, SO THAT THIS PEOPLE MAY KNOW THAT YOU, O LORD, ARE GOD</small>. But if you do not answer me, I will say (ibid., cont.): <small>AND YOU HAVE TURNED THEIR HEARTS BACK</small>. So also in the case of Micah (identified here with Micaiah). What did he say to Ahab (in I Kings 22:28)? <small>IF YOU RETURN IN PEACE</small>, then I will say (ibid. cont.): <small>THE LORD HAS NOT SPOKEN THROUGH ME</small>. And Moses also said (in Numb. 16:29): <small>IF THESE DIE A NATURAL DEATH</small> &#x2026;, then I will say (ibid. cont.): <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>. The Holy One said to him: Moses, what do you want? Moses said to him: Sovereign of the World, (in Numb. 16:30): <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES &#x003C;SOMETHING NEW&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. If you have created a mouth to the earth from the beginning of the creation of the world, well and good; but if not, let the Lord create a mouth now. The Holy One said to him: But you have so spoken (in Job 22:28): <small>WHEN YOU DECREE SOMETHING, IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR YOU; AND LIGHT SHALL SHINE UPON YOUR WAYS</small>.</p>
<title>5a.4 Numbers 16:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:32): <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH, AND SWALLOWED &#x003C;THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, EVERY PERSON THAT BELONGED TO KORAH, AND THEIR PROPERTY&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. R. Judah says: At that time a lot of mouths into the earth were opened.<sup><xref rid="fn644">15</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Deut. 11:6): <small>&#x003C;THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOWED THEM, THEIR HOUSEHOLDS, THEIR TENTS, AND EVERYTHING SUBSTANTIAL WHICH FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS,&#x003E; IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE EARTH</small>&#x007D; [<small>ISRAEL</small>].<sup><xref rid="fn645">16</xref></sup> R. Nehemiah said to him: But note what is written (in Numb. 16:32): <small>THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small> (with <small>MOUTH</small> in the singular) <small>AND ATE</small><sup><xref rid="fn646">17</xref></sup> <small>THEM&#x2026;</small>. He said to him: Then how do you reconcile <small>IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE EARTH</small>&#x007D; [<small>ISRAEL</small>]? It is simply that the earth became like a funnel; and from wherever &#x003C;any&#x003E; one of them was standing in relation to him (i.e., to Korah), he rolled and went down with him. You have succeeded in reconciling <small>IN THE MIDST OF ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>THE EARTH</small>&#x007D; [<small>ISRAEL</small>]; you have succeeded in reconciling <small>AND THE EARTH OPENED ITS MOUTH</small>. But what is the meaning (of Deut. 11:6): <small>AND EVERYTHING SUBSTANTIAL</small> (<italic>yequm</italic>) <small>WHICH FOLLOWED IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS</small> (literally: <small>WHICH WAS IN THEIR FEET</small>)? This is wealth (<italic>mamon</italic>), since it puts &#x003C;a person&#x003E; on &#x003C;one&#x2019;s&#x003E; feet.<sup><xref rid="fn647">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our masters say: Even if they had garments at the cleaner, they (i.e., the garments) came rolling and were swallowed up along with &#x003C; their owners &#x003E;. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: Even a needle which had been borrowed (<italic><small>S</small>h&#x2019;<small>WLH</small></italic>) from them by an Israelite, it also was swallowed up along with them.<sup><xref rid="fn648">19</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 16:33): <small>SO THEY AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO THEM WENT DOWN ALIVE INTO SHEOL</small>(<italic><small>S</small>h&#x2019;<small>WLH</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn649">20</xref></sup> Once they had been swallowed up, they cried out and said: Moses is king and prophet, Aaron is high priest, and Torah has been given from the heavens. Moreover, the sound of their voice went through the whole camp of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 16:34): <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL, SINCE THEY WERE ROUND ABOUT THEM, FLED AT THEIR CRY&#x2026;</small>. Why all this? Because he had sided against the Holy One. But nevertheless, in the world to come they are going to rise.<sup><xref rid="fn650">21</xref></sup> R. Judah ben Betera teaches that they do have a share in the world to come. What is written about it (in Numb. 16:33, cont.)? <small>AND THEY VANISHED FROM THE MIDST OF THE COMMUNITY</small>. It is also stated by David (in Ps. 119:176): <small>I HAVE GONE ASTRAY LIKE A LOST</small> (rt. &#x2019;<italic><small>BD</small></italic>) <small>SHEEP; SEEK OUT YOUR SERVANT, FOR I DO NOT FORGET YOUR COMMANDMENTS</small>. Just as a loss (rt. &#x2019;<italic><small>BD</small></italic>), which is written concerning David, is going to be searched for; so (in Numb. 16:33) this loss (rt. &#x2019;<italic><small>BD</small></italic>) is going to be searched for. So also you find that Hannah prayed for them in a prayer,<sup><xref rid="fn651">22</xref></sup> which is uttered (in I Sam. 2:6): <small>THE LORD BRINGS DEATH AND GIVES LIFE; HE BRINGS DOWN TO SHEOL AND RAISES UP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn652">23</xref></sup></p>
<title>5a.5 Numbers 16:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 16:1:) <small>NOW KORAH &#x003C;BEN IZHAR BEN KOHATH BEN LEVI&#x003E; BETOOK HIMSELF&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &#x003C;FORMIDABLE&#x003E; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY; &#x003C;SUCH&#x003E; CONTENTIONS ARE LIKE A CASTLE BAR. A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &#x003C;FORMIDABLE&#x003E; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small>. R. Aha said: this refers to Korah, who was one of the bearers of the Ark.<sup><xref rid="fn653">24</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 7:9) <small>BUT TO THE CHILDREN OF KOHATH HE GAVE NO &#x003C;WAGONS&#x003E;, BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THEIR SHOULDERS</small>. Now he was the greatest in the whole tribe, and yet he sinned against the Ark. (Prov. 18:19): <small>A BROTHER OFFENDED IS MORE &#x003C;FORMIDABLE&#x003E; THAN A FORTIFIED CITY</small> (literally: <small>CITY OF STRENGTH</small> &#x003C;&#x2018;<italic>oz</italic>&#x003E;), and &#x2018;<italic>oz</italic> can only denote an Ark, as stated (in Ps. 78:61): <small>AND HE HAS DELIVERED HIS STRENGTH</small> (&#x2018;<italic>oz</italic>) <small>TO CAPTIVITY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn654">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>6.1 Numbers 19:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 19:2:) <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. Blessed be the name of the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, who created the world in wisdom and understanding; for his wonders have no limit and his greatness is beyond reckoning.<sup><xref rid="fn655">1</xref></sup> (Ps. 33:7:) <small>HE HAS GATHERED THE WATERS OF THE SEA LIKE A MOUND, AND HE HAS PUT THE DEEPS IN STOREHOUSES</small>. Now what is the meaning of <small>HE GATHERS THE WATERS OF THE SEA LIKE A MOUND</small>? When the Holy One created the world, he said to the prince of the sea: Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn656">2</xref></sup> He said to him: Sovereign of the World, it is enough for me to continue with what is &#x003C;already&#x003E; mine. Then he began to weep. He kicked him to death, as stated (in Job 26:12): <small>IN HIS POWER HE STILLED THE SEA, AND IN HIS UNDERSTANDING HE STRUCK DOWN RAHAB</small>. [You find that the prince of the sea was named Rahab. What did the Holy One do? He subdued &#x003C;the waters&#x003E; and trampled them down;] and so it was that the sea accepted them, as stated (in Amos 4:13): <small>HE TRAMPLES ON THE HEIGHTS</small><sup><xref rid="fn657">3</xref></sup> <small>OF THE EARTH; THE LORD</small> [<small>GOD</small>] <small>OF HOSTS IS HIS NAME</small>. So for &#x003C;the waters&#x003E; he set sand in place as bar and gates, according to what is stated (in Job 38:8): <small>AND &#x003C;WHO&#x003E; BLOCKED OFF THE SEA WITH DOORS&#x2026;</small>. Moreover, it says (in Jer. 5:22): <small>DO YOU NOT FEAR ME</small>? <small>SAYS THE LORD</small>. [<small>WILL YOU NOT TREMBLE BECAUSE OF ME</small>,] <small>WHEN I HAVE PLACED SAND AS A BOUNDARY FOR THE SEA</small>? And it says (in Job 38: 10&#x2013;11): <small>&#x003C;&#x2026; AND I SET BAR AND GATES IN PLACE,&#x003E; AND SAID: YOU MAY COME THIS FAR AND NO FARTHER</small>. Then the sea said to him: Sovereign of the World, in that case my sweet waters will be mingled with the salt &#x003C;waters&#x003E;&#x0021; He said to it: No&#x0021; Each and every one will have a storehouse for oneself, as stated (in Ps. 33:7): <small>AND HE HAS PUT THE DEEPS IN STOREHOUSES</small><sup><xref rid="fn658">4</xref></sup> If you should say that this is a great wonder for their waters not to mingle, then consider the face,<sup><xref rid="fn659">5</xref></sup> which the Holy One created in the children of Adam. &#x003C;Although&#x003E; the &#x003C;size of&#x003E; a full <italic>sit</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn660">6</xref></sup> it has so many springs (from &#x2018;<italic><small>YN</small></italic>); yet they do not mingle with one another. The waters of the eyes &#x2018;<italic><small>YN</small></italic>) are salty; the waters of the ears are oily; the waters of the nose are putrid; the waters of the mouth are sweet. For what reason are the waters of the eyes salty? Because when someone weeps for the dead, &#x003C;doing so&#x003E; all the time, he would immediately become blind; however, because &#x003C;tears&#x003E; are salty, he stops and does not weep. For what reason are the waters of the ears oily? Because when a person hears bad news, if he held it in his ears, it would collect in his heart, and he would die. Because they are oily, &#x003C;the news&#x003E; goes in one ear and out the other.<sup><xref rid="fn661">7</xref></sup> For what reason are the waters of the nose putrid? Because when a person emits a bad odor, if the waters of the nose were not putrid &#x003C;enough&#x003E; to stop it, he would soon die. And for what reason are the waters of the mouth sweet? It sometimes happens that someone eats food that does not agree with him, and he vomits. Now if the waters of the mouth were not sweet, he would not recover. Moreover, since he reads the Torah, of which it is written (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB</small>, the waters of the mouth are therefore sweet. Now here are the grounds for arguing a fortiori (<italic>qal wehomer</italic>), that if &#x003C;something&#x003E; &#x003C;the size of&#x003E; a full <italic>sit</italic> has so many springs without them mingling with one another, how much the more so in the case of the Great Sea, of which it is stated (in Ps. 104:25): <small>THERE THE</small> &#x007B;<small>GREAT SEA IS ALSO WIDE</small>&#x007D; [<small>SEA IS GREAT AND WIDE</small>]&#x2026;. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach that in everything the Holy One accomplishes his mission and that he has not created one thing in vain. Sometimes the Holy One has accomplished his mission by means of [a frog, by means of a gnat,<sup><xref rid="fn662">8</xref></sup> by means of a wasp, or by means of] a scorpion. R. Hanan of Sepphoris said:<sup><xref rid="fn663">9</xref></sup> There is a story about a certain scorpion that went to carry out &#x003C;the Holy One&#x2019;s&#x003E; mission (to sting a certain person) beyond the Jordan; so the Holy One summoned a certain frog for him, and he crossed over upon it. Then that scorpion went and stung &#x003C;the&#x003E; person so that he died. &#x003C;There is&#x003E; also a story about a certain reaper who stood and reaped in the valley of Beth-Tofah. When burning heat came, he took grass &#x003C;and&#x003E; &#x007B;cut&#x007D; [tied] it on his head. &#x003C;When&#x003E; a certain mighty serpent came at him, he killed it. A certain &#x003C;snake&#x003E; charmer passed by him. He saw the slain serpent. He said to him: who killed that serpent? He said to him I &#x003C;did&#x003E;. He looked at the grass on his head. He said to him: Will you remove the grass from your head? He told him: Yes. When he had removed it, he said to him: Are you able to remove this snake with this staff? He told him: Yes. He did so. &#x003C;When&#x003E; he drew near to it, he had not succeeded in touching it, before he shed his body parts one by one.</p>
<p>R. Jannay was sitting as a judge as the gate of his city, &#x003C;when&#x003E; he saw a serpent hissing and coming toward the city. When they would secure against it in one place, it would go to another. He said: It seems to me that this &#x003C;serpent&#x003E; is on its way to carry out its mission. When it entered the city, a rumor spread in the city: &#x003C;Did you hear about&#x003E; So-and-so ben So-and-so? A serpent has bitten him, and he is dead.</p>
<p>There is a story about two people who were walking on the way. One who could see, and one was blind. They sat down to eat. They reached out their hands for the herbs of the field and ate. The one who could see became blind, and the one who had been blind became sighted. They did not move from there until the former was being supported by the latter whom he had been supporting.</p>
<p>There is a story about a certain person who was going from the land of Israel to Babylon.<sup><xref rid="fn664">10</xref></sup> While he was eating, he saw two birds fighting with each other. One of them killed its companion. Then going to get an herb, [it placed it on its mouth,] and made it live again. That person (the one who saw what had happened) went and took the very herb that had fallen from the bird. Then he went to make the dead live with it. When he arrived at the Ladder of Tyre,<sup><xref rid="fn665">11</xref></sup> he found a dead lion lying in the open. He touched the herb to its mouth and made it live. The lion got up and ate him. The proverb says: Do not do good to the evil, and evil will not happen to you.<sup><xref rid="fn666">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a story of Shihin (a town near Sepphoris) about a certain blind person who went down to bathe in the waters in a cave. He happened upon the well of Miriam, immersed &#x003C;himself in it&#x003E;, and was healed. Titus the Wicked entered the interior of the Holy of Holies.<sup><xref rid="fn667">13</xref></sup> When he had reviled and blasphemed, he stood up and slashed the veil. Then he took a Torah scroll and brought it out. Next he unrolled it; and bringing two whores, he transgressed upon them. Then he drew his sword to cut up the &#x007B;veil&#x007D; [book]. A miracle took place in that blood began to spew forth from it. He began to boast, saying that he had killed himself (i.e. the Torah).<sup><xref rid="fn668">14</xref></sup> He began to become bolder and bolder. When he reached the sea, the sea began to grow more and more stormy. He said: The God of these people only has power in the sea. When Pharaoh arose, he drowned him in the sea, and Sisera as well.<sup><xref rid="fn669">15</xref></sup> Now if he would, let there be dry land between him and me. Then let us see who overcomes. The Holy one said: O you wicked son of wickedness, son of the Nimrod the Wicked, I am sending against you a tiny creature, the least of my creatures, to eradicate you from the world. A gnat entered his nose and he died an unnatural death. Why is it named a base creature? Because it takes in but does not excrete.</p>
<p>Moreover, sometimes it is by means of a hornet &#x003C;that God&#x2019;s will is carried out&#x003E;. Thus it is written (in Exod. 23:28): <small>I WILL SEND THE HORNET BEFORE YOU &#x003C;TO DRIVE OUT THE HIVITES, THE CANAANITES, AND THE HITTITES FROM BEFORE YOU&#x003E;</small>. Our masters have said: When the Holy One sent the hornet before Israel to kill the Amorites, see what was written about them (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES</small> [<small>BEFORE THEM, WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT AND WHO WERE AS STRONG AS THE OAKS</small>;] <small>&#x003C;I DESTROYED THEIR FRUIT ABOVE AND THEIR ROOTS BELOW&#x003E;</small>. It entered one&#x2019;s right eye and poured out its poison in it. Then &#x003C;that person&#x003E; burst open and dropped dead. This indeed is the way of the Holy One: to carry out his missions by means of small things against all who vaunt themselves against him. He sends them a small creature to exact punishment from them, in order to inform them that their might &#x003C;comes&#x003E; only from him. Also in the world to come the Holy One is going to exact punishment from the star-worshiping peoples by means of small things. It is so stated (in Is. 7:18&#x2013;19): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS ON THAT DAY THAT THE</small> [<small>LORD</small>] <small>SHALL WHISTLE FOR THE FLY THAT IS AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE RIVERS OF EGYPT AND FOR THE BEE THAT IS</small> &#x007B;<small>AT THE END OF</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN</small>] <small>HIS LAND OF ASSYRIA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn670">16</xref></sup> <small>THEY ALL SHALL COME&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>6.2 Numbers 19:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Question:<sup><xref rid="fn671">17</xref></sup> Are those of the house of Israel obligated to abstain from anything unclean, as stated (in Lev. 20:25): <small>SO YOU SHALL MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CLEAN ANIMAL AND THE UNCLEAN, ALSO BETWEEN THE UNCLEAN BIRD AND THE CLEAN</small>? Now it is not a question of [something] unclean that is forbidden, but even of &#x003C;the&#x003E; utensils by which something unclean has been cooked. It is forbidden for Israel to cook with them, until each and every piece has been purged, as stated (in Numb. 31:23): <small>EVERY</small>[<small>THING</small>] <small>THAT WILL WITHSTAND THE FIRE</small> [<small>YOU SHALL PASS THROUGH THE FIRE, AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN</small>]. For example, the spits and the grills<sup><xref rid="fn672">18</xref></sup> which star worshipers have used are not permitted, until thay have come into the fire, as we are taught (in &#x2018;<italic><small>AZ</small></italic> 5:12): <small>IN THE CASE OF A SKEWER AND A GRILL, ONE MAKES THEM WHITE HOT IN THE FIRE</small>. For how long does one make them white hot? [R. Mani says:] Until their scaling drops off.<sup><xref rid="fn673">19</xref></sup> In the case of pots, kettles (<italic>qumqemasin</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn674">20</xref></sup> and heating vessels which you use for boiling,<sup><xref rid="fn675">21</xref></sup> one must purge them by the flame through boiling.<sup><xref rid="fn676">22</xref></sup> Moreover, although in the case of kettles (<italic>qumqemasin</italic>) it is not customarily to cook in one, sometimes when one does not find the &#x003C;proper&#x003E; vessel, one does cook in them accidentally. In the case of a pot into which the head of a free-flying sparrow cannot enter, one need not purge it, as stated (in &#x2018;<italic>AZ</italic> 38b. [bar.]): When &#x003C;concerning&#x003E; the date solids of star worshipers &#x007B;i.e., refuse of dates from which they have made beer and which they mix with hot water&#x007D;, if they are heated in a large pot, &#x003C;the pot&#x003E; is forbidden. &#x003C;When heated&#x003E; in a small pot, it is permitted. And which pot is small? [R. Jannay said:] Any into which the head of a free-flying sparrow cannot enter. But how does one cleanse them with hot water?<sup><xref rid="fn677">23</xref></sup> [R. Huna said:] One puts a small pot within a large pot. And what about a large pot? &#x003C;One treats it&#x003E; like a caldron which belonged to &#x007B;Mar&#x007D; [Rav] &#x2018;Uqba. He made a rim of dough for it, filled it with water, and boiled it.<sup><xref rid="fn678">24</xref></sup> boiling water would overflow the top and leave no part uncleansed. Also in the case of a spoon, it is necessary to place it inside of a caldron, and it is purged. In the case of plates, one uses them in a second utensil. If one has taken &#x003C;water&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn679">25</xref></sup> from a caldron and poured it over them, it is considered all right; but although one has purged them, it is necessary to immerse them in the stream. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn680">26</xref></sup> And they all need immersion in a forty-<italic>se&#x2019;ah</italic> ritual bath (<italic>miqwah</italic>) for Israel to use them again. Where are these things shown? Rabba said: Where Scripture has said (in Numb. 31:23): <small>EVERY</small> [<small>THING</small>] <small>THAT WILL WITHSTAND THE FIRE YOU SHALL PASS THROUGH THE FIRE, AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN. HOWEVER, IT SHALL BE PURIFIED IN THE WATERS OF MENSTRUAL PURIFICATION&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn681">27</xref></sup> The text has added another cleansing. Moreover, Bar Qappara has taught: It is stated by implication (ibid.): <small>HOWEVER, IT SHALL BE PURIFIED IN THE WATERS OF MENSTRUAL PURIFICATION</small>. I might infer that this &#x003C;immersion&#x003E; was needed on the third and &#x007B;fourth&#x007D; [seventh] day.<sup><xref rid="fn682">28</xref></sup> The Scripture<sup><xref rid="fn683">29</xref></sup> says (ibid.): <small>AND IT SHALL BE CLEAN</small>. If so, what does the text mean by <small>THE WATERS OF MENSTRUAL PURIFICATION</small>? Waters in which the menstruant immerses. And how much [is that]? Forty <italic>se&#x2019;ah.</italic> Rav Nahman said: Rabbah bar Abbuha said: Even new vessels which one acquires in the market from a star worshiper need immersion, [since] old [ones], when one makes them white hot, are like new ones. Even so, they need immersion. Rav Sheshet raised an objection for him: Even if that is so, &#x201C;implement&#x201D; is undefined.<sup><xref rid="fn684">30</xref></sup> Rabba said: Vessels for eating are the ones being spoken of in the parashah, since it is written (in Numb. 31:23): <small>EVERY</small> [<small>THING</small>] <small>THAT WILL WITHSTAND</small> (literally: <small>COME INTO</small>) <small>THE FIRE&#x2026;</small>. &#x007B;And so&#x007D; Rav Isaac bar Joseph [bought] a certain vessel &#x003C;made&#x003E; of fresh ordure.<sup><xref rid="fn685">31</xref></sup> He planned to immerse it. One of the masters named R. Jacob said to him: Thus did R. Johanan say: Vessels of metal are the ones being spoken of in the parashah, since it is so stated (in Numb. 31:22): <small>SURELY THE GOLD AND THE SILVER</small>. &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; But these are new vessels of clay. New ones need no immersion. Old ones are not purgeable, as we find in the case of the sin offering (according to Lev. 6:21 [28]): <small>BUT AN EARTHEN VESSEL IN WHICH IT</small> (the sin offering) <small>WAS BOILED SHALL BE BROKEN</small>.</p>
<p>However, it is necessary to say: These are plates with a glaze,<sup><xref rid="fn686">32</xref></sup> which they use in boiling. Is there any purging for them or not; for while they were earthen vessels originally, one coated them with glaze? That glaze seal is a shield, so that the clay does not absorb, because glaze is &#x003C;like&#x003E; metal, and purging is sufficient for it. Or if there is no shield, the clay does absorb &#x003C;impurities&#x003E;, and there is no remedy for it. Come, hear what they asked Meremar concerning leaven on Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn687">33</xref></sup> [This is the case with glazed vessels: Is&#x007D; [In the case of glazed vessels, is] there any purging for them, and is it permitted to use them on Passover or not? When there are cracks in them, we certainly have no question that this &#x003C;glaze&#x003E; does absorb &#x003C;impurities&#x003E; where the cracks are. In the case of green &#x003C;glaze&#x003E;, there is certainly no question for us &#x003C;about its absorption&#x003E; because it (the glaze) contains alum; while a white or black &#x003C;glaze&#x003E; certainly does present us with a question. He said to them: We &#x007B;argued&#x007D; [saw] regarding them, that when they put hot &#x003C;water&#x003E; in them, their outside surfaces sweat.<sup><xref rid="fn688">34</xref></sup> From this you may infer that they are absorbent. They are therefore comparable to common earthen vessels. These words &#x003C;only apply&#x003E; with reference to leaven during Passover and with reference to usage by star worshipers who would use them (the vessels) for boiling. With reference to libation wine,<sup><xref rid="fn689">35</xref></sup> however, when it is used cold, a green glaze is forbidden because it contains alum. As for black and white &#x003C;glazes, if&#x003E; there are cracks in it, it is forbidden; if there are no cracks in it, it is generally sufficient with a dabbling. [Why?] It is comparable to a vessel of metal, for it is established for us as a law (<italic>halakhah</italic>) as Rav Zevid said: Those vessels with a white or black glaze are permitted; green ones are forbidden. Also if there are cracks in them, they are all forbidden. And this is the law (<italic>halakhah</italic>).</p>
<title>6.3 Numbers 19:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2):<sup><xref rid="fn690">36</xref></sup> [<small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH &#x003C;THAT THE LORD HAS COMMANDED, SAYING: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003E; AND LET THEM BRING YOU A RED COW WITHOUT BLEMISH</small>. Let our master instruct us: In the case of a cow with black horns and hoofs, is it correct that it would be permissible (<italic>kesherah</italic>)? Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Parah</italic> 2:2): <small>A COW WITH BLACK HORN AND HOOFS &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; IS VALID</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn691">37</xref></sup> but all &#x003C;the rest&#x003E; of it must be red. They told a story that one year they went around seeking a red cow without blemish.<sup><xref rid="fn692">38</xref></sup> They came to a certain star worshiper and found one with him. They said to him: Sell it to us. When he saw that they needed it greatly, he began to raise the price for it. They said to him: How much? He said to them: A hundred gold coins.<sup><xref rid="fn693">39</xref></sup> They said to him: Take &#x003C;the money&#x003E; and bring out &#x003C;the cow&#x003E;. So they gave him &#x003C;the money&#x003E;. He entered his house<sup><xref rid="fn694">40</xref></sup> and came out. He said to them: I am not selling unless you pay me more. They paid him fifty coins in addition; but again he entered his house and came out. &#x003C;So he did not sell,&#x003E; until they gave him three hundred gold coins. He said to himself: I shall mock &#x003C;these&#x003E; Jews. He went in, took a yoke, and let it rest on &#x003C;the cow&#x003E; neck all night. In the morning he brought it out to them. When they saw it, they knew that a yoke had been on it, for they saw that its eyes were rolling. When they would come to place a yoke upon it, its eyes would roll and stare at the yoke. When they saw its signs<sup><xref rid="fn695">41</xref></sup> that it had had a yoke on it, they said to him: Give us &#x003C;the&#x003E; gold coins, for we are not taking it from you, even with no payment. We do not need it. When he saw that they had looked at it and had known that a yoke had been on it, he gave them their money and began to praise the Holy One. Then he said: Blessed be your God, who has set wisdom and knowledge within you. He gave them back the gold coins and strangled himself (at the end of a rope). &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to inform you that it is a scriptural commandment for one to bring only a red cow. Where is it shown? From what is written on the subject (in Numb. 19:2): <small>AND LET THEM BRING YOU A RED COW WITHOUT BLEMISH, IN WHICH THERE IS NO DEFECT, ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO YOKE</small>.]</p>
<title>6.4 Numbers 19:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2): <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. This text is related (to Job 14:4): <small>WHO CAN PRODUCE SOMETHING CLEAN OUT OF SOMETHING UNCLEAN</small>? <small>IS IT NOT &#x003C;THE HOLY&#x003E; ONE</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn696">42</xref></sup> &#x003C;Who&#x003E;, for example, &#x003C;produced&#x003E; Abraham out of Terah, Hezekiah out of Ahaz, Josiah out of Amon, Mordecai out of Shimei, Israel out of the nations of the world, [the world to come out of this world].<sup><xref rid="fn697">43</xref></sup> So who did so? Who commanded so? And who decreed so? Was it not one being? Was it not the One Unequaled in the World (i.e., the Holy One)? We have learned elsewhere [(in <italic>Neg.</italic> 8:2):<sup><xref rid="fn698">44</xref></sup> <small>IF ONE HAS A BRIGHT SPOT THE SIZE OF A BEAN</small>, he is unclean &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn699">45</xref></sup>; <small>IF IT HAS BURST OUT ALL OVER HIM, HE IS CLEAN</small>. Who did so? Who decreed so? Who commanded so? Was it not the One Unequaled in the World? We have learned elsewhere] (in <italic>Hul</italic>. 4:3): <small>IN THE CASE OF THE WOMAN WHOSE FETUS DIED WITHIN HER BELLY, IF</small> &#x007B;<small>SHE</small>&#x007D; [<small>A MIDWIFE</small>] <small>INSERTED HER HAND &#x003C;INTO THE WOMB&#x003E; AND TOUCHED IT, THE MIDWIFE IS UNCLEAN FOR SEVEN DAYS, BUT THE WOMAN REMAINS CLEAN UNTIL THE FETUS COMES FORTH</small>. And so it is that while the dead person is in the house, the house is clean; when he comes forth from it, he makes it unclean. Who did this? Was it not the One Unequaled in the World? We have learned elsewhere (in <italic>Parah</italic> 4:4; <italic>Hul</italic>. 29b): <small>ALL WHO ARE OCCUPIED WITH THE &#x003C;RITE OF THE RED&#x003E; COW FROM BEGINNING TO END RENDER &#x003C;THEIR&#x003E; CLOTHES UNCLEAN</small>, while the &#x003C;cow&#x003E; herself makes &#x003C;what is unclean&#x003E; clean. Thus the Holy One has said: I have enacted a statute for you; I have issued a decree&#x0021; So you are not authorized to transgress against my decree.</p>
<title>6.5 Numbers 19:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2): <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. R. Tanhum bar Hanila&#x2019;i opened (with Ps. 12:7 [6]): <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn700">46</xref></sup> Are <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD</small> &#x003C;true&#x003E; <small>SAYINGS</small>, but the sayings of flesh and blood not &#x003C;true&#x003E; sayings? Now by universal custom, when a king of flesh and blood enters a province, the inhabitants of the province praise<sup><xref rid="fn701">47</xref></sup> him; and their praise is pleasing to him. He says to them: Tomorrow I am building bath houses<sup><xref rid="fn702">48</xref></sup> for you. Tomorrow I am building baths for you. Tomorrow I am bringing in the water itself (literally: true water) for you. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; he goes to sleep and never gets up. Where is he &#x003C;now&#x003E;? Where are his promises (literally: statements)? The Holy One, however, is not like this. Rather (in Jer. 10:10): <small>BUT THE LORD IS A TRUE GOD</small>. And why is he <small>TRUE</small>? R. Abbin said: Because (ibid, cont.:) <small>HE IS A LIVING GOD AND AN EVERLASTING KING</small>.</p>
<title>6.6 Numbers 19:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2): <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. (Ps. 12:7 [6]:) <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: We find that the Torah has twisted two or three words in the Torah, so as not to bring forth something unclean from his (i.e., the Holy One&#x2019;s) mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn703">49</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Gen. 7:2): <small>OF EVERY CLEAN BEAST YOU SHALL TAKE SEVEN PAIRS, MALES AND THEIR MATES, AND OF THE BEAST WHICH IS NOT CLEAN, &#x003C;TWO, A MALE AND ITS MATE&#x003E;</small>. So it is not written: &#x201C;Of the unclean beast.&#x201D; R. Judan said: When he came to introduce the signs of an unclean beast, he would always begin with the signs of purity. It is not written here (in Lev. 11:4): &#x201C;The camel, because it does not have a cloven hoof,&#x201D; but <small>&#x003C;THE CAMEL&#x003E; BECAUSE IT CHEWS ITS CUD &#x003C;BUT DOES NOT HAVE A CLOVEN HOOF&#x003E;</small>. [It is not written here (in Lev. 11:6): &#x201C;The hare, because it does not have a hoof,&#x201D; but <small>&#x003C;THE HARE&#x003E;, BECAUSE IT CHEWS ITS CUD &#x003C;BUT DOES NOT HAVE A CLOVEN HOOF&#x003E;</small>. It is not written (in Lev. 11:7): &#x201C;The pig, because it does not chew its cud,&#x201D; but <small>&#x003C;THE PIG&#x003E;, BECAUSE IT HAS A CLOVEN HOOF &#x003C;AND IS CLEFT FOOTED, BUT DOES NOT CHEW ITS CUD&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.7 Numbers 19:1ff, Part VII</title>
<p>[(Ps. 12:7 [61], cont:) <small>REFINED SEVENFOLD</small>.] R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: The infants who lived in the days of David, &#x003C;even&#x003E; before they had a gotten a taste of sin, knew how to interpret the Torah with forty-nine reasons for declaring an object unclean and forty-nine reasons for declaring an object clean.<sup><xref rid="fn704">50</xref></sup> So David prayed for them and said (in Ps. 12:8 [7]): <small>YOU, O LORD, WILL KEEP THEM; YOU WILL GUARD EACH &#x003C;OF THEM&#x003E; FROM THIS GENERATION UNTO ETERNITY</small>. (ibid.:) <small>YOU, O LORD, WILL KEEP THEM</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; watch over their instruction in their hearts. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU WILL GUARD EACH &#x003C;OF THEM&#x003E; FROM THIS GENERATION UNTO ETERNITY</small>. [From the generation] which is worthy of destruction. Moreover, after all this glory, they went out to war and fell, [because there were slanderers<sup><xref rid="fn705">51</xref></sup> among them.] This is what David says (in Ps. 57:5 [4]): <small>MY SOUL IS IN THE MIDST OF LIONS, I LIE DOWN AMONG THOSE WHO ARE AFLAME, THE CHILDREN OF ADAM WHOSE TEETH ARE SPEARS AND DARTS, AND WHOSE TONGUE IS A SHARP SWORD</small>. (ibid.:) <small>MY SOUL IS IN THE MIDST OF LIONS</small>.

These are the Ziphites, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 54:2 [1]): <small>WHEN THE ZIPHITES CAME AND SAID TO SAUL: IS NOT DAVID HIDING AMONG US</small> &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;? At that time David said (in Ps. 57:6 [5]): <small>BE EXALTED, O GOD, ABOVE THE HEAVENS</small>. Remove your Divine Presence from among them. The generation of Ahab, however, were all worshipers of idols; yet because there were no slanderers among them, they went out to war and won.<sup><xref rid="fn708">54</xref></sup> That &#x003C;freedom from informers&#x003E; is what &#x003C;enabled&#x003E; Obadiah to say to Elijah (in I Kings 18:13): <small>HAS IT NOT BEEN TOLD TO MY LORD WHAT I DID &#x003C;WHEN JEZEBEL SLEW THE PROPHETS, HOW I HID A HUNDRED PROPHETS OF THE LORD&#x003E; &#x2026;, AND PROVIDED THEM WITH BREAD AND WATER</small>? If bread &#x003C;is mentioned&#x003E;, why &#x003C;mention&#x003E; water? Simply because it was more difficult to bring them the water than the bread.<sup><xref rid="fn709">55</xref></sup> Even though Elijah made his proclamation<sup><xref rid="fn710">56</xref></sup> on Mount Carmel and said (in vs. 22): <small>I AM THE ONLY PROPHET OF THE LORD LEFT</small>, and even though all the people knew it, they did not expose<sup><xref rid="fn711">57</xref></sup> him to the king.</p>
<title>6.8 Numbers 19:1ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>R. Samuel b. R. Nahman said: They said to the serpent: Why is it that you are found among the among the fences?

They said to it: Why is it that, when all the &#x003C;other&#x003E; animals bite, they do not kill; but when you bite, you do kill? It said to them (in Eccl. 10:11): <small>IF A SNAKE BITES WITHOUT &#x003C;BEING UNDER A SPELL, THE OWNER OF THE TONGUE</small> (i.e., one able to charm the snake) <small>HAS NO ADVANTAGE</small>.&#x003E; Is it possible for me to do anything without me being told from on high? Then why is it that, when you bite a one limb, all the limbs feel &#x003C;the pain&#x003E;? It said to them: Are you asking me?

<p>Why is the slandering informer named &#x201C;third&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn715">61</xref></sup> Because &#x003C;such a slanderer&#x003E; kills three people: the one who speaks it, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom it is spoken.<sup><xref rid="fn716">62</xref></sup> In the days of Saul it killed four: Doeg, who spoke it<sup><xref rid="fn717">63</xref></sup>; Saul, who received it<sup><xref rid="fn718">64</xref></sup>; Ahimelech, about whom it was spoken<sup><xref rid="fn719">65</xref></sup>; [and Abner ben Ner]. Now why was Abner ben Ner slain? Joshua [b. Levi] said: &#x003C;He was slain&#x003E; because he gave precedence to his own name over the name of David. This is what is written (in II Sam. 3:12): <small>THEN ABNER SENT MESSENGERS UNTO DAVID WHERE HE WAS</small>, [<small>SAYING</small>]: <small>TO WHOM DOES THE LAND BELONG</small>? &#x003C;In the message&#x003E; he wrote: From Abner to David.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn720">66</xref></sup> R.

Our masters have said: &#x003C;He was slain&#x003E; because he did not wait for Saul to be reconciled<sup><xref rid="fn721">67</xref></sup> with David, where it is stated (in I Sam. 24:12 [11], with David addressing Saul): <small>SEE, MY FATHER, SEE &#x003C;THE CORNER OF YOUR CLOAK IN MY HAND; FOR WHEN I CUT OFF THE CORNER OF YOUR CLOAK, I DID NOT KILL YOU&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;Saul&#x003E; said to him: Abner, what do you want &#x003C;to understand&#x003E;from the cloak? You said: It was caught on a thorn. When &#x003C;David&#x003E; came toward wagons around the camp, he said to him (in I Sam. 26:14): <small>ABNER, WILL YOU NOT ANSWER</small>? As for the corner of the cloak, you said was caught on a thorn. Were &#x003C;the&#x003E; spear and &#x003C;the&#x003E; water jar (of I Sam. 26:11) caught on a thorn? There are also some who say: &#x003C;Abner was slain&#x003E; because he had the power to protest about Nob, the city of priests, but did not protest.</p>

<p>[(Ps. 12:7 [61]:) <small>REFINED SEVENFOLD</small>.] R.

<title>6.10 Numbers 19:1ff, Part X</title>
<p>R. Isaac began (with Eccl. 7:23): <small>ALL THIS I TESTED WITH WISDOM</small>. It is written (in I Kings 5:9 [4:29]): <small>SO GOD GAVE SOLOMON WISDOM</small> [ &#x2026; <small>AS VAST AS THE SAND WHICH IS ON THE SHORE OF THE SEA</small>]. The Rabbis say: He gave him as much wisdom as all Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn730">76</xref></sup> Moreover, R. Levi said: Just as sand is a wall for the sea, so was wisdom a wall for Solomon. The proverb says: If you lack knowledge, what have you gained? If you have gained knowledge, what do you lack? (Prov. 25:28:) <small>A CITY BROKEN INTO WITH NO WALLS IS A PERSON WHO DOES NOT RESTRAIN HIS SPIRIT</small>. [<small>AS A CITY BROKEN INTO</small>, which has no walls, so <small>IS A PERSON WHO DOES NOT RESTRAIN HIS SPIRIT</small>.]</p>
<title>6.11 Numbers 19:1ff, Part XI</title>
<p>(I Kings 5:10 [ 4:30]:) <small>NOW SOLOMON</small>&#x2019;s <small>WISDOM SURPASSED THE WISDOM OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE EAST &#x003C;AND ALL THE WISDOM OF EGYPT&#x003E;</small>. [What was the wisdom of the peoples of the East?]<sup><xref rid="fn731">77</xref></sup> &#x003C;It refers to the ones&#x003E; who knew about astrology and were astute at divination (from birds). &#x007B;In the language of Ishmael they read divination from birds.&#x007D; Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: I like three things about the Persians:</p>
<ol>
<li>They do not kiss on the mouth, but only on the hand;</li>
<li>When they cut meat, they cut only with a knife and not with the mouth, and</li>
<li>When they take counsel, they take it only in the field.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore stated (in Gen. 31:4): <small>SO JACOB SENT AND CALLED RACHEL AND LEAH TO THE FIELD WHERE HIS FLOCK WAS</small>. (I Kings 5:10 [4:30], cont.:) <small>AND ALL THE WISDOM OF THE EGYPTIANS</small>. What was the wisdom of Egypt? You find that when Solomon wanted to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Necho and said to him: Send me craftsmens &#x003C;to work&#x003E; for a wage, for I want to build the Temple. What did he do? He gathered all his astrologers<sup><xref rid="fn732">78</xref></sup> [and said to them]: Foresee which people are going to die this year and send them to him. When they came to Solomon, he foresaw through the Holy Spirit that they would die during that year. He &#x003C;therefore&#x003E; gave them shrouds and sent them &#x003C;back&#x003E; to &#x003C;Pharaoh&#x003E;. He sent to him: saying: Do you not have shrouds to bury your dead?

<p>(I Kings 5:11 [4:31]:) <small>FOR HE WAS WISER THAN ANYONE</small> (literally: <small>WISER THAN ADAM</small>). What was his wisdom? You find that, when the Holy One wanted to create the first Adam, he consulted with the ministering Angels. He said to them (in Gen. 1:26): <small>LET US MAKE HUMANKIND</small> (<italic>Adam</italic>) <small>IN OUR IMAGE</small>. They said to him (in Ps. 8:5[4]): <small>WHAT IS A HUMAN THAT YOU ARE MINDFUL OF HIM, &#x003C;AND A CHILD OF ADAM THAT YOU SHOULD THINK OF HIM&#x003E;</small>? He said to them: [Since I want to create Adam in my world,] his wisdom [shall be] greater than yours. Immediately he made all cattle, wild beasts, and fowl pass before them. He said to them: What are the names of these &#x003C;beings&#x003E;? They, however, did not know. When he had created the first Adam, he made them pass before him. He said to him: What are the names of these &#x003C;beings&#x003E;? He said: It is fitting to call this one an ox, this one a lion, this one a horse, and so on for all of them. It is so stated (in Gen. 2:20): <small>SO ADAM RECITED NAMES FOR ALL THE CATTLE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn733">79</xref></sup>&#x2026; He said to him: You, what is your name? Adam said to him: Adam, because I was created out of the ground (<italic>adamah</italic>). The Holy One said to him: I, what is my name? He said to him: The <small>LORD</small>, because you are lord over all creatures, namely as written (in Is. 42:8): <small>I AM YHWH</small> (<small>THE LORD</small>) <small>THAT IS MY NAME</small>, which the first Adam gave me.<sup><xref rid="fn734">80</xref></sup> [That is my name, the one which I have agreed to &#x003C;for use&#x003E; between me and the nations of the world.]</p>

The Egyptians said: Has this slave come to rule over us for any reason but because of his wisdom? What did they do to him? They brought seventy tablets<sup><xref rid="fn736">82</xref></sup> and wrote on them in seventy tongues. Then when they cast them<sup><xref rid="fn737">83</xref></sup> before him.

Because of (&#x2018;<italic>al</italic>) the tallest among the trees (the cedar) and through the lowest of the low (the hyssop). Through (according to Lev. 14:4) <small>CEDAR WOOD</small>, [<small>CRIMSON STUFF</small>,] <small>AND HYSSOP</small>. It is simply because he had exalted himself like the cedar, that he was stricken with leprosy. As soon as he humbled himself like the hyssop, he was therefore cured through hyssop.</p>
<title>6.15 Numbers 19:1ff, Part XV</title>
<p>(I Kings 5:13 [4:33], cont.:) <small>HE ALSO SPOKE WITH</small>/<small>CONCERNING</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al</italic>) <small>THE CATTLE AND ON THE FOWL</small>. Is it possible that &#x003C;a person&#x003E; would speak with cattle and with fowl? Rather &#x003C;the passage is concerned with&#x003E; why the cattle are permitted &#x003C;as food&#x003E; with &#x003C;the cutting of&#x003E; two organs<sup><xref rid="fn742">88</xref></sup> (the gullet and the windpipe); but the fowl, with &#x003C;the cutting of&#x003E; one organ (i.e., the gullet or the windpipe).<sup><xref rid="fn743">89</xref></sup> It is because cattle were created from the dry land, as stated (in Gen. 1:14): <small>LET THE EARTH BRING FORTH THE LIVING CREATURES AFTER ITS KIND, CATTLE, CREEPING THINGS, AND THE BEAST OF THE EARTH AFTER ITS KIND</small>. But in regard to fowl, one text says &#x003C;they came&#x003E; from the dry land, while another text says &#x003C;they came&#x003E; from the sea. &#x003C;The text stating fowls came&#x003E; from the dry land is what is written (in Gen. 2:19): <small>SO FROM THE GROUND THE LORD GOD FORMED EVERY BEAST OF THE FIELD AND EVERY FOWL OF THE HEAVENS</small>. The other text says (in Gen. 1:20): <small>LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH SWARMS OF LIVING CREATURES AND THE FOWL FLYING ABOVE THE EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn744">90</xref></sup> Bar Qappara said: They were created from the mud which is in the sea. R. Abbin said the name of R. Samuel [of Cappadocia]: The feet of the cock resemble the scaly skin<sup><xref rid="fn745">91</xref></sup> of the nuna.<sup><xref rid="fn746">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>(I Kings 5:13 [4:33], cont.:) <small>AND WITH</small>/<small>CONCERNING</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al</italic>) <small>THE CREEPING THINGS</small>. Is it possible that one would speak with a creeping thing? Solomon simply said: What is the reason that in the case of the eight reptiles which are in the Torah, one is culpable for hunting or injuring them (on the Sabbath)<sup><xref rid="fn747">93</xref></sup>; but in the case of the rest of the reptiles and creeping things, one is exempt?<sup><xref rid="fn748">94</xref></sup> For the reason that they (i.e. the former) have skins.<sup><xref rid="fn749">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>(I Kings 5:13 [4:33]:) <small>AND WITH</small>/<small>CONCERNING</small> (&#x2018;<italic>al</italic>) <small>THE FISH</small>. Is it possible that one would so speak? Solomon merely said: For what reason do cattle, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughtering, while fish do not require ritual slaughtering? Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya taught in Tyre with respect to fish, that they do require ritual slaughtering. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him: On what basis did you decide this? He said to them: From here (in Gen. 1:20): <small>LET THE WATERS SWARM WITH LIVING CREATURES, AND LET THE FOWL FLY</small>. Just as fowl require ritual slaughtering so do the fish require ritual slaughtering. He said to them (i.e., those standing by): Lay him down to receive lashes. He said to him: Shall a person who speaks the biblical word be lashed? He said to him: You did not decide well. He said to him: On what basis? He said to him: From here (in Numb. 11:22): <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FLOCKS AND HERDS TO SLAUGHTER FOR THEM</small>? <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FISH IN THE SEA TO GATHER FOR THEM</small>? The former require ritual slaughtering, while the latter &#x003C;is taken&#x003E; through gathering. He said to him: Give him your beating, for there is benefit in receiving lashes.</p>
<p>And again did Jacob the man of Kefar Nibburayya teach in Tyre, &#x003C;this time&#x003E; with respect to a son of Israel, who came upon a foreign woman and had her bear him a son, that he should be circumcised on the Sabbath. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him. On what basis do you hold this? He said to him: [From this which is written] (in Numb. 1:18) <small>THEN THEY REGISTERED THEIR LINEAGES ACCORDING TO THEIR FAMILIES BY THEIR ANCESTRAL HOUSES</small>. He said to them (i.e., those standing by): Lay him down to receive lashes. He said to him: Shall a person who speaks the biblical word be lashed? He said to him: You did not decide well. He said to him: Where is it shown? He said to him: Lie down and listen. He said to him: If one of the gentiles came to you in order to become a proselyte on the Sabbath Day or on the Day of Atonement, would you profane the Sabbath on account of him or not? He said to him: One does not profane the Sabbath [or the Day of Atonement] for him but only for a child of Israel. He said to him: On what basis do you hold this? He said to him (in Ezra 10:3): <small>SO NOW LET US MAKE A COVENANT WITH OUR GOD TO PUT AWAY ALL</small> &#x007B;<small>FOREIGN</small>&#x007D; <small>WIVES AND &#x003C;ANYONE&#x003E; BORN OF THEM&#x2026;</small>. He said to him: Would you lash me on the basis of a non-Mosaic text? He said to him: It is written (ibid.): <small>LET IT BE DONE</small> &#x007B;<small>THROUGH</small>&#x007D; [<small>ACCORDING TO</small>] <small>THE TORAH</small>. He said to him: From which &#x003C; piece of&#x003E; Torah? He said to him: From that of R. Johanan, when he said in the name of R.

(Deut. 7:4:) <small>BECAUSE THEY WILL TURN YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM FOLLOWING ME&#x2026;</small>. Your child that comes from an Israelite woman is called &#x201C;your child&#x201D;; but that which comes from a foreign woman is called, not &#x201C;your child,&#x201D; but &#x201C;her child.&#x201D; He said to him: Give him your beating, for there is benefit in receiving lashes. Solomon &#x003C;meant when he&#x003E; said (in Eccl. 7:23): <small>&#x003C;ALL THIS I TESTED WITH WISDOM&#x003E;:</small> About all these things I have knowledge; but in the case of the parashah on the Red Heifer, I have investigated it, inquired into it, and examined it.

<p>[Another interpretation (of Eccl. 8:1): <small>WHO IS LIKE THE WISE PERSON</small>?

R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon ben Menasya: The round of the first Adam&#x2019;s heel outshone the sphere of the sun, and you should not be surprised over this. By universal custom, when someone makes two salvers,<sup><xref rid="fn753">99</xref></sup> one for himself and one for a steward, whose does he make more beautiful? Is it not his own? Similarly, the first Adam was created for his own use, and the sphere of the sun was for the use of mortals. Is it not all the more true that the round of the &#x003C;first Adam&#x2019;s&#x003E; heel would outshine the sphere of the sun? And if his heel were like that, how much brighter was the countenance<sup><xref rid="fn754">100</xref></sup> of his face.</p>
<p>R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: the Holy One joined together thirteen bridal canopies for the first Adam in the Garden of Eden, as written (in Ezek. 28:13): <small>YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD; EVERY STONE THAT IS PRECIOUS WAS YOUR COVERING</small>: &#x003C;(1) <small>CARNELIAN</small>, (2) <small>CHRYSOLITE, AND</small> (3) <small>MOONSTONE</small>, (4) <small>BERYL</small>, (5) <small>ONYX AND</small>, (6) <small>JASPER</small>, (7) <small>SAPPHIRE</small>, (8) <small>TURQUOISE, AND</small> (9) <small>EMERALD, AND</small> (10) <small>GOLD&#x003E;</small>. Resh Laqish said: Eleven, and the Rabbis say: Ten. But they do not disagree (as to the verse, only over the number of canopies). The one who makes &#x003C;a total of&#x003E; thirteen for him makes (1) <small>EVERY STONE</small>, (2) <small>THAT IS PRECIOUS</small>, and (3) <small>YOUR COVERING</small> &#x003C;to be the extra&#x003E; three. The one who makes &#x003C;a total of&#x003E; eleven for him makes <small>&#x003C;EVERY STONE THAT IS PRECIOUS WAS YOUR COVERING</small> as a whole to be the extra&#x003E; one. The one who makes &#x003C;a total of&#x003E; ten for him does not make &#x003C;these words&#x003E; to be an &#x003C;extra&#x003E; one. Then after all this praise &#x003C;comes&#x003E; (Gen. 3:19): <small>FOR DUST YOU ARE, AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN</small>. (Eccl. 8:1, cont.:) <small>AND THE RADIANCE OF HIS FACE IS CHANGED</small>. When &#x003C;Adam&#x003E; said (in Gen. 3:12): <small>THE WOMAN THAT YOU PUT WITH ME, SHE GAVE ME &#x003C;FRUIT FROM THE TREE, AND I ATE&#x003E;</small>. Even so did the Holy One change his face and drive him from the Garden of Eden, as it is written (in Gen. 3:23): <small>SO THE LORD GOD SENT HIM AWAY FROM THE GARDEN OF EDEN</small>.</p>

I am not lending at interest, because it is written (in Deut. 23:20 [19]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT LEND TO YOUR BROTHER AT INTEREST</small>. Moreover, I am not rearing swine, because a child of Israel is forbidden to rear swine, since we are taught there (in <italic><small>BQ</small></italic> 7:7): <small>NO ONE MAY RAISE SWINE IN ANY PLACE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn764">110</xref></sup> Nor am I sotted with wine, because the four Paschal cups which I drink at Passover has my head tied in knots from Passover to Pentecost.

He said to him: It is the study of Torah that makes my face shine for me. It is so written (in Eccl. 8:1): <small>A PERSON&#x2019;S WISDOM LIGHTS UP HIS FACE</small>. R.

<p>[Another interpretation (of Eccl. 8:1): <small>WHO IS LIKE THE WISE PERSON</small>?

When &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; did not answer, at that time the face of Moses turned yellow (with shame). This is what is written (in Eccl. 8:1): <small>AND THE RADIANCE OF HIS FACE IS CHANGED</small>. Then when the Holy One reached the parashah on the &#x003C;Red&#x003E; Heifer, the Holy One said to him: Moses, &#x003C;when I gave you&#x003E; that saying which I spoke to you (in Lev. 21:1): <small>GO, SPEAK UNTO THE PRIESTS</small>, then you said to me: If one becomes unclean, what means will there be for his purification? &#x003C;At that time&#x003E; I did not answer &#x003C;you&#x003E;. &#x003C;Now&#x003E; this is his purification (in Numb. 19:17): <small>FOR THE UNCLEAN THEY SHALL TAKE SOME ASHES FROM THE BURNING OF THE SIN OFFERING</small> (i.e., the red heifer).</p>

R. Berekhyah in the name of R. Simon proved it from here (in I Chron. 23:13&#x2013;14): <small>THE SONS OF AMRAM: AARON AND MOSES. AARON WAS SEPARATED OUT TO CONSECRATE THE MOST HOLY THINGS, HE AND HIS SONS FOREVER, TO MAKE BURNT OFFERINGS BEFORE THE LORD, &#x003C;&#x2026;,&#x003E; TO PRONOUNCE BLESSINGS IN HIS NAME FOREVER; BUT AS FOR MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD, HIS SONS WERE TO BE NAMED TOGETHER WITH THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small>. Moses is called, <small>THE MAN OF GOD</small>; but as for <small>HIS SONS</small>, it is <small>TOGETHER WITH THE TRIBE OF LEVI</small> that they were to be be named. R. Eleazar b. R.

<p>[(Ps. 99:6, cont.): <small>THEY</small> (i.e., Moses, Aaron, and Samuel) <small>CRIED UNTO THE LORD AND HE ANSWERED THEM</small>. The first cried out and was answered; the second also cried out and was answered. (Ibid., vs. 7): <small>&#x003C;HE SPOKE UNTO THEM&#x003E; IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD</small>. See, we heard about Moses, that he conversed with him in a pillar of cloud, as stated (in Exod. 34:5): <small>THE LORD DESCENDED IN THE CLOUD AND HE STOOD WITH HIM THERE</small>. So also with Aaron, he conversed with him in the cloud, where it is stated (in Numb. 12:5): <small>SO THE LORD CAME DOWN IN</small> a <small>&#x003C;PILLAR OF&#x003E; CLOUD, STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT, &#x003C;AND CALLED AARON AND MIRIAM&#x003E;</small>.

In the case of Aaron, however, I have not heard &#x003C;of his book&#x003E;. It is simply that there is a teaching that this parashah was granted to him, so that it would never budge, neither from him nor from his children, till the end of all the generations.

Aha said in the name of R. Hanina: More than sixty talents of gold were spent on it, for they all were arrogant. We have been taught (in a baraita): Simeon the Just prepared two heifers (during his term of office), but he did not bring out the second on the &#x003C;same&#x003E; causeway where he had brought out the first.<sup><xref rid="fn782">128</xref></sup> Is it for you to say of this just person that he was arrogant? R. Abbin said in the name of R. Eleazar: &#x003C;He did so,&#x003E; because of the dignity of the heifer.</p>
<title>6.26 Numbers 19:1ff, Part XXVI</title>
<p>A certain star worshiper questioned Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay: These things which you do seem like a kind of sorcery.<sup><xref rid="fn783">129</xref></sup> You bring a heifer, burn it, pound it, and take its ashes. Then &#x003C;when&#x003E; one one of you is defiled by a corpse, they sprinkle two or three drops on him, and someone says to him: You are clean. He said to him: Have you ever had the spirit of madness enter you? He told him: No. He said to him: Perhaps you have seen someone into whom the spirit of madness has entered. He told him: Yes. He said to him: So what did you do for him? He said to him: They bring roots and burn them beneath him. Then they sprinkle water on &#x003C;the spirit&#x003E;, and it flees. He said to him: Let your ears hear what you are uttering with your mouth. [Similarly is this spirit an unclean spirit. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 13:2): <small>AND I WILL ALSO REMOVE THE PROPHETS AND THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT FROM THE LAND</small>. They sprinkle the purifying water upon him, and he flees.] After &#x003C;the star worshiper&#x003E; had left, &#x003C;Johanan&#x2019;s&#x003E; disciples said to him: You repelled this one with a &#x003C;mere&#x003E; reed &#x003C;of an answer&#x003E;. What have you to say to us? He said to them: By your lives, a corpse does not defile, nor does water purify. Rather, [as a decree of the Supreme King of Kings], the Holy One has said: I have enacted a statute for you. I have issued a decree, &#x003C;and&#x003E; you are not allowed to transgress against my decree. Thus it is written (in Numb. 19:2): <small>THIS IS THE STATUTE OF THE TORAH</small>. For what reason are all the sacrifices male, while that one is female?<sup><xref rid="fn784">130</xref></sup> R. Ayyevu said: It is comparable to the son of a female slave who defiled a king&#x2019;s palace.<sup><xref rid="fn785">131</xref></sup> The king said: Let his mother come and clean up the excrement. Similarly has the Holy One said: Let a heifer come and atone for the incident of the &#x003C;golden&#x003E; calf.</p>
<title>6.27 Numbers 19:1ff, Part XXVII</title>
<p>(Numb. 19:2:) <small>&#x003C;A RED HEIFER WITHOUT BLEMISH, IN WHICH THERE IS NO DEFECT, ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO YOKE&#x003E;</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>HEIFER</small>. This is Egypt, as stated (in Jer. 46:20): <small>EGYPT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG COW</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn786">132</xref></sup> (Numb. 19:2:) <small>RED</small>. This is Babylon, as stated (in Dan. 2:38): <small>YOU ARE THE HEAD OF &#x003C;RED&#x003E; GOLD</small>. (Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>WITHOUT BLEMISH</small> (<italic>temimah</italic>). This is Media, of which R. Hiyya bar Abba has said: The kings of Media are blameless (<italic>temimim</italic>); and the Holy One had nothing against them, for they only served the idols which they had received from their ancestors. (Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>IN WHICH THERE IS NO DEFECT</small>. This is Greece. When Alexander of Macedon saw Simeon the Just, he stood on his feet and said: Blessed is the God of Simeon the Just. The people of his palace<sup><xref rid="fn787">133</xref></sup> said to him: Do you stand in the presence of a Jew? He said to them: When I go down to battle, I see his image, and I am victorious.</p>
<p>(Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO YOKE</small>. This is Edom (i.e., Rome), since they never took upon themselves the yoke of the Holy One. Moreover, it was not enough for them not to accept it, but they slander and blaspheme by saying (in Ps. 73:25): <small>WHOM DO I HAVE IN HEAVEN</small>&#x2026;?</p>
<p>(Numb. 19:3:) <small>THEN YOU SHALL GIVE IT UNTO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST</small>. [For what reason was &#x003C;the rite&#x003E; performed by Eleazar and not by Aaron? Because he was a partner in the incident of the &#x003C;golden&#x003E; calf.] (Numb. 19:3 cont.:) <small>AND HE</small> (i.e., Eleazar, whose name can be voweled to mean, &#x201C;God helps.&#x201D;) <small>SHALL TAKE IT</small> (i.e., the heifer, which represents Edom and ultimately Rome) <small>OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>, because he is going to drive its prince (i.e., Rome&#x2019;s guardian spirit) out of his encampment (i.e., out of heaven).</p>
<p>(Numb. 19:3 cont.:) <small>AND HE</small> (Eleazar) <small>SHALL SLAUGHTER IT</small> (i.e., Edom-Rome) <small>IN HIS PRESENCE</small> (i.e., of the Holy One). Thus it is stated (in Is. 34:6): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS A SACRIFICE IN BOZRAH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn788">134</xref></sup> <small>A GREAT SLAUGHTER IN THE LAND OF EDOM</small> (i.e., Rome). R. Berekhyah (interpreting the text differently) said: <small>THE SLAUGHTER OF A GREAT ONE</small> (i.e., Rome&#x2019;s guardian spirit) <small>IN EDOM</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 19:5:) <small>AND HE SHALL BURN THE HEIFER</small> (Rome) <small>BEFORE HIS EYES</small>. Thus it is stated (in Dan. 7:11): <small>&#x003C;I LOOKED ON UNTIL THE BEAST WAS SLAIN AND ITS BODY DESTROYED,&#x003E; GIVEN OVER FOR BURNING IN THE FIRE</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 19:5, cont.:) <small>TOGETHER WITH ITS SKIN, ITS FLESH, AND ITS BLOOD</small>. These represent its commanders,<sup><xref rid="fn789">135</xref></sup> its governors,<sup><xref rid="fn790">136</xref></sup> and &#x007B;the&#x007D; [its] generals.<sup><xref rid="fn791">137</xref></sup> This is what is written (in Ezek. 27:27): <small>YOUR WEALTH, YOUR WARES, YOUR MERCHANDISE, YOUR MARINERS, YOUR SAILORS, YOUR LEAK REPAIRERS, THOSE WHO TRADE YOUR WARES, &#x003C;ALL YOUR MEN OF WAR WHO ARE IN YOUR MIDST, WITH ALL YOUR ASSEMBLY THAT IS IN YOUR MIDST&#x003E;, WILL SINK INTO THE HEART OF THE SEAS ON THE DAY OF YOUR DOWNFALL</small>. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: Even those who were outside your assembly, but who came and attached themselves to your assemblies, they also will sink into the heart of the seas on the day of your downfall.</p>
<title>6.28 Numbers 19:1ff, Part XXVIII</title>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 19:2): <small>&#x003C;A RED HEIFER WITHOUT BLEMISH, IN WHICH THERE IS NO DEFECT, ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO YOKE&#x003E;</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>HEIFER</small>. This is Israel, since it is written (in Hos. 4:16): <small>ISRAEL HAS BALKED LIKE A BALKY HEIFER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn792">138</xref></sup> (Numb. 19:2:) <small>RED</small>. This is Israel, of whom it is written (in Lam. 4:7): <small>THEIR LIMBS WERE REDDER THAN CORAL</small>. (Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>WITHOUT BLEMISH</small> (rt.:<italic><small>TMM</small></italic>). This is Israel, of whom it is written (in Cant. 6:9): <small>&#x003C;ONLY ONE IS&#x003E; MY DOVE, MY PERFECT ONE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TMM</small></italic>). (Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>IN WHICH THERE IS NO DEFECT</small>. This is Israel, of whom it is written (in Cant. 4:7): <small>AND THERE IS NO BLEMISH IN YOU</small>. (Numb. 19:2, cont.:) <small>ON WHICH THERE HAS BEEN NO YOKE</small>. This is the generation of Jeremiah, which did not take the yoke of the Holy One upon themselves. (Numb. 19:3:) <small>THEN YOU SHALL GIVE IT UNTO ELEAZAR THE PRIEST</small>. This is Jeremiah, of whom it is written (in Jer. 1:1): <small>ONE OF THE PRIESTS THAT WERE IN ANATHOTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn793">139</xref></sup> (Numb. 19:3, cont.:) <small>AND HE SHALL TAKE IT OUTSIDE THE CAMP</small>. (Ezra 5:12:) <small>AND HE DEPORTED THE PEOPLE TO BABYLON</small>. (Numb. 19:3, cont.:) <small>AND HE SHALL SLAUGHTER IT IN HIS PRESENCE</small>. (II Kings 25:7:) <small>THEY SLEW THE CHILDREN OF ZEDEKIAH BEFORE HIS EYES</small>. (Numb. 19:5:) <small>AND HE SHALL BURN THE HEIFER &#x003C;BEFORE HIS EYES&#x003E;</small>. (II Kings 25:9 &#x003D; Jer. 52:13:) <small>HE ALSO BURNED THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND THE HOUSE OF THE KING</small>. (Numb. 19:5, cont.:) <small>TOGETHER WITH ITS SKIN, &#x003C;ITS FLESH, AND ITS BLOOD&#x003E;</small>. (II Kings 25:9, cont. &#x003D; Jer. 52:13, cont:) <small>AND ALL THE HOUSES OF JERUSALEM, EVEN</small> &#x007B;<small>THE GREAT HOUSE</small>&#x007D; [<small>ALL THE GREAT ONE&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>] <small>DID HE BURN WITH FIRE</small>. Now why does &#x003C;Scripture&#x003E; call &#x003C;the heifer&#x003E; a <small>GREAT ONE&#x2019;S HOUSE</small>? It is simply that this was the house of study (<italic>bet midrash</italic>) that belonged to R. Johanan ben Zakkay, for there they taught the greatness of the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn794">140</xref></sup> (Numb. 19:6:) <small>&#x003C;AND THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE CEDAR WOOD, HYSSOP, AND CRIMSON STUFF, AND CAST THEM INTO THE MIDST OF THE BURNING HEIFER</small>.&#x003E; (Ibid.:) <small>AND &#x003C;HE&#x003E; SHALL TAKE</small>. This refers to Nebuchadnezzar. [(Ibid.:) <small>THE PRIEST</small>. This is Jeremiah, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 39:12, where Nebuchadnezzar gave the order): <small>TAKE HIM AND LOOK AFTER HIM</small>.] (Numb. 19:6, cont.:) <small>CEDAR WOOD, HYSSOP, AND CRIMSON STUFF</small>. These are Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND CAST THEM INTO THE MIDST OF THE BURNING HEIFER</small>. (Dan. 3:22): <small>THE FLAME OF THE FIRE SLEW THEM</small> (i.e., their executioners). (Numb. 19:9:) <small>THEN &#x003C;SOMEONE CLEAN&#x003E; SHALL GATHER &#x003C;THE ASHES OF THE HEIFER&#x003E;</small>. This refers to the Holy One, of whom it is stated (in Is. 11:12): <small>SO HE SHALL RAISE UP A SIGNAL FOR THE NATIONS AND GATHER THE OUTCASTS OF ISRAEL</small>. (Numb. 19:9:) <small>SOMEONE</small> (<italic>ish</italic>). This is the Holy One, of whom it is stated (in Exod. 15:3): <small>THE LORD IS A MAN</small> (<italic>ish</italic>) <small>OF WAR</small>. (Numb. 19:9, cont.:) <small>CLEAN</small> (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>). This is the Holy One, of whom it is stated (in Hab. 1:13): <small>YOUR EYES ARE TOO PURE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C;TO BEHOLD EVIL&#x003E;</small>. (Numb. 19:9, cont.:) <small>THE ASHES OF THE HEIFER</small>. These are the dispersed people of Israel. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DEPOSIT THEM OUTSIDE THE CAMP IN A CLEAN</small> (rt.: <italic>thr</italic>) <small>PLACE</small>. This &#x003C;place&#x003E; is Jerusalem, in that it is clean. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND IT SHALL BE KEPT FOR THE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>, because in this world things are &#x003C;pronounced&#x003E; unclean and clean from the mouth of a priest; however, in the world to come it shall not be so. Rather the Holy One is going to do the cleansing (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>), as stated (in Ezek. 36:25): <small>I WILL SPRINKLE PURE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>) <small>WATER UPON YOU, AND YOU SHALL BE PURE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>); <small>I WILL PURIFY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>THR</small></italic>) <small>YOU FROM ALL YOUR UNCLEANNESSES AND FROM ALL YOUR IDOLS</small>.</p>
<title>6.29 Numbers 20:7ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:7&#x2013;8:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES SAYING: TAKE THE ROD, AND ASSEMBLE THE CONGREGATION, &#x003C;YOU AND YOUR BROTHER AARON; AND SPEAK UNTO THE ROCK BEFORE THEIR EYES. THEN IT WILL GIVE ITS WATER, SO THAT YOU BRING WATER OUT OF THE ROCK FOR THEM</small>.&#x003E; [<small>THUS YOU SHALL PROVIDE THE CONGREGATION AND THEIR CATTLE WITH WATER</small>.] From here it is shown that the Holy One is concerned for Israel&#x2019;s wealth.<sup><xref rid="fn795">141</xref></sup> (Ibid., vs. 10:) <small>SO MOSES AND AARON GATHERED THE CONGREGATION BEFORE THE ROCK</small>. &#x003C;This verse&#x003E; teaches that each and every person sees himself as if he were standing at the rock. And similarly it says (in Lev. 8:3): <small>AND ASSEMBLE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. Here also all Israel was standing when they saw the miracles which happened at the rock. They began to say: Moses knows the natural properties of rock. If he wants, he will bring forth water out of this &#x003C;other&#x003E; one. Moses found himself confronted with a dilemma. If I listen to them, I am disregarding the words of the Omnipresent; and the Holy One (according to Job 5:13) <small>CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR OWN CUNNING</small>. After all, for the whole of these forty years Moses had been keeping himself from becoming angry with them, because he was afraid of the oath that the Holy One had sworn (in Deut. 1:35): <small>NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE FROM THIS EVIL GENERATION SHALL SEE &#x003C;THE GOOD LAND&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> They said to him: Here is a rock. Just as you wish to bring &#x003C;water&#x003E; from another rock, you should bring it from this one. He gave a command to them (in Numb. 20:10): <small>PLEASE LISTEN, YOU REBELS, &#x003C;SHALL WE BRING FORTH WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK</small>.&#x003E;</p>
<title>6.30 Numbers 20:7ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:11:) <small>THEN MOSES RAISED HIS HAND AND STRUCK THE ROCK TWICE WITH HIS ROD</small>. &#x003C;When&#x003E; he struck one time, the rock began dribbling a little water, as stated (in Ps. 78:20): <small>SEE, HE STRUCK A ROCK, AND WATER TRICKLED OUT</small>, like a person with a discharge, in that it dribbles &#x003C;in&#x003E; drops. They said to him: Son of Amram, is this water for nursing children or for babes weaned from milk? Immediately, he became angry with them, struck it (according to Numb. 20:11) <small>TWICE &#x003C;WITH HIS ROD&#x003E;, AND A LOT OF WATER CAME FORTH</small>. Yet for all that, Moses only made &#x003C;water&#x003E; from a rock, because the Holy One had told him.</p>
<title>6.31 Numbers 20:7ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:12:) [&#x003C;<small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON:&#x003E; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME</small>.] Did not Moses say something worse than this?<sup><xref rid="fn796">142</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 11:22): <small>ARE THERE &#x003C;ENOUGH&#x003E; FLOCKS AND HERDS TO SLAUGHTER FOR THEM</small>? <small>ARE THERE ENOUGH FISH IN THE SEA TO GATHER FOR THEM</small>?There also trust was lacking, and &#x003C;that lack of trust&#x003E; was greater than this one. So why did the Holy One not decree death for him there? &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a king who had a friend. Now when in private he displayed arrogance towards the king&#x2019;s son with harsh words, the king did not become angry with him. &#x003C;When, however,&#x003E; he arose one day and was arrogant in front of the legions,<sup><xref rid="fn797">143</xref></sup> he decreed death for him. So also did the Holy One say to Moses: When you acted privately with me, [I did not become angry], but now &#x003C;that you have acted&#x003E; in public, it is impossible &#x003C;to overlook your action&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 20:12):&#x003C;<small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON: BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST ME&#x003E; TO SHOW MY HOLINESS IN THE SIGHT OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003C;THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.32 Numbers 20:7ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:12:) <small>BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON:&#x003E; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME&#x2026;</small>. If Moses sinned, how did Aaron sin?<sup><xref rid="fn798">144</xref></sup> The matter is comparable to creditor who came to take away a debtor&#x2019;s barn. He took away both his &#x003C;barn&#x003E; and that of his friend. The debtor said: If I am guilty, how has my neighbor sinned? Similarly Moses said: Sovereign of the World, I did become angry, &#x003C;but&#x003E; how has Aaron sinned? Therefore the Holy One praises<sup><xref rid="fn799">145</xref></sup> him, where it is stated (in Deut. 33:8): <small>AND OF LEVI HE SAID:</small> [<small>LET</small>] <small>YOUR THUMMIM AND URIM</small> [<small>BE WITH YOUR FAITHFUL ONE, WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH &#x003C;AND&#x003E; WITH WHOM YOU CONTENDED AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH</small>]. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World,<sup><xref rid="fn800">146</xref></sup> see, you have decreed for me to die in the desert along with this wicked generation, as stated (in Ps. 78:40): <small>HOW OFTEN DID THEY DEFY HIM IN THE DESERT AND GRIEVE HIM IN THE WILDERNESS</small>. Now the &#x003C;future&#x003E; generations will say I was like them. Let it be written about me why I came to be punished. It is therefore written (in Numb. 20:12:) <small>&#x003C;BUT THE LORD SAID TO MOSES AND AARON: &#x003E; BECAUSE YOU DID NOT TRUST IN ME</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: With what countenance do you want to enter the land?<sup><xref rid="fn801">147</xref></sup> The situation is comparable to a shepherd who went out to feed the king&#x2019;s flock, and the flock was carried off. &#x003C; When&#x003E; the shepherd wanted to come into the king&#x2019;s palace,<sup><xref rid="fn802">148</xref></sup> &#x003C;the king said to him: They will say that you caused the flock to be carried off&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn803">149</xref></sup> Here also the Holy One said to Moses: Your glory is that you are the one who led sixty myriads out &#x003C;of bondage&#x003E;. However, you buried them in the desert and are bringing another generation into &#x003C;the land&#x003E;. Now they will say: the generation of the wilderness has no share in the world to come. Rather sleep with them, and come along with them. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:21): [<small>FOR THERE IS AN HONORED LAWGIVER&#x2019;S PORTION</small>,] <small>WHERE HE CAME AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE. HE CARRIED OUT THE LORD&#x2019;S RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS ORDINANCES FOR ISRAEL</small>.</p>
<title>6.33 Numbers 20:14ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:14:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT MESSENGERS FROM KADESH UNTO THE KING OF EDOM: THUS SAYS YOUR BROTHER ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 15:3): <small>NOR TAKES UP A REPROACH AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR</small>. By universal custom, when a person is engaged in business<sup><xref rid="fn804">150</xref></sup> with his friend who causes a loss, he separates himself from him and does not want to see him.<sup><xref rid="fn805">151</xref></sup> But although Moses was punished because of Israel, as stated (in Ps. 106:32): <small>AND IT WENT ILL WITH MOSES ON THEIR ACCOUNT</small>, he did unload their burden from himself. Instead (according to Numb. 20:14), <small>THEN MOSES SENT MESSENGERS</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 20:14, cont.:) <small>YOU KNOW ALL THE TROUBLE THAT HAS BEFALLEN US</small>. He said to him: You know when the Holy One said to Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): <small>KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN &#x003C;IN A LAND NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM&#x003E;</small>. We have been enslaved, while you are born free.</p>
<title>6.34 Numbers 20:14ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:15:) <small>HOW OUR ANCESTORS WENT DOWN TO EGYPT</small>. This whole subject is comparable to two brothers against whose grandfather a promissory note appeared. One of them arose and paid it. One day he started to ask a favor from his brother. He said to him: You know that debt was incumbent on both of us, but it was I who paid it. Do not refuse any of my favor that I am asking.</p>
<title>6.35 Numbers 20:14ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:17:) <small>PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND. &#x003C;WE WILL NOT PASS THROUGH FIELD OR VINEYARD, &#x003E; NOR SHALL WE DRINK WATER FROM A WELL</small>. Should it have said: &#x201C;Water from cisterns?&#x201D; &#x003C;By this use of the singular, <small>A WELL&#x003E;</small>, Torah has taught you proper conduct, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; that when one who goes to a land which is not one&#x2019;s own, [though he has at hand his necessities,] he should not drink from what he has on hand. Rather he should put aside what he has, and buy from the shopkeeper in order to benefit him. So also Moses said to &#x003C;the king of Edom&#x003E;: &#x003C;We have&#x003E; a well with us,<sup><xref rid="fn806">152</xref></sup> and we eat our own manna; &#x003C;but&#x003E; do not say that we are a bother to you. You will make a profit for yourselves. So also did Moses say (to king Sihon of Heshbon in Deut. 2:28): <small>YOU SHALL SELL ME FOOD FOR MONEY</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 20:17, cont.:) <small>WE SHALL GO ALONG THE KING&#x2019;S HIGHWAY</small>, since we restrain<sup><xref rid="fn807">153</xref></sup> our cattle.</p>
<p>(Numb. 20:17, cont.:) <small>WITHOUT TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT</small>. This was the most difficult &#x003C;stipulation&#x003E; of them all, for they said: In all &#x003C;the lands&#x003E; around us we have permission to kill and plunder, but within your border <small>&#x003C;WE SHALL WALK THE KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>HIGHWAY&#x003E; WITHOUT TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT &#x003C;UNTIL WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH YOUR TERRITORY.&#x003E;</small></p>
<title>6.36 Numbers 20:14ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:18:) <small>BUT EDOM SAID UNTO HIM: YOU SHALL NOT PASS THROUGH ME</small>. This text is related to Ps. 120:7): <small>I AM FOR PEACE; BUT WHEN I SPEAK, THEY ARE FOR WAR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn808">154</xref></sup> Where is it shown that the Holy One also told them that they would not permit you to pass, &#x003C;that&#x003E; everything is not due to them, but &#x003C;that&#x003E; it is I who wills it? Where it is stated (in Deut. 2:5): <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE, FOR I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ENOUGH OF THEIR LAND FOR &#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; THE SOLE OF A FOOT TO TREAD ON</small>.</p>
<title>6.37 Numbers 20:22ff, Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:22:) <small>THEN SETTING OUT FROM KADESH, &#x003C;THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF&#x003E; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME &#x003C;TO MOUNT HOR&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to II Chron. 20:37): <small>BECAUSE YOU HAVE JOINED</small> &#x007B;<small>TO THE WICKED ONE</small>&#x007D; [<small>WITH AHAZIAH</small>],<sup><xref rid="fn809">155</xref></sup> <small>THE LORD WILL DESTROY YOUR WORK</small>. &#x003C;Similarly,&#x003E; because they made an alliance with this wicked king to pass through his land, they lost this righteous man (i.e., Aaron).<sup><xref rid="fn810">156</xref></sup> For that reason the death of Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn811">157</xref></sup> is added &#x003C; immediately&#x003E; after the parashah on the king of Edom. (Numb. 20:21&#x2013;22:) <small>SO ISRAEL TURNED AWAY FROM THEM. THEN SETTING OUT FROM KADESH, &#x003C;THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME &#x003C;TO MOUNT HOR&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn812">158</xref></sup></p>
<p>[(Numb. 20:22:) <small>THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME TO MOUNT HOR</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>THE WHOLE CONGREGATION</small>? A complete congregation, a congregation which would be entering the land, since those who had come out from Egypt had died. So these were the ones of whom it is written (in Deut. 4:4): <small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>.</p>
<p>[(Numb. 20:22:) <small>MOUNT</small> (<italic><small>HR</small></italic>) <small>HOR</small> (<italic><small>HR</small></italic>).] What is the meaning of <small>MOUNT HOR</small>? A mountain (<italic><small>HR</small></italic>) on top of a mountain (<italic><small>HR</small></italic>) like a small apple on a large apple. Even though a cloud proceeded before them which lowered the high &#x003C;places&#x003E; and raised up the low, the Holy One left &#x003C;this&#x003E; mountain as a sample,<sup><xref rid="fn813">159</xref></sup> so that they would know what miracles the Holy One had done for them. Now he had not left a mountain in the desert, lest they become weary because of them. Moreover, although the cloud had made all the desert a plain, he left an elevated spot where the tabernacle would have its resting place. He also left three mountains: Mount Sinai for the Divine Presence, Mount Nebo for the burial of Moses, and Mount Hor for the burial of Aaron.</p>
<title>6.38 Numbers 20:22ff, Part X</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:23&#x2013;24:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON ON MOUNT HOR</small>, [&#x2026;:] <small>AARON WILL BE GATHERED</small><sup><xref rid="fn814">160</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;UNTO HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This passage&#x003E; teaches that the righteous are informed of the day of their death, so that they may bequeath their crown to their children.<sup><xref rid="fn815">161</xref></sup> So why did Aaron not die as Miriam died, since no one mortal knew about her &#x003C;death&#x003E;? It was, however, told to Moses: <small>AARON WILL BE GATHERED &#x003C;UNTO HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>? &#x003C;The situation&#x003E; is comparable to a king who had two ministers of finance,<sup><xref rid="fn816">162</xref></sup> who did not act without the king&#x2019;s knowledge. One of them had a beautiful undergarment belonging to the king, which the king needed for himself. The king said: Although I have a need for that which is my property, I am not taking it away until I inform him. So also did the Holy One say: These two righteous men have done nothing without my knowledge. Now that I am taking them away, I shall not take them away until I inform them. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:24): <small>&#x003C;THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO AARON ON MOUNT HOR, &#x2026;:&#x003E; AARON WILL BE GATHERED &#x003C;UNTO HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>6.39 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XI</title>
<p>&#x007B;(Deut. 32:51:) <small>BECAUSE YOU ACTED FAITHLESSLY WITH ME</small>&#x007D; [(Numb. 20:24, cont.:) <small>BECAUSE YOU REBELLED AGAINST MY COMMAND AT THE WATERS OF MERIBAH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 10:3): <small>LORD WILL NOT LET A RIGHTEOUS SOUL GO HUNGRY</small>. This refers to the first Adam,<sup><xref rid="fn817">163</xref></sup> in that none of the righteous, who stem from him and upon whom has been decreed sentence of death, will pass away until they see the face of the Divine Presence. Then they will reprove the first Adam and say to him: You have caused us death; but he will answer them: I have &#x003C;only&#x003E; one sin on my hands; but in your case, is there a single one of you that does not have a lot of offenses on his hands? So where is it shown that the righteous see the face of the Divine Presence? Where it is stated (in Is. 38:11): <small>I SAID: I SHALL NOT SEE THE LORD, EVEN THE LORD IN THE LAND OF THE LIVING</small>. The righteous shall be punished with death on account of small transgressions, so that the first Adam will not be blamed on their account. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 10:3): <small>LORD WILL NOT LET A RIGHTEOUS SOUL GO HUNGRY</small>. it is therefore stated (in Numb. 20:24): <small>BECAUSE YOU REBELLED</small>.</p>
<title>6.40 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XII</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:25&#x2013;26:) <small>TAKE AARON &#x003C;AND HIS SON ELEAZAR&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>AND STRIP AARON</small>. The Holy One said to Moses: See, you may console him that you are bequeathing his crown to his son.<sup><xref rid="fn818">164</xref></sup> &#x003C;This is&#x003E; something that you are not bequeathing to your own children.</p>
<p>(Numb. 20:28:) <small>SO MOSES STRIPPED AARON OF HIS VESTMENTS AN PUT THEM ON HIS SON ELEAZAR</small>. But if the High Priest leaves the Temple mount in priestly vestments, does he not receive forty lashes,<sup><xref rid="fn819">165</xref></sup> since &#x003C;these vestments&#x003E; are &#x003C;made of&#x003E; wool and flax?<sup><xref rid="fn820">166</xref></sup> However, &#x003C;Scripture serves&#x003E; to inform you that, with the wording by which he inducted him into the priesthood, when &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; said to &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; (in Lev. 8:2): <small>TAKE AARON</small>, with this very wording he also said to him (in Numb. 20:25): <small>TAKE AARON</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 20:27:) <small>SO</small> [<small>MOSES</small>] <small>DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED</small>. &#x003C;This verse serves&#x003E; to teach you that, even though he had spoken to him a harsh commandment against his brother, he did not hesitate.<sup><xref rid="fn821">167</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.41 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 20:29:) <small>THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD DIED</small>. When Moses and Eleazar came down [from the mountain], the whole congregation assembled themselves against them and said: Where is Aaron?<sup><xref rid="fn822">168</xref></sup> They said to them: He is dead. They said to them: How could the angel of death hurt him, a man who has halted the angel of death and held him back? It is so stated (in Numb. 17:13 [16:48]): <small>SO HE</small> (i.e., Aaron) <small>STOOD BETWEEN THE DEAD AND THE LIVING, AND THE PLAGUE WAS HALTED</small>. They said to them: If you bring him &#x003C;back&#x003E;, well and good, but if not, we will stone you to death. At that time Moses said: Sovereign of the World: deliver us from &#x003C;this&#x003E; distrust. Immediately the Holy One opened the &#x003C;burial&#x003E; cave and brought him to them for them to see him. It is so stated (in Numb. 20:29): <small>THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD DIED&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>6.42 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XIV</title>
<p>[(Numb. 20:29:) <small>THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD DIED</small>.] What is written after this (in Numb. 21:1)? <small>WHEN THE CANAANITE KING OF ARAD, WHO DWELT IN THE NEGEB, HEARD &#x003C;THAT ISRAEL HAD COME&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn823">169</xref></sup> This &#x003C;king&#x003E; was Amalek, since it is stated (in Numb. 13:29): <small>AMALEK DWELLS IN THE LAND OF THE NEGEB</small>. Now he dwelt in the gap (in the border), and when he heard that Aaron was dead and that the clouds of glory had departed, he immediately engaged them in battle.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:1, cont.:) <small>BY WAY OF ATHARIM</small> (a place name interpreted as coming from <italic><small>TWR</small></italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn824">170</xref></sup> for the great scout (rt.: <italic><small>TWR</small></italic>) had died, the one that had scouted (rt.: <italic><small>TWR</small></italic>) the way for them. It is so stated (in Numb. 10:33): <small>AND THE ARK</small> (<italic>Aron</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn825">171</xref></sup> <small>OF THE COVENANT OF THE LORD TRAVELED AHEAD OF THEM THREE DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY TO SEEK</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TWR</small></italic>) <small>OUT A RESTING PLACE FOR THEM</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:1, cont.:) <small>HE FOUGHT AGAINST ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;That king&#x003E; was Amalek. Why did &#x003C; Scripture &#x003E; call him a Canaanite? Because because Israel was forbidden to fight with the children of Esau, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 2:5): <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE</small>. When Amalek came and engaged in battle with them a first time and a second, the Holy One said to them: This &#x003C;nation&#x003E; is not forbidden like the the children of Esau. Just look. They are like Canaanites, of whom it is stated (in Deut. 20:17): <small>NO, YOU SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM: THE HITTITES, THE AMORITES, THE CANAANITES</small>, [&#x2026;.] For that reason he was called a Canaanite; and from time immemorial Amalek has been a &#x007B;scourge&#x007D; [strap] for the punishment of Israel. You find that, when Aaron died, Amalek went out against them; and Israel retreated back seven stages &#x003C;of their journey&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 10:6): <small>THEN FROM THE WELLS OF BENE-JAAKAN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED TO MOSERAH. THERE AARON DIED&#x2026;</small>. Did Aaron die there? Did he not die on Mount Hor, as stated (in Numb. 20:28) <small>AND AARON DIED THERE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAIN</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn826">172</xref></sup> The verses are evidence of seven stages backwards (from Mount Hor to Moserah)<sup><xref rid="fn827">173</xref></sup> to teach you that &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; had retreated.</p>
<title>6.43 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XV</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:4:) <small>THEN THEY JOURNEYED FROM MOUNT HOR BY WAY OF THE REED SEA IN ORDER TO GO AROUND THE LAND OF EDOM, BUT THE PEOPLE&#x2019;S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>. But is it not written (of that era in Neh. 9:20): <small>AND YOU GAVE YOUR GOOD SPIRIT TO ENLIGHTEN THEM</small>? It is simply that those remnants of Israel which had came out of Egypt, over whom death had been decreed, saw neither a peaceful nor agreeable spirit in the desert.<sup><xref rid="fn828">174</xref></sup> Thus it says (in Numb. 14:33&#x2013;34): <small>AND YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE SHEPHERDS IN THE WILDERNESS</small>, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; [&#x003C;&#x2026;,&#x003E; <small>AND YOU SHALL KNOW MY DISPLEASURE</small>.] This was because (according to Numb. 21:4) <small>THE PEOPLE&#x2019;S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>.</p>
<title>6.44 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XVI</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:5:) <small>AND THE PEOPLE SPOKE AGAINST GOD AND AGAINST MOSES</small>. They made a slave comparable to his buyer.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:5:) <small>OUR SOUL LOATHES THIS MISERABLE FOOD</small>, for that generation was unable to taste any of the fruits of the land. R. Aqiva said: When merchants disclosed to them [a basket] with some fruits of the land, they died. It is so stated (in Numb. 32:11): <small>SURELY NONE OF THE PEOPLE &#x003C;WHO CAME UP FROM EGYPT, FROM TWENTY YEARS AND UP,&#x003E; SHALL SEE &#x003C;THE LAND WHICH I PROMISED ON OATH TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB</small>, i.e.,&#x003E; any good that comes because of the land. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:6): <small>BUT THE PEOPLE&#x2019;S TEMPER GREW SHORT ON THE WAY</small>.</p>
<title>6.45 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XVII</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SENT FIERY SERPENTS AMONG THE PEOPLE</small>. Why did the Holy One see fit to exact retribution from them through serpents?<sup><xref rid="fn829">175</xref></sup> It is simply that the snake started &#x003C;the use of&#x003E; slanderous language at the beginning and was cursed, but they did not learn from it. The Holy One said: Let the serpent, which was the first &#x003C;to use&#x003E; slanderous language, come and exact retribution from the those who &#x003C;still&#x003E; speak slanderous language. This is what is written (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO BREAKS THROUGH A BARRIER</small><sup><xref rid="fn830">176</xref></sup> <small>WILL HAVE A SNAKE BITE HIM</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of why retribution was exacted from them through serpents. Even though the serpent eats all the luxury foods of the world, for him they are turned to dust in his mouth and belly. Thus it is stated (in Is. 65:25): <small>BUT THE SERPENT&#x2019;S FOOD SHALL BE DUST</small>. Now these people ate the manna, as stated (in Ps. 106:15): <small>SO HE GAVE THEM WHAT THEY ASKED FOR</small>. It also says (in Deut. 2:7): <small>THESE FORTY YEARS THE LORD YOUR GOD HAS BEEN WITH YOU; YOU HAVE LACKED NOTHING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn831">177</xref></sup> Let a serpent that eats many species and has &#x003C;but&#x003E; one taste in his mouth come and exact the retribution &#x007B;from one species and those who eat it&#x007D; [from those who eat one species] and taste many species.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:6:) <small>FIERY</small> (<italic>serafim</italic>). &#x003C;They are called seraphim&#x003E; because they burn (<italic>sorefim</italic>) the soul.</p>
<title>6.46 Numbers 20:22ff, Part XVIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:7:) <small>THEN THE PEOPLE CAME UNTO MOSES AND SAID: WE HAVE SINNED</small>. They knew that they had spoken against Moses, so they fell prostrate before him and said (ibid., cont.): <small>PRAY UNTO THE LORD TO REMOVE THE SERPENT</small><sup><xref rid="fn832">178</xref></sup> <small>FROM US</small>. &#x003C;The passage serves&#x003E; to make Moses&#x2019; humility known to you, in that he did not hesitate to seek mercy for them and to make the power of repentance known to you. As soon as they said: We have sinned, he was immediately reconciled to them. &#x003C;The passage serves&#x003E; to teach you that there is no one who forgives that becomes cruel. And where is it shown that, if one has sinned against his companion and says to him: I have sinned, without &#x003C;the companion&#x003E; forgiving him, that &#x003C;the unforgiving one&#x003E; is called a sinner? Where it is stated (in I Sam. 12:23): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>AS FOR ME ALSO, FAR BE IT FOR ME TO SIN AGAINST THE LORD BY CEASING TO PRAY ON YOUR BEHALF</small>. When? When they came and said to him: We have sinned, [as stated] (in I Sam. 12:10): <small>AND</small> [<small>THEY</small>] &#x007B;<small>THE PEOPLE</small>] <small>SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO SAMUEL</small>&#x007D;: <small>WE HAVE SINNED&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:8): <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: MAKE A SERAPH, &#x003C;AND PUT IT ON A POLE&#x003E;. THEN IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, WHEN ANYONE BITTEN &#x003C;LOOKS AT IT, HE SHALL LIVE&#x003E;</small>, not only one bitten by a serpent, but <small>ANYONE BITTEN</small>, even one bitten by an adder, by a scorpion, a wild beast, or a dog.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:9:) <small>SO MOSES MADE A BRONZE SERPENT &#x003C;AND SET IT UP BY A MIRACLE&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn833">179</xref></sup> He tossed it into the air and it remained there.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:10:) <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED ON AND CAMPED IN OBOTH</small> (<italic>ovot,</italic> rt: &#x2019;<italic><small>WB</small></italic>), because they had become enemies (<italic>oyevim,</italic> rt: &#x2019;<italic><small>YB</small></italic>) to the Omnipresent.<sup><xref rid="fn834">180</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 21:11:) <small>AND THEY CAMPED AT IYE-ABARIM</small> (&#x2018;<italic>avarim,</italic> rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>), because they were full of transgressions (&#x2018;<italic>averot,</italic> rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>).</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:12:) <small>AND THEY CAMPED IN THE WADI ZERED</small>, because the wadi was &#x003C;only&#x003E; about a full span (<italic>zeret</italic>) &#x003C;in width&#x003E;; but they were unable to cross it for thirty-eight years. [Thus it is stated] (in Deut. 2:13&#x2013;14): <small>NOW THEN ARISE AND CROSS THE WADI ZERED&#x2026;. AND THE TIME THAT WE TRAVELED FROM KADESH-BARNEA UNTIL WE CROSSED THE WADI ZERED WAS THIRTY-EIGHT YEARS</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:13:) <small>FROM THERE THEY JOURNEYED AND CAMPED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF</small> (<italic><small>M</small>&#x2019;<small>BR</small></italic>) <small>THE ARNON</small> (rt.: <italic><small>RNN</small></italic>) &#x2026;, because the Omnipresent was reconciled to them.<sup><xref rid="fn835">181</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.47 Numbers 21:16ff, Part XIX</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:17:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SANG THIS SONG</small>. This song (of the well) was uttered at the end of forty &#x003C;years&#x003E;, while the well was given to them at the beginning of the forty &#x003C;years&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn836">182</xref></sup> So what was the purpose of writing &#x003C;it down&#x003E; here?. This matter has been explained from what is above (in vs. 14): <small>IT IS THEREFORE SAID IN THE BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD</small>: &#x2019;<italic><small>T</small></italic><sup><xref rid="fn837">183</xref></sup> <small>WAHEB IN SUPHAH</small> (<italic>Sufah</italic>) <small>&#x003C;AND</small> &#x2019;<small><italic>T</italic> THE WADIES OF THE ARNON</small>,&#x003E; &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; the signs (&#x2019;<italic><small>TWT</small></italic>, singular: &#x2019;<italic><small>T</small></italic>) and miracles [which were done for them] in the Arnon Wadies were like the miracles which were done for them in the Reed (<italic>Suf</italic>) Sea. What were the Miracles in the Arnon Wadies? One would stand on one mountain and speak with his companion on the other mountain; yet he was seven miles<sup><xref rid="fn838">184</xref></sup> away from him. Now the road decended into the middle of the wadi and then ascended, and Israel&#x2019;s course was to cross through the midst of the wadies. All the nations assembled endless troops.<sup><xref rid="fn839">185</xref></sup> Some of them took up positions in the middle of the wadi. Moreover, &#x003C;the slope of&#x003E; the wadi<sup><xref rid="fn840">186</xref></sup> above them became riddled with caves, and facing them was a mountain which correspondingly became riddled with crags in the form of breasts (<italic><small>S</small>h<small>DYM</small></italic>), as stated (in Numb. 21:15): <small>AND THE SLOPE</small> (&#x2019;<italic><small>S</small>h<small>D</small></italic>) <small>OF THE WADIES</small>. The troops entered into the caves; for they said: As soon as Israel comes down into the wadi, those ahead of them who are in the wadi and those above from out of the caves will arise and kill all of them. When Israel did arrive at that place, the Holy One did not make it necessary for them to go down into the wadi. Instead, he gave a signal to the mountains, and the &#x003C;craggy&#x003E; breasts of the latter mountain entered the caves, so that they all died. Moreover, the mountains brought their summits so close to each other, that they became a highway, for there was no knowing &#x003C;where&#x003E; each one joined its neighbor. Furthermore, that wadi separates the borders between the land of Israel and the land of Moab, as stated (in Numb. 21:13 &#x003D; Jud. 11:18): <small>FOR THE ARNON IS THE BORDER OF MOAB</small>. The mountain in the land of Moab, the one with the caves, was [not] shaken; but the mountain in the land of Israel, the one with the crags in the form of breasts, was shaken and joined to the mountain opposite. Why was it shaken? Because it belonged to the land of Israel. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a female slave who saw her master&#x2019;s son coming to her.<sup><xref rid="fn841">187</xref></sup> She jumped up to greet him and welcome him. The crags entered into the caves and all those warriors were crushed. Then the well descended to the wadi, where it became became a mighty &#x003C;torrent&#x003E; and destroyed the troops, just as the &#x003C;Reed&#x003E; Sea had destroyed those &#x003C;Egyptians&#x003E;. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:14): <small>WAHEB IN SUPHAH</small> (<italic>Sufah</italic>) <small>AND THE WADIES OF THE ARNON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn842">188</xref></sup> When Israel crossed upon those mountains without knowing about all these miracles the Holy One said: Behold, I will let the children of Israel know how many troops I destroyed because of them. The well descended into the cave and brought out innumerable skulls, arms, and legs. Thus when Israel returned to seek the well, they saw it shining like the moon in the midst of the wadi, as it discharged the limbs of the troops. And where is it shown that the well informed &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; about them? Where it is stated (in Numb. 21:15&#x2013;16): <small>AND THE SLOPE OF THE WADIES&#x2026;. &#x003C;AND FROM THERE THEY CONTINUED TO BEER, I.E., THE WELL</small> (<italic>beer</italic>.) <small>WHERE THE LORD SAID TO MOSES&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small></p>
<p>(Numb. 21:16:) <small>AND FROM THERE &#x003C;THEY CONTINUED&#x003E; TO BEER</small>. But was not &#x003C;the well&#x003E; with them from the beginning of the forty years? It is simply that it had gone down to proclaim the miracles, while Israel remained at the wadies and said to it (in Numb. 21:17, cont:) <small>RISE UP, O WELL, SING TO IT</small>.</p>
<title>6.48 Numbers 21:16ff, Part XX</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:17:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SANG</small>. For what reason is Moses not mentioned there?<sup><xref rid="fn843">189</xref></sup> For the reason that he was being punished because of the waters, and no person praises<sup><xref rid="fn844">190</xref></sup> his executioner.<sup><xref rid="fn845">191</xref></sup> And why is the name of the Holy One not mentioned there? &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a governor who made a banquet for the king. The King said: Will my friend so-and-so be there? They told him: No. He said: I also am not going there. [Also here the Holy One said: In as much as Moses is not mentioned, I also will not be mentioned there.]</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:18:) <small>THE WELL THAT THE PRINCES DUG</small>. Was it dug there? It is simply that it was given through the merit of the ancestors, since they were called princes. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 105:41&#x2013;12): <small>HE OPENED A ROCK, AND WATER GUSHED OUT&#x2026;</small>. [<small>FOR</small>] <small>HE REMEMBERED HIS HOLY PROMISE AND HIS SERVANT ABRAHAM</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:18, cont.:) <small>THAT THE NOBLES OF THE PEOPLE DUG &#x003C;WITH THE SCEPTER, EVEN WITH THEIR OWN STAFFS&#x003E;</small>. When the princes were standing by it, with each and every one drawing &#x003C;the water&#x003E; with his own staff for his own tribe and for his own family, the space between the standards was filled with a &#x003C;flow of&#x003E; water that was gathering strength. A woman who had to go to her companion went from standard to standard by ship, as stated (in Ps. 105:41): <small>THEY TRAVELED THE RIVER BY <italic>TSIYYOT</italic></small>.<sup><xref rid="fn846">192</xref></sup> Now a <italic>tsiyyot</italic> (here understood as the plural of <italic>tsi</italic>) can only denote a ship, since it is stated (in Is. 33:21): <small>NOR SHALL A STATELY SHIP</small> (<italic>tsi</italic>) <small>PASS BY</small>. Now the waters flowed outside the camp and embraced a great strip of land. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 23:3) <small>HE LEADS ME IN PATHS</small> (literally: <small>CIRCLES</small>) <small>OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. In addition, &#x003C;the encircling waters&#x003E; cause endless varieties of green herbage and trees to grow, as stated (in Ps. 23:2): <small>HE MAKES ME LIE DOWN IN GREEN PASTURES; HE LEADS ME BESIDE STILL WATERS</small>. All the days they were in the desert they used it (i.e., the well).<sup><xref rid="fn847">193</xref></sup> Therefore, they rendered praise for it &#x003C;with the song ending&#x003E;: (in Numb. 21:18): <small>THE WELL THAT THE PRINCES DUG</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:18, cont.:) <small>FROM THE DESERT OF MATTANAH</small>, &#x003C;so stated&#x003E; because in the desert &#x003C;the well&#x003E; was given (<italic>nittenah</italic>) them to use &#x003C;as a gift (<italic>mattanah</italic>)&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn848">194</xref></sup></p>
<title>6.49 Numbers 21:16ff, Part XXI</title>
<p>Another interpretation: Why was &#x003C;the well&#x003E; given in the desert? Because if it had been given to them in the land, the tribe in whose border it was given would have argued and said: I have a prior claim to it. For that reason it was given in the desert where all would have an equal claim to it. And for what other reason was it given in the desert? Just as a desert is neither sown nor cultivated, so is the one who receives the words of Torah. They remove from him the yoke of the government and the yoke of earning a living. Just as a desert does not grow <italic>annona</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn849">195</xref></sup> so are children of Torah (i.e., Torah scholars) children of freedom.<sup><xref rid="fn850">196</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation &#x003C;of why it was given&#x003E; in the desert. Whoever fulfills the Torah is one who uses himself like the desert, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; whoever uses himself like a desert and removes himself from everything &#x003C;that might distract him&#x003E;.</p>
<title>6.50 Numbers 21:16ff, Part XXII</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:19:) <small>FROM MATTANAH TO NAHALIEL, AND FROM NAHALIEL TO BAMOTH</small>. These refer to the Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn851">197</xref></sup> in the enclosure (i.e., the Temple court) beside the altar. (Numb. 21:20:) F<small>ROM BAMOTH TO THE VALLEY THAT IS IN THE PLAIN OF MOAB</small>. These refer to the Sanhedrin, when it was in the chamber of Hewn Stones, which was in region of that woman who came from the plain of Moab (i.e., Ruth), of whom it is stated (in Ruth 2:6): <small>SHE IS THE YOUNG MOABITE WOMAN WHO CAME BACK WITH NAOMI FROM THE PLAINS OF MOAB</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:20, cont.:) <small>&#x003C;AT THE SUMMIT OF PISGAH,&#x003E; WHICH IS VISIBLE ON THE SURFACE OF WILDERNESS</small> (<italic>yeshimon</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn852">198</xref></sup> for from there Torah goes forth into the world.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of ibid.:) <small>WHICH IS VISIBLE</small>. This is in reference to the well which accompanied them until it entered the sea of Tiberias.<sup><xref rid="fn853">199</xref></sup> Then one standing <small>ON THE SURFACE OF THE WILDERNESS</small> sees something in the midst of the sea about the size of the mouth of an oven; and that is the well, which is <small>VISIBLE ON THE SURFACE OF THE WILDERNESS</small>.</p>
<title>6.51 Numbers 21:21ff, Part XXIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:21:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS TO SIHON</small>. This text is related (to Pss. 34:15 [14]): <small>DEPART FROM EVIL AND DO GOOD; SEEK PEACE AND PURSUE IT</small>. The Torah did not command &#x003C;them&#x003E; to go in pursuit of the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn854">200</xref></sup> Rather &#x003C;it says&#x003E;: (as in Deut. 22:6:) <small>WHEN YOU COME ON A BIRD&#x2019;S NEST</small>, (as in Exod. 23:4:) <small>WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER THE OX OF ONE WHO HATES YOU</small>, (as in Exod 23:5:) <small>WHEN YOU SEE THE DONKEY OF ONE WHO HATES YOU</small>, (as in Deut. 24:20:) <small>WHEN YOU BEAT YOUR OLIVE TREE</small>, (as in Deut. 24:21:) <small>WHEN YOU GATHER THE GRAPES OF YOUR VINEYARD</small>, (as in Deut. 23:25:) <small>WHEN YOU GO INTO YOUR NEIGHBOR</small>&#x2019;s <small>VINEYARD</small>. If &#x003C;these situations&#x003E; present themselves to you, you are given a command concerning them; but &#x003C;you are&#x003E; not to go in pursuit of them. In the case of peace, however, (according to Ps. 34:15 [14]): <small>SEEK PEACE</small>, wherever you are, <small>AND PURSUE IT</small>, wherever else it may be. And this is what Israel did. Although the Holy One had said to them (in Deut. 2:24): <small>BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION, AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>, they went in pursuit of peace.</p>
<title>6.52 Numbers 21:21ff, Part XXIV</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:21:) <small>THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS &#x003C;UNTO SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES&#x003E;</small>. All the words of Torah are necessary to each other, for what one covers over the other opens up.<sup><xref rid="fn855">201</xref></sup> It is stated here (in Numb. 21:21): <small>THEN ISRAEL SENT MESSENGERS</small>, while in another place &#x003C;Scripture&#x003E; ascribes the sending to Moses. [Thus it is stated] (in Deut. 2:26): <small>THEN I SENT MESSENGERS FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH &#x003C;UNTO KING SIHON OF HESHBON WITH WORDS OF PEACE&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Both verses are necessary&#x003E; to teach you that the head of a generation is surely equivalent to the whole generation. (Numb. 20:17:) <small>PLEASE LET US PASS THROUGH YOUR LAND</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn856">202</xref></sup> As he had sent to inform the king of Edom &#x003C;that he would do no damage, so did he send to this one&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn857">203</xref></sup> (in Deut. 2:28): <small>YOU SHALL SELL ME FOOD FOR MONEY&#x2026;</small>. It is customary for water to be given gratis, but I am giving payment for it. (Numb. 21:22:) <small>WE WILL GO BY THE KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>HIGHWAY</small> [<small>UNTIL WE HAVE PASSED THROUGH YOUR TERRITORY</small>]. In another place it is written (in Deut. 2:29): <small>UNTIL HAVE CROSSED THE JORDAN</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to one guarding a vine or fig tree. When someone comes and says: Let me pass through here, so that I may gather grapes from the vineyard, he says to him: It is only because of you that I am sitting on guard. So would you come to gather the grapes? So it was with Sihon. He received wages from all the kings of Canaan; and they would bring taxes up to him, for he had made them kings. Moreover he and Og were considered the equivalent of them all, since it is stated (in Ps. 136:19&#x2013;20): <small>SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES &#x2026;; AND OG, KING OF BASHAN</small>. Israel said to &#x003C;Sihon&#x003E;: Let us pass through your land<sup><xref rid="fn858">204</xref></sup> to conquer the kings. He said to them: I am sitting here to guard them from you. (Numb. 21:23:) <small>SO SIHON DID NOT ALLOW ISRAEL TO CROSS ON HIS TERRITORY. INSTEAD SIHON GATHERED ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WENT OUT AGAINST ISRAEL</small>. The Holy One acted with forethought to deliver him into their hand without trouble. It is written (in Numb. 21:34 &#x003D; Deut. 3:2): <small>TO KING SIHON OF THE AMORITES WHO DWELT IN HESHBON</small> (i.e., <small>WITH CALCULATION</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn859">205</xref></sup> If Heshbon had been full of mosquitos, no mortal could have prevailed against it; and it goes without saying that he was a warrior and dwelt in a fortified city. If he and his troops<sup><xref rid="fn860">206</xref></sup> had dwelt &#x003C; scattered about&#x003E; in his towns, Israel would have worn themselves out to prevail against him and conquer each and every town. Instead the Holy One gathered them together so as to deliver them into their hand without [trouble. And so it said (in Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON &#x003C;AND HIS LAND&#x003E; OVER TO YOU</small>. They killed all his warriors who had come out against them. Then they returned for the women and infants without] exertion. It is therefore written (in Numb. 21:23): <small>INSTEAD SIHON GATHERED ALL HIS PEOPLE TOGETHER</small>.</p>
<title>6.53 Numbers 21:21ff, Part XXV</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:25:) <small>ISRAEL TOOK ALL THESE TOWNS</small>. This text is related (to Is. 61:8): <small>BECAUSE I THE LORD LOVE JUSTICE, I HATE ROBBERY WITH A BURNT OFFERING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn861">207</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Moses (in Deut. 2:9): <small>DO NOT TROUBLE MOAB</small>. Now Heshbon had been part of Moab, since it is stated (in Numb. 21:26): <small>FOR HESHBON WAS A CITY OF KING SIHON OF THE AMORITES, BUT HE HAD FOUGHT AGAINST THE FORMER KING OF MOAB &#x003C;AND TAKEN ALL HIS LAND AWAY FROM HIM AS FAR AS THE ARNON&#x003E;</small>. When Israel came, they took Heshbon away from Sihon and whatever he had taken from the king of Moab; for if they had taken it from him &#x003C;directly&#x003E;, they would have had a robbery on their hands. Instead Sihon took it from Moab, and Israel took it from Sihon. Thus they were acquitted from &#x003C;the charge of&#x003E; robbery.</p>
<title>6.54 Numbers 21:21ff, Part XXVI</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:27:) <small>THEREFORE THOSE WHO SPEAK IN PARABLES SAY</small>: This refers to Balaam and his father, whom Sihon had hired to curse Moab. It was they who had said (ibid., cont.): <small>&#x003C;COME TO HESHBON,&#x003E; LET IT BE BUILT; LET THE CITY OF SIHON BE ESTABLISHED</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:28:) <small>FOR A FIRE HAS COME FORTH FROM HESHBON, &#x003C;A FLAME FROM THE CITY OF SIHON&#x003E;. IT HAS DEVOURED AR OF MOAB</small>. Thus they cursed Moab so that they might deliver it into &#x003C;Sihon&#x2019;s&#x003E; hand.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:29&#x2013;31:) <small>WOE BE TO YOU, O MOAB&#x0021;&#x2026;. WE HAVE SHOT AT THEM; HESHBON HAS PERISHED&#x2026;. THUS ISRAEL DWELT</small> &#x007B;<small>IN ALL THE CITIES</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN THE LAND OF</small>] <small>THE AMORITES</small>. &#x003C;Only&#x003E; Jazer survived.<sup><xref rid="fn862">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 21:32:) <small>SO MOSES SENT TO SPY OUT JAZER</small>. These spies were zealous. They said: we have confidence in the prayer of Moses, and we believe in the Holy One. Then they did &#x003C;as they were told&#x003E; and slew the Amorites who were in &#x003C;the city&#x003E;.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. Some say the war of Sihon took place in Elul. Then they celebrated the festival in Tishri,<sup><xref rid="fn863">209</xref></sup> then after the festival came the war with Og. [Just as you say] (in Deut. 16:7): <small>AND IN THE MORNING YOU SHALL TURN</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn864">210</xref></sup> while it is written (in Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. <italic>Gezerah shawah</italic> (a verbal analogy): Just as &#x003C;the turning comes&#x003E; after the festival below (in Deut. 16:7), so also here (in Numb. 21:33): <small>THEN THEY TURNED AND WENT UP</small>. &#x003C;Because of the similar use of the word <small>TURNED</small>, the contexts must have been similar; therefore the turning here in Numb. 21:33 must have taken place&#x003E; after the festival.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:33, cont.:) <small>AND KING OG OF BASHAN CAME OUT &#x003C;AGAINST THEM, HE AND ALL HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>, for the Holy One had gathered &#x003C;Og and his people&#x003E; before &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; in order to deliver &#x003C;Gog and his people&#x003E; into their hand.</p>
<title>6.55 Numbers 21:21ff, Part XXVII</title>
<p>(Numb. 21:34:) <small>BUT THE LORD GOD SAID UNTO MOSES: DO NOT FEAR HIM&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:14): <small>BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO IS ALWAYS AFRAID&#x2026;</small>. Such is the nature of the righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn865">211</xref></sup> Although the Holy One assures them, they do not cast off fear. And so it is written about Jacob (in Gen. 32:8 [7]): <small>AND JACOB WAS &#x003C;GREATLY&#x003E; AFRAID</small>. Why was he afraid? He said: Perhaps I was tainted by something at Laban&#x2019;s, since it is written (in Deut. 23:15 [14]): <small>&#x003C;AND YOUR CAMP SHALL BE HOLY;&#x003E; SO &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E; IS NOT TO SEE ANYTHING INDECENT AMONG YOU AND TURN AWAY FROM YOU</small>. Thus the Holy One may have forsaken me. Moses also acquired fear in the manner of his ancestor. Why was he afraid? He said perhaps Israel sinned in the war with Sihon or became tainted by a transgression. He said to him (in Numb. 34:21): <small>DO NOT FEAR HIM</small>, because a warrior more formidable than himself has never arisen in the world. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:11): <small>FOR ONLY KING OG OF BASHAN &#x003C;REMAINED FROM THE REPHAIM</small><sup><xref rid="fn866">212</xref></sup> <small>REMNANT&#x003E;</small>. Now he had been left from the warriors whom Amraphel and his colleagues (Gen. 14:1, 9) had slain, as stated (in Gen. 14:5): <small>&#x003C;CHEDORLAOMER AND THE KINGS WHO WERE WITH HIM CAME&#x003E; AND SMOTE THE REPHAIM&#x2026;</small>. But this man was their refuse, like hard olives that come out as survivors from the bottom of the olive waste. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:13): <small>THEN THE SURVIVOR CAME &#x003C;AND TOLD ABRAM THE HEBREW&#x003E;</small> (about Lot&#x2019;s capture).<sup><xref rid="fn867">213</xref></sup> It was this man&#x2019;s intention that Abraham would go out and be killed. The Holy One gave him a reward for &#x003C;what&#x003E; his feet &#x003C;had earned&#x003E;, in that he lived all those years, until he fell at the hand of &#x003C; Abraham&#x2019;s&#x003E; children. When Moses came to wage war with him, he was afraid of him. He said: I am a hundred and twenty years old, while he is five hundred years old. If he did not have merit, he would not have lived all these years. The Holy One said (in Numb. 21:34 &#x003D; Deut. 3:2:) <small>DO NOT FEAR HIM</small>. &#x007B;(Deut. 3:6:) <small>AND WE SHALL UTTERLY DESTROY THEM&#x2026;.</small> &#x007D; [(Numb. 21:34 &#x003D; Deut. 3:2, cont.:) <small>AND YOU SHALL DO TO HIM AS YOU DID TO SIHON&#x2026;</small>.] Moreover, is it not written (in Deut. 3:7): <small>BUT ALL THE CATTLE AND THE BOOTY OF THE TOWNS WE TOOK AS BOOTY FOR OURSELVES</small>? The simple conclusion is that they utterly destroyed his body so as to leave none of it.</p>
<p>(Numb. 21:35:) <small>SO THEY SMOTE HIM, HIS CHILDREN &#x003C;AND ALL HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. The written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) &#x003C;reads&#x003E; <small>HIS SON</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn868">214</xref></sup> because he had a son more formidable than himself. The Holy One said to Israel: In this world you destroy the nations little by little, but in the world to come, I will remove them from the world at a single stroke. It is so stated (in Is. 33:12): <small>AND THE PEOPLE SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE</small>.</p>

<title>Appendix to Chapter 6 Numbers, Parashah VIa: Supplement to <italic>Huggat</italic></title>
<title>6a.1 Numbers 19:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>From the parashah of the &#x003C;Red&#x003E; Heifer:<sup><xref rid="fn869">1</xref></sup> There was a story about R. Matthew bar Heresh. Now he was wealthy, feared Heaven, practiced virtuous beneficence, pursued good deeds of charity, and entertained the disciples of the sages from his own assets. Moreover, orphans and widows were always found at his table. All his paths were in uprightness, and like his master, R. Meir, he was occupied with the Torah all his days. So the radiance of his countenance shone like the brightness of the sun; and they said of him that at no time in his life had he ever looked at anyone&#x2019;s wife or at any other woman. On one occasion he was sitting and occupied with the Torah, when Satan passed by. Upon seeing him, he was envious of him. He said: Is it possible for a righteous person to exist in the world without sin&#x0021; Immediately he went up on high, where he stood before the Holy One and said: Sovereign of the World, how does Matthew ben Heresh stand before you? He said to him: Completely righteous. He said to him: Give me permission to test him. He gave him permission. Immediately he went and found him sitting and occupied with the Torah. He became like a beautiful woman, whose beauty had not been equalled since the the days of Naamah, the sister of Tubal Cain (of Gen. 4:22), through whom the ministering angels went astray. It is so stated (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE SONS OF GOD SAW HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE &#x003C;AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES&#x003E;</small>. When &#x003C;Matthew ben Heresh&#x003E; saw her, he turned his face away. Again Satan went opposite his face. He turned his face to another side, but Satan was opposite his face. When he saw that she was turning to &#x003C;face him on&#x003E; all sides, he said in his heart: I am afraid that the evil drive may prevail against me. So what did that righteous man do? He called one of his students to attend him. He said to him: Go, my son, and get me fire and pins&#x0021; When he had brought them, he ignited &#x003C;the pin&#x003E; in the fire and stuck them in his eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn870">2</xref></sup> When Satan saw that, he trembled in dismay. So he went away from him, ascended on high, where he said: Sovereign of the World, thus and such happened. Immediately the Holy One called Raphael (rt.: <italic><small>RP</small>h</italic>&#x2019;), Prince of the Healing Arts (rt.: <italic><small>RP</small>h</italic>&#x2019;) and said to him: Go and heal (rt.: <italic><small>RP</small>h</italic>&#x2019;) the eyes of Matthew ben Heresh. The angel Raphael went and stood by him. R. Matthew ben Heresh said: Who are you? He said to him: I am Raphael, the angel of the table of the Holy One, who has sent me to heal (rt.: <italic>RPh</italic>&#x2019;) your eyes. He answered him: I do not want &#x003C;healing&#x003E;. What happened happened. Raphael returned to the Holy One and said to him: Matthew ben Heresh told me thus and such. The Holy One said to him: Go, say to him: From this day on do not fear. I am standing surety for you in this matter, that the evil drive will never prevail against you all the days of your life. When he heard this from the mouth of the angel, he accepted his healing and was not afraid. Here is the origin of what the sages have said: Whoever does not look at another woman will not have the evil drive prevailing against him. Moreover, in the world to come the Holy One will remove the evil drive from us and set his Holy Spirit within us. It is so stated (in Ezek. 36:26&#x2013;27): <small>THEN I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH, AND I WILL PUT MY SPIRIT WITHIN YOU</small>.</p>
<title>6a.2 Numbers 20:23ff, Part I</title>
<p>From the parashah (in Numb. 20:25&#x2013;27): <small>TAKE AARON &#x003C;AND HIS SON ELEAZAR&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>AND STRIP AARON</small> [&#x2026;.: <small>SO MOSES DID AS THE LORD COMMANDED</small>. &#x003C;This parashah&#x003E; has come to teach you that, even though he had spoken to him a harsh commandment against his brother, he did not hesitate.<sup><xref rid="fn871">3</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Moses: Say to your brother Aaron: Your time has arrived to pass away from the world. Immediately Moses stood before the Holy One in prayer and said: Sovereign of the World, how shall I say to my brother: Your time has arrived. The Holy One said to him: I have already decreed a decision over him, that has not been decreed over anyone else, in that I will not deliver him into the hand of the angel of death on the same day that he stopped the plague (in Numb. 17:8&#x2013;13 [6:43&#x2013;48]). Now their custom was this: Every day the princes would rise and come early to the doorway of Eleazar; Eleazar and the princes &#x003C; would go&#x003E; to the doorway of Aaron; and Aaron, Eleazar, and the princes would go early to the doorway of Moses. On this day, however, Moses changed the custom. He along with Eleazar and the Princes went early to the doorway of Aaron. Aaron said to him: Brother Moses, Why did you change the custom? Moses said to him: This is what the Holy One has commanded me. Now this was the order in which they went: Moses in the middle with Aaron to his right and Eleazar to this left. But when Israel saw that, they said to each other: The Holy Spirit has been taken from Moses and given to Aaron&#x0021; Also Israel loved Aaron more than Moses, because Moses had said: Let justice take its course, while Aaron had brought peace between a person and his friend, also between a husband and his wife. Moreover, if he heard about anyone in the world who wanted to commit some transgression at night, he would go out on the road; and when he found him, he would say to him: My child, why are you walking on the road? People may suspect you of things that are evil. But you, my child, are a good person; and you stem from a good and distinguished family. Thus he would warn him and bring him back from an the evil way. So all Israel, men and women, loved Aaron. Therefore our masters of blessed memory have said (in <italic>Avot</italic> 1:12): <small>BE ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF AARON, LOVING PEACE AND PURSUING PEACE, LOVING MORTALS AND DRAWING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>. For that reason (in Numb. 20:29): <small>THEN ALL THE CONGREGATION SAW THAT AARON HAD DIED, AND THE WHOLE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>, men and women, <small>MOURNED AARON FOR THIRTY DAYS</small>. But in reference to Moses, it is written (in Deut. 34:8): <small>AND THE SONS OF ISRAEL</small>, men only, <small>MOURNED MOSES ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB FOR THIRTY DAYS</small>. Now on that day Aaron said to Moses: Tell me, my brother, what do you need from me? He said to him: Wait until we ascend the mountain. After they had ascended, he said to him: My brother, would it be that the Holy one entrusted a deposit with you, and wants it back from you? Aaron said to him: Brother Moses, a tent of meeting and its utensils were entrusted into my hands. Might I have cut back on their liturgy? Moses said to him: The Holy One delivered to you a menorah with its seven lamps. Still, he did not take to heart that he was speaking about his &#x003C;life&#x003E; breath (as in Prov. 20:27): <small>A PERSON&#x2019;</small>s <small>BREATH IS THE LAMP OF GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn872">4</xref></sup> When he was not perceptive about the matter, Moses said to him &#x003C;plainly&#x003E;: Brother Aaron, your time has arrived to pass away from the world. When he heard that, he put his hands on his head, as he sobbed and wept. Then he recited this scripture (from Ps. 66:5): <small>COME</small> &#x007B;<small>LOOK AT</small>&#x007D; [<small>SEE</small>] <small>THE WORKS OF GOD, WHO IS FEARSOME FOR HIS DEEDS AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ADAM</small>. Moreover, when they wanted to enter the cave, Moses said to him: Brother Aaron, there is where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob died; but since you wear the robes of priesthood, you may defile them. You put on Eleazar&#x2019;s clothes, and let Eleazar put on your clothes. Then you and I will enter the cave. And so they did. When they entered, they saw a burning lamp and a made-up bed. Moses said to him: Brother Aaron, get up into this bed, and he got up. He said to him: Extend your arms, and he extended them. Close your eyes, and he closed them. Close your mouth, and he did so. And in that hour his breath left him. When Moses saw that, he longed for his own death. The Holy One said to him: By your life, like this death, even the death of this man, so shall be your own death. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:50): <small>AND YOU SHALL DIE THERE ON THE MOUNTAIN THAT YOU ARE ASCENDING AND SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR KIN, AS YOUR BROTHER AARON DIED ON MOUNT HOR AND WAS GATHERED UNTO HIS KIN</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 7 Numbers, Parashah VII: <italic>Balaq</italic></title>
<title>7.1 Numbers 22:2ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:2:) <small>NOW BALAK BEN ZIPPOR SAW</small> (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C;ALL THAT ISRAEL HAD DONE TO THE AMORITES&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Deut. 32:4):<small>THE ROCK&#x0021;&#x2014;HIS WORK IS PERFECT, &#x003C;BECAUSE ALL HIS WAYS ARE JUSTICE&#x003E;</small>. [Thus] the Holy One did [not] leave the nations of the world a pretext for saying in the age to come: You alienated us and did not give us anything like what you gave Israel in this world.<sup><xref rid="fn873">1</xref></sup> [What] did the Holy One do? Just as he raised up kings, prophets, [and sages] for Israel, so did he raise them up from the nations of the world. Moreover, the kings, prophets, and sages [that belonged to Israel] were coupled with the kings, prophets, and sages that belonged to the nations of the world. He raised up Solomon as king over all the land, and he did the same for Nebuchadnezzar. The former built the Holy Temple, and the latter destroyed it. He gave David wealth, and he acquired the house for his name.<sup><xref rid="fn874">2</xref></sup> He gave wealth to Haman, and he acquired a whole nation for slaughter. Every dignity Israel received, you find that the nations of the world received. In like manner he raised up Moses for Israel, who spoke with him any time that he wanted, &#x003C;and&#x003E; he raised up Balaam for the nations of the world, in order that he might speak with him any time that he wanted. Look at (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>) what a difference there is between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world&#x0021; The prophets of Israel warn the nation about transgressions, and so it says (in Ezek. 3:17): <small>I HAVE APPOINTED YOU A SENTINEL FOR THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;Any&#x003E; prophet who arose from the nations, however, established a breach to cut off mortals from the world to come. And not only that, but all the prophets had a merciful attitude towards both Israel and the nations of the world; for so did Isaiah say (in Is. 16:11): <small>THEREFORE MY INNER PARTS THROB LIKE A HARP FOR MOAB&#x2026;</small>. And similarly has Ezekiel said (in Ezek. 27:2): <small>RAISE UP A DIRGE OVER TYRE</small>. But this cruel man rose up to uproot a whole nation without cause, for nothing. Therefore the parashah on Balaam was written to make known why the Holy One removed the Holy Spirit from the nations of the world. &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because this man arose out of them, and look (rt.: <italic><small>R&#x2019;H</small></italic>) at what he did&#x0021;</p>
<title>7.2 Numbers 22:2ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:2:) <small>NOW BALAK &#x003C;BEN ZIPPOR&#x003E; SAW</small>. He saw retribution which Israel inflicted against the Ammonites.<sup><xref rid="fn875">3</xref></sup> It would have been better for the wicked if they had been blind,<sup><xref rid="fn876">4</xref></sup> for their eyes bring a curse to the world. With reference to the generation of the flood, [it is written] (in Gen. 6:2): <small>THE SONS OF GOD SAW &#x003C;HOW BEAUTIFUL&#x003E; THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE &#x003C;AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES&#x003E;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 9:22): <small>THEN HAM, THE FATHER OF CANAAN, SAW &#x003C;THE NAKEDNESS OF HIS FATHER AND TOLD HIS TWO BROTHERS OUTSIDE&#x003E;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 12:15): <small>SO PHARAOH&#x2019;S COURTIERS SAW HER</small> (i.e., Abram&#x2019;s wife Sarah) <small>&#x003C;AND PRAISED HER TO PHARAOH, AND THE WOMAN WAS TAKEN TO PHARAOH&#x2019;S HOUSE&#x003E;</small>. [It is also written] (in Gen. 34:1&#x2013;2): <small>&#x003C;NOW LEAH&#x2019;S DAUGHTER DINAH WENT OUT&#x2026;.&#x003E; THEN SHECHEM BEN HAMOR &#x003C;THE HIVITE, THE PRINCE OF THE LAND,&#x003E; SAW HER&#x2026;.</small> So also &#x003C;here&#x003E; (in Numb. 22:2): <small>NOW BALAK &#x003C;BEN ZIPPOR&#x003E; SAW</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to someone who appointed guards to guard from an invader; and he had confidence in them, because they were warriors. When the invader came over and killed them, he trembled with fear for himself. It was the same also with Balak. When he saw what happened with Sihon and Og to whom he had been sending payment to guard him, he was afraid for himself. And in addition to that, he had seen the miracles at the wadies of Arnon.<sup><xref rid="fn877">5</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.3 Numbers 22:2ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:3:) <italic><small>WAYYAGOR MO&#x2019;AV</small></italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn878">6</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <italic><small>WAYYAGOR</small></italic> (rt.: <italic><small>YGR</small></italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn879">7</xref></sup> When &#x003C;Israel&#x003E; appeared to the Ammonites, they appeared clothed for peace. To the Moabites they appeared armed &#x003C;for battle&#x003E;. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 2:19): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR THE FRONTIER OF THE CHILDREN OF AMMON, DO NOT TROUBLE THEM</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>GRH</small></italic>) <small>THEM</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>DO NOT TROUBLE THEM</small>] with all kinds of trouble, <small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>GRH</small></italic>) <small>THEM</small> with any kind of provocation. In regard to Moab, however, he said (in Deut. 2:9): <small>DO NOT TROUBLE MOAB</small>, [<small>AND DO NOT PROVOKE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>GRH</small></italic>) <small>THEM WITH WAR</small>]. Whatever you can seize apart from &#x003C;war&#x003E;, seize. For that reason they appeared armed, and &#x003C;the Moabites&#x003E; gathered themselves (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>GR</small></italic>) to their cities, as stated (in Numb. 22:3): <small>NOW MOAB <italic>YAGOR</italic></small> (i.e., <small>GATHERED</small>). <italic><small>WAYYAGOR</small></italic> (rt.: <italic><small>YGR</small></italic>, here understood a form of &#x2019;<italic><small>GR</small></italic>) can only be a word for a gathering, just as it says (in Prov. 10:5): <small>A PRUDENT CHILD GATHERS</small> (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>GR</small></italic>) <small>IN THE SUMMER</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:3): <italic><small>WAYYAGOR</small></italic>. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; a word for fear, in that they were afraid because of &#x003C;Israel&#x003E;.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:3, cont:) <small>AND MOAB HAD A HORROR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QWT</small>s</italic>) <small>&#x003C;OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>, because they saw themselves as a &#x003C;mere&#x003E; thorn (<italic><small>QWT</small>s</italic>) over against them.</p>
<title>7.4 Numbers 22:2ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:4:) <small>SO MOAB SAID UNTO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small>. What is the relevance of &#x003C;mentioning&#x003E; the <small>ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small> here?<sup><xref rid="fn880">8</xref></sup> It is simply that they saw Israel conquering in a way that was not customary for conquerors. They said: Their leader (i.e., Moses) was raised in Midian. Let us learn through them what his character is like. The elders of Midian said to them: His power is only in his mouth. They said to them: We also will bring someone against them who has power in his mouth.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:4:) <small>SO MOAB SAID UNTO THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN</small>. Do you not find that the Midianites were at war with the Moabites? It is so stated (in Gen. 36:35): <small>&#x003C;AND HADAD BEN BEDAD,&#x003E; WHO SMOTE MIDIAN IN THE PLAIN OF MOAB, &#x003C;REIGNED IN HIS PLACE&#x003E;</small>. Moreover, the hatred between them had existed from time immemorial. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable [to two] dogs who were hostile to each other.<sup><xref rid="fn881">9</xref></sup> A wolf came against one of them. His companion said: If I do not help him, &#x003C;the wolf&#x003E; will kill this &#x003C;dog&#x003E; today. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; tomorrow he will come against me. Therefore Moab formed an alliance with Midian.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>NOW THIS HORDE WILL LICK UP ALL THAT IS AROUND US AS THE OX LICKS UP &#x003C;THE GRASS OF THE FIELD&#x003E;</small>. Just as the ox has its power in its mouth, so do they have their strength in their mouth. Just as everything an ox licks up has no sign<sup><xref rid="fn882">10</xref></sup> of fertility, &#x003C;so&#x003E; also whatever these lick up have no sign of fertility. Just as an ox gores with its horns, &#x003C;so&#x003E; also it is with these (according to Deut. 33:17): <small>AND HIS HORNS ARE THE HORNS OF A WILD OX, &#x003C;AND WITH THEM HE GORES THE NATIONS&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>NOW BALAK BEN ZIPPOR WAS KING OF MOAB</small>. But was he not formerly a prince, as stated (in Josh. 13:21): <small>EVI, REKEM, ZUR, HUR, AND REBA, PRINCES OF SIHON&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn883">11</xref></sup> It is simply that when Sihon was killed they made him king in his place.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) <small>AT THAT TIME</small>. When that time was ripe for him.</p>
<title>7.5 Numbers 22:2ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:5:) <small>AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO BALAAM BEN BEOR AT PETHOR</small>. &#x003C;Pethor (<italic>petor</italic>) was&#x003E; the name of his city.<sup><xref rid="fn884">12</xref></sup> But others say that &#x003C;the name implies&#x003E; he was a money-changer,<sup><xref rid="fn885">13</xref></sup> since the kings of the nations of the world took counsel with him, as the money-changer to whom they all would rush. Still others say that in the beginning he was an interpreter (<italic>poter</italic>) of dreams. He turned to being a diviner. Then he turned to the Holy Spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn886">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>TO THE LAND OF HIS KINSFOLK</small>, for Balak came from there; and &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; had told him: Your destiny is to become king.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>TO SUMMON HIM</small>. Thus he wrote him: Do not suppose that it is for myself alone that you are doing this and that I alone am honoring you. If you uproot them, you shall receive honor from all the nations, so that the Canaanites and the Egyptians shall all bow down to you.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE THAT HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT</small>. He said to him: As for you, how does it concern you? He said to him (in Numb. 22:5, cont.): <small>LOOK, THEY HAVE COVERED THE FACE</small> (literally: <small>EYE</small>) <small>OF THE EARTH</small>. &#x003C;There are&#x003E; two eyes upon which the earth depends, Sihon and Og.

<p>(Numb. 22:6:) <small>SO COME NOW PLEASE, CURSE</small> (<italic>arah</italic>) <small>&#x003C;THIS PEOPLE&#x003E; FOR ME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>CURSE</small> (&#x2019;<italic><small>RH</small></italic>) &#x2026; <small>FOR ME</small>? Perhaps I shall be able to control them little by little, like someone who picks (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>RH</small></italic>) figs.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>FOR THEY ARE MIGHTIER THAN I</small>. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; not that they are more valiant than I, nor &#x003C;is it&#x003E; that their forces are more numerous than mine. It is simply that they conquer through their mouth, &#x003C;and this is&#x003E; something that I cannot do.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO SMITE THEM</small>. What reason was there for this one to engage them (i.e., Israel) in war? Did not the Holy One tell them this, that were not to take any of their land? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; simply that &#x003C;Balak&#x003E; was more of a master of sorceries and divinations than Balaam, for it is so written of him (in Numb. 22:2): <small>NOW BALAK &#x003C;BEN ZIPPOR&#x003E; SAW</small> (in a vision), except that he did not really comprehend the things &#x003C;he saw&#x003E;. And so it says (in Is. 47:13&#x2013;14): <small>YOU ARE WEARIED WITH YOUR MANY DELIBERATIONS; LET THOSE WHO STUDY THE HEAVENS PLEASE STAND UP AND SAVE YOU; LET THOSE WHO GAZE AT THE STARS MAKE KNOWN MONTH BY MONTH WHATEVER WILL COME UPON YOU. SEE THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE STRAW; &#x003C;FIRE CONSUMES THEM&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> When he saw that Israel would fall into his hand, he therefore gave his daughter over (to prostitution);<sup><xref rid="fn888">16</xref></sup> and through her twenty-four thousand fell. To this end he would have engaged them in war, but he did not know how. (Numb. 22:6:) <small>PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO SMITE</small> (<italic><small>NKH</small></italic>) <small>THEM</small>. As one discounts (rt.: <italic><small>NKH</small></italic>) one twenty-fourth of a <italic>seah</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn889">17</xref></sup> so also did there fall from Israel twenty-four thousand, one &#x003C;thousand&#x003E; less &#x003C;than should have fallen&#x003E;. &#x007B;Interpretation: 24 X 20,000 &#x003D; 480,000, and 24 X 5,000 &#x003D; 120,000, It turns out that, if 25,000 is found to be 1/24 of 600,000 and only 24,000 fell, then 1,000 are missing.&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn890">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>AND DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM THE LAND</small>, for he only desired to drive them away, so that they would not enter the land.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:6, cont.:) <small>FOR I KNOW THAT WHOMEVER YOU BLESS IS BLESSED AND THAT WHOMEVER YOU CURSE IS CURSED</small>. Where is it shown that he knew? When Sihon desired to fight with Moab &#x003C;and&#x003E; was afraid because they were warriors, he hired Balaam and his father to curse Moab, for it says (in Numb. 21:27&#x2013;29): <small>THEREFORE THOSE WHO SPEAK IN PARABLES SAY: &#x003C;COME TO HESHBON, LET IT BE BUILT; LET THE CITY OF SIHON BE ESTABLISHED&#x003E;&#x2026;. FOR A FIRE HAS COME FORTH FROM HESHBON, &#x003C;A FLAME FROM THE CITY OF SIHON. IT HAS DEVOURED AR OF MOAB&#x003E;&#x2026;. WOE BE TO YOU, O MOAB&#x0021;</small>&#x2026;. Ergo it says (In Numb. 22:6): <small>FOR I KNOW &#x003C;THAT WHOMEVER YOU BLESS IS BLESSED AND THAT WHOMEVER YOU CURSE IS CURSED&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>7.7 Numbers 22:2ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:7:) <small>SO THE ELDERS OF MOAB AND THE ELDERS OF MIDIAN WENT WITH &#x003C;THE TOOLS FOR&#x003E; DIVINATION IN THEIR HAND</small>, for they brought in their hands all kinds of divining instruments through which one divines, so as not to give him an excuse &#x003C;for not coming&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn891">19</xref></sup> So the divining instruments were in the hands of the elders of Midian, for they said: If he comes with us, he will succeed; but if he delays &#x003C;even&#x003E; for an hour, he will be of no use. As soon as they saw that he said (in vs. 8): Lodge here tonight, the elders of Midian went away, because they knew through their divinations that they were of no use.<sup><xref rid="fn892">20</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.8 Numbers 22:2ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:9:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AND SAID: WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU?</small> This text is related (to Prov. 28:10): <small>ONE WHO LEADS THE UPRIGHT ASTRAY ON AN EVIL COURSE</small> [<small>WILL FALL INTO HIS OWN PIT</small>]. Thus at first mortals [behaved] with propriety, but because of his (Balaam&#x2019;s) words, they became unbridled in sexual matters.<sup><xref rid="fn893">21</xref></sup> Thus of former &#x003C;generations&#x003E; [it is written] (in Gen. 29:9): <small>RACHEL CAME WITH THE SHEEP</small>. (Exod. 2:16): <small>NOW THE PRIEST OF MIDIAN HAD SEVEN DAUGHTERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn894">22</xref></sup> Balaam the Wicked arose and led mortals astray into unchastity; but as he led &#x003C;others&#x003E; astray, he &#x003C;himself&#x003E; was led astray. By the &#x003C;very&#x003E; counsel he gave, he &#x003C;himself&#x003E; fell. [This is what is written] (in Prov. 28:10): <small>&#x003C;ONE WHO LEADS THE UPRIGHT ASTRAY ON AN EVIL COURSE&#x003E; WILL FALL INTO HIS OWN PIT</small>. So the Holy One led him astray, as stated (in Job 12:23): <small>HE EXALTS THE NATIONS AND DESTROYS THEM. HE ENLARGES THE NATIONS AND LEADS THEM AWAY</small>. &#x003C;When the Holy One&#x003E; asked him (in Numb. 22:9): <small>WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU</small>? That Wicked one said: I know nothing about them, except that (according to vss. 10&#x2013;11): <small>KING BALAK BEN ZIPPOR OF MOAB SENT &#x003C;THIS MESSAGE&#x003E; UNTO ME: BEHOLD THE</small> (<italic>sic</italic>) <small>PEOPLE HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT &#x2026;; &#x003C;COME NOW, CURSE</small> (<italic>qavah</italic>) <small>THEM FOR ME. PERHAPS I SHALL BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THEM AND DRIVE THEM AWAY FROM THE LAND&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to make known that he (Balaam) hated Israel more then Balak, because (in Numb. 22:6) Balak did not say <italic>qavah</italic> (as Balaam claimed he had said in Numb. 22:11) but <italic>arah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn895">23</xref></sup> This one (Balaam), however, explicitly said: <small>CURSE</small> (<italic>qavah</italic>) (in vs. 11). Moreover, while the former (Balak) said (in Numb. 22:6): <small>AND DRIVE THEM AWAY &#x003C;FROM THE LAND&#x003E;</small>, the latter (Balaam) said &#x003C;simply&#x003E; (in vs. 11): <small>AND DRIVE THEM OUT</small> &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; from this world and from the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn896">24</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.9 Numbers 22:2ff, Part IX</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:12:) <small>THEN GOD SAID UNTO BALAAM: YOU SHALL NOT GO WITH THEM</small>. He said to him: If that is the case, I will curse them from where I am.<sup><xref rid="fn897">25</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT CURSE THE PEOPLE</small>. He said to him: Let me bless them. He said to him: They do not need your blessing, (Ibid., cont.:) <small>FOR THEY ARE BLESSED</small>. Similarly one says to a hornet: None of your honey and none of your sting.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:13:) <small>SO BALAAM AROSE IN THE MORNING AND SAID TO THE PRINCES OF BALAK: GO UNTO YOUR OWN LAND&#x2026;</small>. Balaam did not tell them: The Holy One did not give me permission either to go or to curse. &#x003C;He&#x003E; simply &#x003C;said&#x003E; (Ibid., cont.:): <small>THE LORD REFUSED TO LET ME GO WITH YOU</small>. He said to me: It is not in accord with your honor to go with these people. Rather &#x003C;you must go&#x003E; with people greater then they, since he takes pleasure in my being honored. (Numb. 22:14:) <small>SO THE PRINCES OF MOAB AROSE AND</small> &#x007B;<small>WENT</small>&#x007D; [<small>CAME</small>] <small>UNTO BALAK AND SAID: BALAAM HAS REFUSED TO GO WITH US</small>. Therefore (in vs. 15): <small>ONCE AGAIN BALAK SENT PRINCES, MORE NUMEROUS AND MORE HONORABLE THAN THE FIRST ONES</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:16&#x2013;17:) <small>THEN THEY CAME UNTO BALAAM AND SAID TO HIM: THUS HAS BALAK BEN ZIPPOR SAID: &#x003C; PLEASE DO NOT REFRAIN FROM COMING UNTO ME.&#x003E; FOR I WILL SURELY HONOR YOU GREATLY</small>. &#x003C;Even&#x003E; more than what you [wanted] formerly I will give you. Moreover, everything that you desire and whatever you ordain I will do.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:18:) <small>BUT BALAAM ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO THE</small> &#x007B;<small>PRINCES</small>&#x007D; [<small>SERVANTS</small>] <small>OF BALAK: &#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; IF BALAK SHOULD GIVE ME &#x003C;A HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD, I COULD NOT TRANSGRESS THE COMMAND OF THE LORD MY GOD TO DO LESS OR MORE&#x003E;</small>. From here you learn that he had &#x007B;a haughty spirit, an evil eye&#x007D; [an evil eye, a haughty spirit], a greedy soul:<sup><xref rid="fn898">26</xref></sup> An evil eye, since it is stated (in Numb. 24:2): <small>THEN BALAAM RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ISRAEL DWELLING TRIBE BY TRIBE</small>. A haughty spirit, &#x003C;since&#x003E; (according to Numb. 22:13): <small>&#x003C;SO BALAAM AROSE IN THE MORNING AND SAID TO THE PRINCES OF BALAK: GO UNTO YOUR OWN LAND, FOR&#x003E; THE LORD REFUSED TO LET ME GO WITH YOU</small>. A greedy soul, &#x003C;since&#x003E; (according to Numb. 22:18): <small>&#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; IF BALAK SHOULD GIVE ME</small> [<small>A HOUSE FULL OF SILVER AND GOLD</small>].</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>I COULD NOT TRANSGRESS</small> [<small>THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small>] <small>&#x003C;MY GOD&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;He was&#x003E; prophesying that he could not annul the blessings with which the ancestors had been blessed by the mouth of the Divine Presence.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:19:) <small>NOW YOU ALSO PLEASE STAY HERE TONIGHT</small>, because in the end you will go in disappointment like the former &#x003C;messengers&#x003E;.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO THAT I MAY KNOW WHAT ELSE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>YSP</small></italic>) <small>THE LORD &#x003C;MAY SAY TO ME&#x003E;</small>. Thus he prophesied that the Holy One was going to multiply (rt.: <italic><small>YSP</small></italic>) blessings for them at his hands.</p>
<title>7.10 Numbers 22:2ff, Part X</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:20:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AT NIGHT</small>. This text is related (to Job 33:15&#x2013;17): <small>IN A DREAM</small>, &#x007B;<small>IN</small>&#x007D; <small>A VISION OF THE NIGHT &#x2026;, THEN HE UNCOVERS A HUMAN EAR &#x2026;, TO TURN AWAY</small> &#x007B;<small>AN ACTION FROM A PERSON</small>&#x007D; [<small>A PERSON FROM AN ACTION</small>] <small>AND CONCEAL PRIDE FROM A MAN</small>. What did he <small>CONCEAL&#x003C;&#x2026;. &#x003E; FROM A MAN?</small><sup><xref rid="fn899">27</xref></sup> The Holy One hid from him (i.e, from Balaam) that his going (with Balak&#x2019;s messengers) would obliterate him from the world and bring him to the grave; for when someone is going to sin, Satan dances before him until he completes the transgression. As soon as he has obliterated him,<sup><xref rid="fn900">28</xref></sup> he returns to inform him. Thus it is stated (in Prov. 7: 22&#x2013;23): <small>GOING AFTER HER RIGHT AWAY, &#x003C;HE COMES LIKE AN OX TO THE SLAUGHTER&#x003E; &#x2026;, UNTIL AN ARROW PIERCES HIS LIVER</small>. So did the Holy One hide &#x003C;obliteration from Balaam, until he had gone and destroyed his soul. After he had taken leave of his honor, had gone and destroyed his soul, and realized how he stood, he began to beg for his soul (saying in Numb. 23:10): <small>LET MY SOUL DIE THE DEATH OF THE RIGHTEOUS</small>.</p>
<title>7.11 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XI</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:20:) <small>THEN GOD CAME UNTO BALAAM AT NIGHT</small>. This text is related (to Exod. 12:42): <small>THAT WAS FOR THE LORD A NIGHT OF VIGIL TO BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT, THAT WAS THIS VERY NIGHT</small>. All miracles which were done for Israel and which involved exacting retribution for them from the wicked took place at night.<sup><xref rid="fn901">29</xref></sup> (Gen. 31:24:) <small>AND GOD CAME UNTO LABAN THE ARAMEAN IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>. (Gen. 20:3:) <small>BUT GOD CAME UNTO ABIMELECH</small> [<small>IN A DREAM AT NIGHT</small>]. (Exod. 12:29:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT</small>. (Exod. 14:20:) <small>THUS THERE WAS THE CLOUD AND THE DARKNESS WHICH LIT UP THE NIGHT</small>. (Gen. 14:15:) <small>AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn902">30</xref></sup> And &#x003C;so it was with&#x003E; all of them (as in Exod. 12:42): <small>A NIGHT OF VIGIL</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Why did he reveal himself to him (i.e., Balaam) by night? He was not worthy of &#x003C;receiving&#x003E; the Holy Spirit [except at night], because he speaks at night with all the prophets of the star worshipers. And so Eliphaz (traditionally non-Jewish) says (in Job 4:13): <small>IN OPINIONS FROM NIGHT VISIONS</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:20, cont.:) <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>. As soon as he had become defiant, then it is stated (in Numb. 22:22): <small>BUT GOD</small>&#x2019;s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING</small>. The Holy One said: You wicked man&#x0021; I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked. In as much as you want to be obliterated from the world, <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:20), cont.:) <small>BUT ONLY THE THING</small> [<small>THAT I TELL YOU ARE TO DO</small>]. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach you that he went with a warning. Immediately he got up early in the morning (according to vs. 21): S<small>O BALAAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, SADDLED HIS</small> &#x007B;<small>HE</small>-&#x007D; [<small>SHE</small>-] <small>ASS, &#x003C;AND WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB&#x003E;</small>. Did he not have a male or female slave? It was simply that hatred for Israel came first for him. So he arose quickly all by himself. The Holy One said to him: You wicked man&#x0021; Their ancestor Abraham has already anticipated you at the binding of his son Isaac. (Ergo Gen. 22:3:) <small>SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING, &#x003C;SADDLED HIS HE-ASS&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:21), cont.:) <small>AND WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach you that he was glad at the tribulation of Israel.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:22:) <small>BUT GOD</small>&#x2019;s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING, AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD TOOK A STAND</small> [<small>IN THE ROAD AS HIS ADVERSARY</small> (<italic>satan</italic>)].<sup><xref rid="fn903">31</xref></sup> He was an angel of mercy, but to &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; he had become an adversary (<italic>satan</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn904">32</xref></sup> And so he said [unto] Balaam:You have caused me to practice a skill that is not my own, as stated (Numb. 22:32): <small>HERE I HAVE COME OUT AS AN ADVERSARY</small> (<italic>satan</italic>).</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:22, cont.:) <small>AND TWO OF HIS SERVANT BOYS WERE WITH HIM</small>. This is customary for one going out on the road. It is necessary for two to attend him. Then in turn they attend each other.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:23:) <small>NOW THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD</small>. Was not the angel able to breathe on him and take away his spirit? Instead, he drew his sword. And look at what is written about Sennacherib (in II Kings 19:35 &#x003D; Is. 37:36 // II Chron. 32:21.): <small>&#x003C;SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THAT NIGHT&#x003E; THAT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD WENT OUT AND SMOTE &#x003C;ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FIVE THOUSAND&#x003E; IN THE CAMP OF ASSYRIA&#x2026;</small>. It is also written (in Is. 40:24): <small>HE BLOWS ON THEM AND THEY WITHER</small>. However, he said to him: &#x003C;Skill with&#x003E; the mouth was given to Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 27:22): <small>THE VOICE IS THE VOICE OF JACOB, BUT THE HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF ESAU</small>; but the nations all live by the sword. Now you are trading off your skill and coming against them with their &#x003C;skill&#x003E;. I also am coming against you with your own &#x003C;skill&#x003E;.</p>
<title>7.12 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XII</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:24:) <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD IN A LANE BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS</small>. Could he not have gone after him into the field?<sup><xref rid="fn905">33</xref></sup> It is simply that this is the nature of the Holy One. When a king of flesh and blood sends an executioner<sup><xref rid="fn906">34</xref></sup> to kill a particular person, he goes after him for many days, so that this person who has incurred the penalty of death &#x003C;continues&#x003E; eating and drinking, while the executioner goes after him from place to place. With the Holy One, however, it is not like that. Rather the executioner is in his place and whoever has incurred the penalty of death comes to him of his own accord. So that the angel would not be bothered with going after Balaam, he simply went ahead of him on the road, for it is so written (ibid.): <small>THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STOOD IN A LANE BETWEEN THE VINEYARDS&#x2026;</small>. He said to him: Shall the vineyards (i.e., Israel) be sold among the foxes?<sup><xref rid="fn907">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 22:24, cont.:) <small>WITH A WALL ON ONE SIDE AND A WALL ON THE OTHER SIDE</small>. You cannot prevail against them, because in their hand (according to Exod. 32:15) are <small>TABLETS WRITTEN</small> [<small>ON BOTH THEIR SIDES</small>], <small>ON THE ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY ARE WRITTEN</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:25&#x2013;26:) <small>WHEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, SHE WAS PRESSED &#x003C;AGAINST THE WALL AND PRESSED BALAAM&#x2019;</small>s <small>FOOT AGAINST THE WALL; SO HE STRUCK IT AGAIN&#x003E;. THEN THE ANGEL OF THE LORD MOVED FORWARD AGAIN &#x003C;AND STOOD IN A PLACE SO NARROW THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT&#x003E;</small>. What reason did he have to go ahead of him three times? He showed him here symbols of the &#x003C; three&#x003E; patriarchs. When he stood before him the first time, there was space on one side and on the other, [as stated] (in Numb. 22:23): <small>SO THE SHE-ASS TURNED ASIDE FROM THE ROAD</small>. On the second occasion she could only move to one side. On the third occasion (according to Numb. 22:26) <small>THERE WAS NO ROOM TO TURN ASIDE TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT</small>. So what do the symbols mean?</p>
<ol>
<li>If he ever sought to curse the children of Abraham, he would find the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah on one side and on the other.</li>
<li>&#x003C;If&#x003E; he sought to curse the children of Isaac, he would find the children of Esau on one side, and (according to Numb. 22:25) <small>SHE WAS PRESSED AGAINST THE WALL</small>.</li>
<li>In the case of the children of Jacob, however, he found among them no defect with which to touch them. It is therefore written about the third occasion (in vs. 26): <small>IN A PLACE SO NARROW</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Numb. 22:27:) <small>WHEN THE SHE-ASS SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD, SHE LAY DOWN UNDER BALAAM. &#x003C;SO BALAAM</small>&#x2019;s <small>ANGER WAS KINDLED,&#x003E; AND HE STRUCK THE SHE-ASS WITH A STICK</small> (<italic><small>MQL</small></italic>), because of the shame with which she had shamed him.<sup><xref rid="fn908">36</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.13 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:28:) <small>THEN THE LORD OPENED THE MOUTH OF THE SHE-ASS</small>, in order to make known to you that the mouth and the tongue are under his (i.e., the Holy One&#x2019;s) control, so that if he desired to curse, his mouth was under his control.<sup><xref rid="fn909">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.: <small>AND SHE SAID TO BALAAM: WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE STRUCK ME THESE THREE TIMES</small> (<italic>shalosh regalim</italic>)? She intimated to him: You are seeking to uproot a people that celebrate three pilgrimage festivals (<italic>shalosh regalim</italic>) in the year&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:29:) <small>BUT BALAAM SAID TO THE SHE-ASS: YOU HAVE TRULY MADE A FOOL OF ME&#x0021;</small> Even though he was a star worshiper, he spoke in the holy tongue. A star worshiper has a foul tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn910">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>IF I HAD A SWORD IN MY HAND, I WOULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW</small>. &#x003C;The situation &#x003E; is comparable to a physician who came to cure with his tongue a person bitten by a snake on the road. On the way he saw a lizard. He began searching for a stick to kill it. They said to him: Are you unable to get this &#x003C;creature&#x003E; (without a stick)? How do you come to cure with your tongue a person bitten by a snake? Similarly, the she-ass said to Balaam: You cannot kill me unless you have a sword in your hand. How do you intend to uproot an entire people&#x0021; He was silent and could not find an answer. The princes of Moab began to express astonishment, for they had seen a miracle the like of which had never happened in the world. Now there are some who say that he said to them: She is not mine. &#x003C;The ass&#x003E; answered him (in Numb. 22:30): <small>AM I NOT YOUR SHE-ASS, UPON WHICH YOU HAVE RIDDEN ALL YOUR LIFE LONG UNTIL THIS DAY&#x0021;</small> Here you learn that he was not an old man, since &#x003C;the ass&#x003E; was older than he.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:30, cont.:) <small>HAVE I EVER BEEN IN THE HABIT OF DOING THIS TO YOU?</small> As soon as she had spoken, she died, so that the people would not say: This is the one that spoke, and make it an object of reverence.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 22:30): The Holy One had respect for the honor of that wicked man, lest they would say: This is the very one that removed Balaam.</p>
<title>7.14 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XIV</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:31:) <small>THEN THE LORD UNCOVERED THE EYES OF BALAAM AND HE SAW &#x003C;THE ANGEL OF THE LORD&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Was he blind?<sup><xref rid="fn911">39</xref></sup> &#x003C;These words were&#x003E; simply to inform him that even the eye is under in his power.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>THEN HE BOWED DOWN AND PROSTRATED HIMSELF ON HIS FACE</small>, because &#x003C;the angel&#x003E; had spoken with him.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:32:) <small>AND THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM: &#x003C;WHY DID YOU STRIKE YOUR SHE-ASS THESE THREE TIMES &#x003E;</small>? Did the the angel come to seek satisfaction at his hand for the she-ass? He said to him: Now if for the she-ass, which has neither its own merit nor merit from ancestors, I have been commanded to claim satisfaction from your hand, how much the more so for an entire people that you have come to uproot&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:32, cont.:) <small>HERE I HAVE COME OUT AS AN ADVERSARY</small> (<italic>satan</italic>), <small>BECAUSE YOUR WAY IS CONTRARY</small> (<italic><small>YRT</small></italic>) <small>TO ME</small>. &#x003C;<italic><small>YRT</small></italic> is interpreted as an acronym concerning the ass for&#x003E; <italic>yare&#x2019;ah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn912">40</xref></sup> (she feared), <italic>ra&#x2019;atah</italic> (she saw), <italic>natetah</italic> (she turned away).</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:33:) <small>FOR THE SHE-ASS SAW ME AND TURNED AWAY FROM ME THESE THREE TIMES. IF SHE HAD NOT TURNED AWAY FROM ME, SURELY JUST NOW I WOULD HAVE KILLED YOU AND LET HER LIVE</small>. From here you have learned that he killed the ass.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:34:) <small>THEN BALAAM SAID UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE LORD: I HAVE SINNED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach you that he was completely evil. He knew that no one stands facing divine punishment without repentance; for whenever anyone sins and says: I have sinned, the angel has no authority to touch him.</p>
<p>(Ibid.:) <small>BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW</small>. Although that wicked man was praising him and had knowledge of the most high, his mouth bore witness and said (in Numb. 22:34): <small>I DID NOT KNOW</small>.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND NOW, IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES, I WILL RETURN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn913">41</xref></sup> He said to him: I did not go until the Holy One said to me (in Numb. 22:20): <small>ARISE AND GO WITH THEM</small>; yet you are saying that I should return&#x0021; &#x003C;Indeed&#x003E; such is his practice&#x0021; Similarly, did he not tell Abraham to sacrifice his son? Then after that &#x003C;it is stated&#x003E; (in Gen. 22:11&#x2013;12): <small>BUT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CALLED UNTO HIM &#x003C;OUT OF THE HEAVENS AND SAID: ABRAHAM&#x0021; ABRAHAM&#x0021; AND HE SAID: HERE AM I.&#x003E; THEN HE SAID: DO NOT RAISE YOUR HAND &#x003C;AGAINST THE LAD&#x003E;</small>. He is used to saying something, then to have an angel come and reverse it. He said to me (in Numb. 22:20): <small>GO WITH THEM</small>; but now (in vs. 34), <small>IF IT IS EVIL IN YOUR EYES, I WILL RETURN</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:35:) <small>THE ANGEL OF THE LORD SAID UNTO BALAAM: GO WITH THE MEN</small>; for your lot is &#x003C;to be&#x003E; with them, and your end is to be obliterated with them from the world.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>SO BALAAM WENT WITH THE PRINCES OF BALAK</small>. [&#x003C;These words&#x003E; teach that just as they were happy to curse &#x003C;Israel&#x003E;, so was he happy.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:36:) <small>WHEN BALAK HEARD THAT BALAAM HAD COME</small>.] &#x003C;These words&#x003E; teach that he sent messengers unto Balak to tell him the good news.<sup><xref rid="fn914">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM UNTO THE CITY OF MOAB</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; unto their metropolis.<sup><xref rid="fn915">43</xref></sup> What was &#x003C;Balak&#x2019;s&#x003E; reason for preceding him to the borders? He said to him: These are borders which have been fixed from the days of Noah, so that a nation would not enter the territory of its neighbor. These &#x003C;people&#x003E; are coming to despoil. Then he showed him how they had broken through and crossed the border of Sihon,<sup><xref rid="fn916">44</xref></sup> as though lodging a complaint against them.</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:37:) <small>THEN BALAK SAID UNTO BALAAM: DID I NOT TRULY SEND UNTO YOU &#x003C;TO SUMMON YOU? WHY DID YOU NOT COME UNTO ME?&#x003E; AM I REALLY UNABLE TO HONOR YOU&#x003E;?</small> He prophesied that his end would be to go in disgrace. Then did Balaam also answer him concerning the matter (in Numb. 22:38:) <small>SO BALAAM SAID UNTO BALAK: SEE, I HAVE COME UNTO YOU NOW, BUT AM I REALLY ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING AT ALL?</small> for I do not have authority to say what I want.</p>
<title>7.15 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XV</title>
<p>(Numb. 22:39:) <small>THEN BALAAM WENT UNTO</small><sup><xref rid="fn917">45</xref></sup> <small>BALAK, AND THEY CAME UNTO KIRIATH-HUZOTH</small> (literally: <small>CITY OF MARKETS</small>), where he had made market places for buying and selling.<sup><xref rid="fn918">46</xref></sup> He had also made a bazaar.<sup><xref rid="fn919">47</xref></sup> &#x003C;His purpose was&#x003E; to show him crowds<sup><xref rid="fn920">48</xref></sup> and say: What are those people coming to kill? Children and infants, who have done no wrong?</p>
<p>(Numb. 22:40:) <small>THEN BALAK SACRIFICED AN OX AND A SHEEP</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn921">49</xref></sup> The righteous say little and do much.<sup><xref rid="fn922">50</xref></sup> It is written of Abraham (in Gen. 18:5): <small>LET ME BRING A PIECE OF BREAD</small>; but after that (in vs. 6&#x2013;7): <small>HURRY UP WITH THREE <italic>SE&#x2019;AHS</italic> &#x003C;OF FINE MEAL&#x003E;&#x2026;. THEN ABRAHAM RAN UNTO THE HERD&#x2026;.</small> But the wicked say a lot and do little. Barak said (in Numb. 22:17): <small>FOR I WILL SURELY HONOR YOU GREATLY&#x2026;</small>. When &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; came, he only sent him an ox and a sheep. Balaam began gnashing his teeth at him, for he was greedy.<sup><xref rid="fn923">51</xref></sup> He spoke thus: Is this what he sent me? Tomorrow I will deliver a curse through his own property, as stated (in Numb. 23:1): <small>THEN BALAAM SAID</small> [<small>UNTO BALAK</small>]: <small>BUILD &#x003C;SEVEN ALTARS&#x003E; FOR ME HERE, &#x003C;AND MAKE READY FOR ME HERE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small></p>
<p>(Numb. 22:41:) <small>SO IT CAME TO PASS IN THE MORNING THAT BARAK TOOK BALAAM AND BROUGHT HIM UP TO THE HIGH PLACES OF BAAL, &#x003C;AND FROM THERE HE SAW THE EDGE OF THE PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. Balak was a more of a master of divinations and auguries than Balaam, for Balaam was being dragged along after him like a blind man.<sup><xref rid="fn924">52</xref></sup> What did the two of them resemble? Someone who had a knife in his hand but did not know &#x003C;where to find&#x003E; the &#x003C;animal&#x003E; joints, while his companion knew the joints but did not have a knife in his hand. Barak saw the places in which Israel would fall and (ibid.:) <small>BROUGHT HIM UP INTO THE HIGH PLACES OF BAAL</small>. This was Baal Peor, where he saw that Israel would fall.</p>
<title>7.16 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XVI</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:1:) <small>THEN BALAAM SAID</small> [<small>UNTO BALAK</small>]: <small>BUILD &#x003C;SEVEN ALTARS&#x003E; FOR ME HERE, &#x003C;AND MAKE SEVEN BULLS AND SEVEN RAMS READY FOR ME HERE&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> Why seven altars? &#x003C;They&#x003E; corresponded to seven righteous ones from Adam to Moses, who built seven altars and had been accepted: Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Then &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; said: Why did you accept these? Was it not because of a liturgy which they performed before you that you accepted them? Is it not &#x003C;more&#x003E; suitable for you to be served by seventy nations and not by &#x003C;merely&#x003E; one nation? The Holy Spirit answered him (in Prov. 17:1): <small>BETTER A DRY MORSEL WITH TRANQUILITY THAN A HOUSE FULL OF QUARRELSOME FEASTING</small>. Better (in the words of Lev. 7:10) <small>A GRAIN OFFERING MIXED WITH OIL OR DRY</small> than (in Prov. 17:1) <small>A HOUSE FULL OF QUARRELSOME FEASTING</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn925">53</xref></sup> for you want to introduce strife between me and Israel.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:2&#x2013;3:) <small>THEN BALAK DID AS BALAAM HAD</small> &#x007B;<small>SAID</small>&#x007D; [<small>COMMANDED</small>]. <small>&#x003C;SO BALAK AND BALAAM OFFERED A BULL AND A RAM ON EACH ALTAR&#x003E;. THEN BALAAM SAID &#x003C;TO BALAK&#x003E;: STAND BESIDE &#x003C;YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS, AND LET ME GO. PERHAPS THE LORD WILL COME TO MEET ME, AND WHATEVER HE SHOWS ME I WILL TELL YOU.&#x003E; SO HE WENT ALONE</small> (rt.: <italic>Sh<small>PH</small></italic>). &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; had been at ease (rt.: <italic>ShPH</italic>) about cursing. Thus he had been at ease until that moment, but from that moment on he was troubled.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:4:) <small>THEN GOD ENCOUNTERED BALAAM</small>. The Holy One said to him: You evil man&#x0021; What are you doing?<sup><xref rid="fn926">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND &#x003C;BALAAM&#x003E; SAID UNTO HIM: I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &#x003C;AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a money-changer who lies about the weights. When the head of the market place came, he noticed him. He said to him: Why are you breaking the law and lying about the weights? &#x003C;The money changer&#x003E; said to him: I have already sent a gift<sup><xref rid="fn927">55</xref></sup> to the house of my lord. So also it was in the case of Balaam. The Holy Spirit cried out to him. It said to him: You Evil Man&#x0021; What are you doing. He said to it (in Numb. 23:4): <small>I HAVE PREPARED THE SEVEN ALTARS &#x003C;AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR&#x003E;</small>. It said to him (in Prov. 15:17): <small>BETTER A MEAL OF VEGETABLE GREENS</small> [<small>WHERE THERE IS LOVE THAN A FATTENED OX WITH HATRED IN IT</small>]. &#x003C;Better&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn928">56</xref></sup> the dinner of unleavened bread and bitter herbs which Israel ate in Egypt, than bulls which you offer with hands of [hatred]. &#x007B;Thus it is stated:&#x007D; (Numb. 23:5:) <small>SO THE LORD PUT A <italic>DAVAR</italic> IN BALAAM</small>&#x2019;s <small>MOUTH</small>, which twisted his mouth and pierced it,<sup><xref rid="fn929">57</xref></sup> as one would drive a nail into a board. R. Eliezer (understanding <italic><small>DAVAR</small></italic> as <small>WORD</small>) says: An angel was speaking, while R. Joshua (understanding <italic><small>DAVAR</small></italic> as <small>THING</small>) says: &#x003C;His mouth&#x003E; was pierced with a hook.<sup><xref rid="fn930">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 23:5&#x2013;6:) <small>&#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; AND SAID: RETURN UNTO BALAK AND SPEAK THUS. SO HE RETURNED UNTO HIM, AND THERE HE WAS STANDING BESIDE HIS BURNT OFFERINGS &#x003C;WITH ALL THE PRINCES OF MOAB&#x003E;</small>, who stood anxiously awaiting &#x003C;the time&#x003E; when he would come.</p>
<title>7.17 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XVII</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:7:) <small>SO HE TOOK UP HIS THEME AND SAID: IT IS FROM ARAM THAT BALAK HAS BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST</small>. I was one of the exalted ones,<sup><xref rid="fn931">59</xref></sup> but Balak has brought me down to the pit of corruption.<sup><xref rid="fn932">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>(ibid.:) <small>BROUGHT ME</small> (<italic>yanheni,</italic> rt.: <italic><small>NHH</small></italic>) &#x003C;is to be understood&#x003E; just as you say (in Ezek. 32:18): <small>BRING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NHH</small></italic>) <small>THE MASSES OF EGYPT AND CAST THEM DOWN &#x2026; &#x003C;UNTO THE LOWEST PART OF THE NETHERWORLD ALONG WITH THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE PIT&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn933">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7): <small>FROM ARAM</small>. I was with the highest (<italic>ram</italic>) of the high, and Balak has brought me down from my glory. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to one who was walking with the king. When he saw &#x003C;some&#x003E; robbers,<sup><xref rid="fn934">62</xref></sup> he left the king and toured along with the robbers. When he returned to be with the king, he said to him: Go with whomever you have toured with, because it not possible for you to walk again with me. Similarly Balaam had been bound to the Holy Spirit. When he paired himself with Balak, the Holy Spirit departed from him. So he returned to being a diviner as in the beginning. Thus it is stated (at his execution in Josh. 13:22): <small>BALAAM</small> [<small>BEN BEOR</small>] <small>THE DIVINER</small>. Therefore did he cry: I was high up (<italic>ram</italic>), and Balak brought me down.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:7): <small>&#x003C;IT IS&#x003E; FROM ARAM &#x003C;THAT BALAK&#x003E; HAS BROUGHT ME</small>. &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; said to &#x003C;Balak&#x003E;: We are alike, even both of us, for being ungrateful, because were it not for our father Abraham, there would have been no Balak. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 19:29): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN GOD DESTROYED THE CITIES OF THE PLAIN, GOD REMEMBERED ABRAHAM AND SENT LOT AWAY</small>. Except for Abraham, he would not have delivered Lot from Sodom; and you are one of the children of the children of Lot.<sup><xref rid="fn935">63</xref></sup> Moreover, if it were not for their father Jacob, I should not have been present in the world, because Laban had sons only through the merit of Jacob, since it is written at the beginning (in Gen. 29:9): <small>RACHEL CAME WITH THE SHEEP</small>. Now if he had sons, how was his daughter a shepherdess? As soon as Jacob came there, sons were given to him, as stated (in Gen. 31:1): <small>NOW HE HEARD THE THINGS THAT LABAN</small>&#x2019;s <small>SONS &#x003C;WERE SAYING&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn936">64</xref></sup> (Gen. 30:27:) <small>BUT &#x003C;LABAN&#x003E; SAID &#x003C;UNTO HIM&#x003E; &#x2026; I HAVE LEARNED BY DIVINATION THAT THE LORD HAS BLESSED ME FOR YOUR SAKE</small>. So if it were not for their ancestors, you and I would not have been present in the world.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:7, cont.:) <small>COME, PLEASE</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn937">65</xref></sup> <small>CURSE &#x003C;JACOB&#x003E; FOR ME</small>. Whoever curses them (i.e., the children of Jacob) is cursing himself, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:3): <small>AND THE ONE WHO CURSES YOU, I WILL CURSE</small>. It also says (in Gen. 27:29): <small>CURSED BE THOSE WHO CURSE YOU</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn938">66</xref></sup> <small>AND BLESSED BE THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:7:) <small>COME, CURSE &#x003C;JACOB&#x003E; FOR ME</small>. If you had told me to curse another people, for example, [the children of] Abraham and Isaac, I would have been able &#x003C;to do so&#x003E;. But Jacob? When a king selects a portion for himself, and someone else gets up and speaks disparagingly about it, will he keep his life? Now these people are his heritage, his portion, and his treasure. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 32:9): <small>FOR THE LORD</small>&#x2019;s <small>SHARE IS HIS PEOPLE; JACOB THE PORTION OF HIS HERITAGE</small>. (Exod. 19:5:) <small>AND YOU SHALL BE MY TREASURE FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLES&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:7, cont.:) <small>AND COME, DENOUNCE ISRAEL</small>. When a king takes a crown and puts it on his head, and someone says of it that it is nothing, will he keep his life? Now in regard to these people it is written about them (in Is. 49:3): <small>ISRAEL, IN WHOM I WILL BE GLORIFIED</small>.</p>
<title>7.18 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XVIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:8:) <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small> When they deserved to be cursed, they were not cursed. When Jacob went in to receive the blessings, as written (in Gen. 27:16): <small>THEN &#x003C;SHE CLOTHED HIS ARMS AND THE HAIRLESS PART OF HIS NECK&#x003E; WITH THE SKINS OF GOAT KIDS</small>. His father said to him (in Gen. 27:18): <small>WHO ARE YOU</small>? He said to him (in vs. 19): <small>I AM ESAU, YOUR FIRST-BORN</small>. Does not the one who puts forth a lie with his mouth deserve to be cursed? Yet not only &#x003C;was he not cursed&#x003E;, but he was blessed, as stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>HE SHALL ALSO BE BLESSED</small>. So how do I curse (in the words of Numb. 23:8) <small>WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED</small>?</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8): [<small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>] According to universal custom, when a legion<sup><xref rid="fn939">67</xref></sup> rebels against the king, it incurs the penalty of death. Now since these denied and revolted against him, when they said to the calf (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>, did they not, therefore, deserve to have him destroy them at that time? &#x003C;Still&#x003E; he did not cease to cherish them. Instead he had clouds of glory accompany them. Nor did he withhold from them the manna and the well. And so it says (in Neh. 9:18&#x2013;20): <small>EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD MADE THEMSELVES A MOLTEN CALF &#x2026;, YOU IN YOUR GREAT MERCIES DID NOT</small> &#x007B;<small>UTTERLY DESTROY THEM</small>) [<small>ABANDON THEM IN THE DESERT&#x2026;</small>. ] <small>AND YOU DID NOT WITHHOLD YOUR MANNA FROM THEIR MOUTH</small>. How can I curse them? This &#x003C;question&#x003E; is related (to Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small></p>
<p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small>] When he commanded them concerning the blessings and the curses, he mentioned them (as <small>THE PEOPLE</small>) in connection with the blessings where it is stated (in Deut. 27:12): <small>THESE SHALL STAND &#x003C;ON MOUNT GERIZIM&#x003E; FOR BLESSING THE PEOPLE</small>; but he did not claim them in connection with the curses. Thus it is stated (in vs. 13): <small>AND THESE SHALL STAND ON MOUNT EBAL FOR THE CURSE</small>. Moreover, when they sin and say they have brought a cursed state upon themselves, it is not written that he himself is bringing them (i.e., the individual curses); but with respect to the blessings, he &#x003C;himself&#x003E; is blessing them, for so it says (in Deut. 28:1): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF YOU DILIGENTLY OBEY &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;, THE LORD YOUR GOD WILL SET YOU HIGH &#x003C;OVER ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH&#x003E;</small>. (vs. 8:) <small>THE LORD WILL COMMAND THE BLESSING TO BE WITH YOU</small>. With respect to the curses (according to Deut. 28:15): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT, IF YOU DO NOT OBEY</small> [&#x2026;], <small>THEN &#x003C;ALL THESE CURSES&#x003E; SHALL COME UPON YOU</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; of their own accord. Ergo (in Numb. 23:8): <small>HOW SHALL I CURSE WHOM GOD HAS NOT CURSED?</small></p>
<title>7.19 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XIX</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:9:) <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS I SEE HIM</small>, in order to make the hatred of that evil man (i.e., Balaam) known to you, from whose blessings you may know his thoughts. To what is he comparable? To someone who came to chop down a tree. One who is not an expert chops the branches off one at a time and becomes tired, but the clever one exposes the roots and &#x003C;then&#x003E; chops it down. Similarly that wicked man said: How shall I curse each and every tribe? Rather I will go to their roots. When he came to touch them, he found them hard &#x003C;to cut&#x003E;. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 23:9): <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS &#x003C;I SEE HIM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>[Another interpretation] (of Numb. 23:9): <small>FOR FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCKS &#x003C;I SEE HIM&#x003E;</small>. These are the patriarchs. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND FROM THE HILLS I BEHOLD HIM</small>. These are the matriarchs.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:9, cont.:) <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE DWELLING ALONE</small>. When he makes them rejoice, no nation rejoices along with them. Rather they are all afflicted, [as stated] (in Deut. 32:12): <small>THE LORD ALONE DID LEAD HIM</small>, [<small>AND THERE WAS NO FOREIGN GOD WITH HIM</small>]. But when the nations are rejoicing in this world, they (i.e., the children of Israel) eat with each and every kingdom, and no one is charging &#x003C;such pleasures&#x003E; against their account (rt: <italic><small>HS</small>h<small>B</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn940">68</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Numb. 23:9, cont.): <small>AND THEY SHALL NOT BE RECKONED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HS</small>h<small>B</small></italic>) <small>AMONG THE NATIONS</small>.</p>

(Gen. 16:3:) <small>SO ABRAHAM</small>&#x2019;s <small>WIFE SARAI TOOK HER MAIDSERVANT HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN &#x2026; &#x003C;AND GAVE HER TO HER HUSBAND ABRAHAM AS A WIFE&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:10, cont.:) <small>LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE UPRIGHT</small>. &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a butcher who came to slaughter a cow that belonged to a king. The king began to take notice. When &#x003C;the butcher&#x003E; realized &#x003C;what was happening&#x003E;, he began by discarding the knife, then giving &#x003C;the cow&#x003E; a rubdown and filling the feeding trough for it. He began to say: Let my life be forfeit for coming [to steal it; but observe that I have provided fodder for it. Similarly Balaam said: Let my life be forfeit for coming] to curse, but I will bless &#x003C;them&#x003E;. Ergo (in Numb. 23:10): <small>LET ME DIE THE DEATH OF THE UPRIGHT, AND LET MY END BE LIKE THEIRS&#x0021;</small></p>
<title>7.21 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XXI</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:14:) <small>SO HE TOOK HIM TO THE FIELD OF ZOPHIM</small> [<small>AT THE TOP OF PISGAH</small>]. He saw that Israel would be breached there, for it was there that Moses died, as stated (in Deut. 3:27): <small>GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH &#x2026;, &#x003C;FOR YOU SHALL NOT CROSS OVER THIS JORDAN&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn944">72</xref></sup> Is there a breach greater than this? What he saw was through divinations, and he was of the opinion that because of him they would fall there.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:14, cont., 16, 17:) <small>AND HE BUILT SEVEN ALTARS &#x003C;AND OFFERED A RAM AND A BULL ON EACH ALTAR&#x003E;. THEN HE SAID UNTO BALAK: STAND HERE &#x003C; BESIDE YOUR BURNT OFFERINGS AND LET ME MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE TO THE LORD OVER THERE&#x003E;&#x2026;. SO HE</small> &#x007B;<small>RETURNED</small>&#x007D; [<small>CAME</small>] <small>UNTO HIM, AND THERE HE WAS STANDING BESIDE HIS BURNT OFFERINGS TOGETHER WITH THE PRINCES OF MOAB</small>. Concerning the first occasion, it is written (in Numb. 23:6): <small>WITH ALL THE PRINCES OF MOAB</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn945">73</xref></sup> When they saw that they had derived no benefit at all, they left him; and only a small portion of the princes of Moab were left with him.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:17:) <small>BALAK SAID TO HIM: WHAT DID THE LORD SAY</small>? When he saw that &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; was not in control of himself to say what he wanted, &#x003C;Balak&#x003E; sat down himself and mocked him. As soon as he saw that he was mocking him, Balaam said to him: Get up from there. It is not fitting to sit while the words of the Omnipresent are being spoken. (Numb. 23:18:) <small>RISE UP BALAK AND LISTEN; GIVE EAR TO ME, YOU SON OF ZIPPOR</small> (literally: <small>HIS SON IS ZIPPOR</small>)&#x0021; Both of them were distinguished sons of undistinguished fathers, for they had made themselves greater than their fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn946">74</xref></sup> (Numb. 24:3:) <small>AN ORACLE OF BALAAM SON OF BEOR</small> (literally: <small>HIS SON IS BEOR</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn947">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 23:19:) <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN, THAT HE SHOULD SPEAK FALSEHOOD</small>. He is not like flesh and blood. &#x003C;When a person of&#x003E; [flesh and blood] acquires friends and finds others nicer than they, he forsakes the former ones. But &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; is not like that. It is not possible for him to be false to the oath of the early ancestors.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>HAS HE PROMISED AND NOT FULFILLED</small>? When he promises to bring evils upon them, he will cancel them, if they have repented. You find it written (in Exod. 22:19 [20]): <small>WHOEVER SACRIFICES TO A GOD &#x003C;OTHER THAN GOD ALONE&#x003E; SHALL BE DEVOTED TO DESTRUCTION</small>. When they made the calf, did they not merit destruction? So I was of the opinion that he would curse and destroy them; but when they repented a little, he suspended &#x003C;any punishment&#x003E; <small>AND</small> (according to Exod. 32:14) <small>THE LORD REPENTED OF THE EVIL &#x003C;WHICH HE HAD PLANNED TO DO TO HIS PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>7.22 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XXII</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:21:) <small>NO ONE HAS BEHELD FALSEHOOD IN JACOB</small>. Balaam said: He has neither paid attention to the transgressions at their hands nor at their pride.<sup><xref rid="fn948">76</xref></sup> (Numb. 23:21, cont.:) <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn949">77</xref></sup> You (Balak) said to me (in Numb. 23:7): <small>COME, CURSE &#x003C;JACOB&#x003E; FOR ME</small>. If an orchard has no keeper, a thief is able to harm it; or if the keeper falls asleep, the thief will enter &#x003C;it&#x003E;. But in the case of these people (according to Ps. 121:4): <small>BEHOLD, THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP</small>. So how can I harm &#x003C;Israel&#x003E;? (Numb. 23:21:) <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH HIM</small> (i.e., Moses). Balak said to him: Since you cannot touch them because of Moses, their minister, look at his successor. What will he be? He said to him: He also will be strong like him. (Numb. 23:21:) <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH HIM</small> (i.e., Joshua); <small>A ROYAL WAR CRY IS WITHIN HIM</small>. He is blowing &#x003C;a trumpet&#x003E;, giving a war cry, and throwing down a wall.<sup><xref rid="fn950">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 23:22:) <small>GOD BRINGS THEM OUT OF EGYPT</small>. You said to me (in Numb. 22:5): <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE THAT HAS COME OUT OF EGYPT</small>. That is not so. Rather he brought them out by himself.</p>
<p>(Ibid., cont.:) <small>LIKE THE HEIGHTS</small><sup><xref rid="fn951">79</xref></sup> <small>OF HIS LOFTINESS</small> (<italic><small>R</small>&#x2019;<small>M</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn952">80</xref></sup> Such is his nature. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they sinned a little, he brought them down like a bird, as stated (in Hos. 9:11): <small>EPHRAIM</small>&#x2019;s <small>GLORY SHALL FLY AWAY LIKE A BIRD</small>. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they are worthy, he raises them up and exalts (rt.: <italic><small>RWM</small></italic>) them on high like a bird. Thus it is stated (in Is. 60:8): <small>WHO ARE THESE THAT FLY LIKE A CLOUD</small>?</p>
<title>7.23 Numbers 22:2ff, Part XXIII</title>
<p>(Numb. 23:23:) <small>SURELY THERE IS NO AUGURY IN JACOB AND NO DIVINATION IN ISRAEL</small>. Here you are (Balak) practicing augury and divining in what place you may prevail against them, but they are not like that. When they have to fight against enemies, a high priest stands up and puts on Urim and Thummim, which are asked about the &#x003C;will of&#x003E; Holy One. So all the gentiles practice divination and augury, but these (Israelites) prove them false through repentance and nullify their divinations. It is so written (in Is. 44:25): <small>WHO FRUSTRATES OMENS OF LIARS AND CONFOUNDS DIVINERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn953">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 23:23, cont:) <small>NOW IT IS SAID FOR JACOB AND FOR ISRAEL: WHAT HAS GOD DONE?</small> His (i.e., Balaam&#x2019;s) eye saw that Israel was sitting (<italic>yoshevim</italic>) before the Holy One like a pupil before his master and was hearing why each and every parashah was written; and so it says (in Is. 23:18): <small>FOR HER</small><sup><xref rid="fn954">82</xref></sup> <small>PROFITS SHALL BELONG TO THOSE WHO DWELL</small> (<small><italic>YOSHEVIM</italic></small>) <small>BEFORE THE LORD&#x2026;</small>. It also says (in Is. 30:20): <small>AND NO MORE SHALL YOUR TEACHER HIDE HIMSELF, FOR YOUR EYES SHALL SEE YOUR TEACHER</small>. The ministering angels will ask them: What has the Holy One taught you, because they cannot enter their (i.e., Israel&#x2019;s) precincts, as stated (in Numb. 23:23): <small>NOW IT IS SAID FOR JACOB AND FOR ISRAEL: WHAT HAS GOD DONE</small>?</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:24:): <small>HERE IS A PEOPLE RISING UP LIKE A LION</small>. You have no nation in the world like them. Here they are sleeping away from the Torah and the commandments. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; having risen from their sleep, they stand up like lions. Quickly reciting the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2019;, they proclaim the sovereignty of the Holy One. Then having become like lions, they embark on worldly business pursuits. If one of them should stumble, or if destroying demons come to touch one of them, he proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn955">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 23:24, cont.:) <small>IT</small> (a lion) <small>DOES NOT SLEEP UNTIL IT HAS EATEN ITS PREY</small>. When he (the reader) says (in the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018; of Deut. 6:4): <small>THE LORD IS ONE</small>, the destroying demons are destroyed on his account, and they intone after him (as the liturgical response): <small>AND BLESSED BE THE NAME OF HIS GLORIOUS KINGDOM FOREVER AND EVER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn956">84</xref></sup> Moreover, through the recitation of the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018; he is sustained from the the day watch to the night watch.<sup><xref rid="fn957">85</xref></sup> Thus when he goes to sleep, he entrusts he spirit into the hand of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 31:6[5]: <small>INTO YOUR HAND I ENTRUST MY SPIRIT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn958">86</xref></sup> Then when he awakens &#x003C;and&#x003E; proclaims the sovereignty of the Holy One, the night watch transfers him to the day watch. Thus it is stated (Ps. 130:6): <small>MY SOUL BELONGS TO THE LORD FROM &#x003C;THE TIME OF&#x003E; THE MORNING WATCH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn959">87</xref></sup> For that reason Balaam said: There is no nation like this one.</p>
<p>(Numb. 23:24, cont.:) <small>AND DRUNK THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN</small>. He prophesied that Moses would not sleep (in his grave), until he had taken vengeance on himself and on the five kings of Midian. (Numb. 23:24:) <small>IT DOES NOT SLEEP UNTIL IT HAS EATEN ITS PREY</small>. This &#x003C;prey&#x003E; is Balaam. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND DRUNK THE BLOOD OF THE SLAIN</small>. These are the five kings of Midian. (Numb. 31:6:) <small>WITH THE VESSELS</small> [<small>OF THE SANCTUARY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn960">88</xref></sup> This is] the &#x003C;high priestly diadem&#x003E; plate on which it is said (according to Exod. 28:36): <small>HOLY TO THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn961">89</xref></sup> (Numb. 31:6, cont.:) <small>AND THE TRUMPETS FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM IN HIS HAND</small>. Moses said to Israel: Balaam the Wicked has practiced magic for you<sup><xref rid="fn962">90</xref></sup> and is making the five kings fly. So he flies and makes &#x003C;others&#x003E; fly. Show him the &#x003C;high priestly diadem&#x003E; plate on which the name of the Holy One is engraved,<sup><xref rid="fn963">91</xref></sup> and they will fall down before you. You know that it is so written (in Numb. 31:8): <small>AND ALONG WITH THEIR &#x003C;OTHER&#x003E; VICTIMS THEY KILLED THE KINGS OF MIDIAN: &#x003C;EVI, REKEM, ZUR, HUR, AND REBA, THE FIVE KINGS OF MIDIAN,&#x003E; &#x003C;THEY ALSO KILLED&#x003E; BALAAM BEN BEOR &#x003C;WITH THE SWORD&#x003E;</small>. What did that wicked man want with the kings of Midian? Is it not in fact written (in Numb. 24:25): <small>&#x003C;THEN BALAAM AROSE&#x003E; AND WENT BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE?</small> It is simply this: When he heard that twenty-four thousand &#x003C;Israelites&#x003E; had fallen (in Numb. 25:9) through his counsel,<sup><xref rid="fn964">92</xref></sup> he returned to get his reward. For that reason Balaam ben Beor is recorded (in Numb. 31:8) together with the five kings of Midian.</p>
<title>7.24 Numbers 24:3ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 24:3:) <small>SO HE TOOK UP HIS THEME AND SAID</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn965">93</xref></sup> Let our master instruct us:<sup><xref rid="fn966">94</xref></sup> In the case of one who eats without washing his hands, what penalty will he incur?<sup><xref rid="fn967">95</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: Washing hands before the meal is an option; after the meal it is an obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn968">96</xref></sup> It once happened in a time of religious persecution that there was one of the Israelite shopkeepers who would cook and sell both clean meat and pork, so that they would not notice that he was a Jew. Now his custom was this: Whenever anyone came into his shop and did not wash his hands, he knew that he was a star worshiper and would set pork before him; but whenever anyone washed his hands and recited the blessing, he knew that he was a Jew and would serve him clean meat. Once a certain Jew came in to eat there but did not wash his hands. Thinking that he was a star worshiper, he set pork before him. He ate without saying the blessing (after the meal). When he came to settle the account with him for the bread and for the meat, the pork was expensively priced. He said to him: I have such and such against you over the meat which you have eaten, for the slice is worth ten minas.<sup><xref rid="fn969">97</xref></sup> He said to him: Yesterday you gave it to me for eight. Now today you want ten&#x0021; He said to him: This which you ate is from a hog. When he said this to him, his hair stood on end, for he became terrified and afraid. He said to him privately: I am a Jew and you have given me pork. He said to him: A curse on you&#x0021; When I saw that you ate without washing your hands and without a blessing, I thought that you were were a star worshiper. Hence the sages have said: The &#x003C;omission of&#x003E; the first water (before the meal) caused him to serve him pork; &#x003C;the neglect of&#x003E; the latter water (after the meal) took a life.<sup><xref rid="fn970">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a story about a certain person who ate pulse without washing his hands. When he went down to the market place, his hands were filthy from the pulse. When an acquaintance of his saw him, he went and said to his wife: Your husband has mentioned as a token<sup><xref rid="fn971">99</xref></sup> to you &#x003C;of my authenticity&#x003E; that he has just now eaten pulse.<sup><xref rid="fn972">100</xref></sup> Send him that ring. After a time her husband came. He said to her: Where is the ring? She said to him: So and so came with your tokens, and I gave it to him. Becoming filled with rage, he arose and killed her. Therefore, whoever does not wash his hands after the meal is like one who takes a life. Therefore, the Holy One has warned Israel not to transgress even insignificant commandments, as stated (in Deut. 32:47): <small>FOR IT</small> (the Torah) <small>IS NO EMPTY THING FOR YOU, IN THAT IT IS YOUR VERY LIFE</small>. Even some commandment that you consider to be empty and insignificant has within it life and length of days. The Holy One said to Israel: If you keep my commandments, I will cast down your enemies before you, as stated (in Ps. 81:14&#x2013;15[13&#x2013;14]): <small>O THAT MY PEOPLE WOULD LISTEN TO ME, THAT ISRAEL WOULD WALK IN MY WAYS. THEN I WOULD VIRTUALLY SUBDUE THEIR ENEMIES&#x2026;</small>. When Balaam saw how Israel observed &#x003C;even&#x003E; the insignificant commandments, he said: Who can curse these people, when they observe commandments and when his name is engraved upon them. It is so stated (in Numb. 23:21: <small>THE LORD THEIR GOD IS WITH THEM</small>. Whoever curses them curses himself, because his name is joined with them.<sup><xref rid="fn973">101</xref></sup> He began turning to oracles.</p>
<p>(Numb. 24:3:)<sup><xref rid="fn974">102</xref></sup> <small>SO HE UTTERED HIS ORACLE</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 27:14): <small>WHOEVER RISES EARLY IN THE MORNING TO BLESS HIS NEIGHBOR IN A</small> &#x007B;<small>SHRILL</small>&#x007D; [<small>LOUD</small>] <small>VOICE SHALL HAVE IT RECKONED TO HIM AS A CURSE</small>. When Balaam came to curse Israel, the Holy One diverted his tongue, so that he began to bless. It is so stated (in Deut. 23:6 [5]): <small>BUT THE LORD YOUR GOD DID NOT WANT TO HEED BALAAM; SO THE LORD YOUR GOD TURNED THE CURSE INTO A BLESSING FOR YOU</small>. The Holy One put power in his voice and his voice went from one end of the world to the other, so that the nations would hear that he was blessing &#x003C;Israel&#x003E;. Now it is stated concerning him (in Prov. 27:14): <small>WHOEVER &#x003C;RISES EARLY IN THE MORNING TO&#x003E; BLESS HIS NEIGHBOR IN A</small> &#x007B;<small>SHRILL</small>&#x007D; [<small>LOUD</small>] <small>VOICE &#x003C;SHALL HAVE IT RECKONED TO HIM AS A CURSE&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This verse refers to the fact&#x003E; that he had said (in Numb. 24:14): <small>COME, LET ME ADVISE YOU</small>. Then he killed twenty-four thousand.<sup><xref rid="fn975">103</xref></sup> Is there &#x003C;any&#x003E; curse like this?</p>
<title>7.25 Numbers 25:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:1:) <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM, &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING&#x003E;</small>. Let our master instruct us: By virtue of how many things was Israel redeemed from Egypt?<sup><xref rid="fn976">104</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: Israel was redeemed from Egypt by virtue of four things: (1) that they did not change their name, (2) that they did not change their language, (3) that they did not disclose their secrets,<sup><xref rid="fn977">105</xref></sup> and (4) they were not unbridled in unchastity.<sup><xref rid="fn978">106</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>That they did not change their name. Thus Reuben and Simeon went down (to Egypt), and Reuben and Simeon (with no name change) came up (from Egypt).</li>
<li>And they did not change their language, as stated (in Gen. 45:12): <small>THAT IT IS MY MOUTH</small> (i.e., <small>MY LANGUAGE</small>) <small>WHICH IS SPEAKING UNTO YOU</small>. Thus they were talking in the sacred tongue.</li>
<li>That they did not reveal their secrets, when Moses said to them (in Exod. 3:22): <small>BUT EACH WOMAN SHALL BORROW &#x003C;OBJECTS OF SILVER, OBJECTS OF GOLD, AND CLOTHING&#x003E; FROM HER NEIGHBOR &#x003C;AND FROM THE WOMAN WHO SOJOURNS IN HER HOUSE&#x003E;</small>. Now the command was entrusted to them for twelve months, but they never revealed it to the Egyptians.</li>
<li>And they were not unbridled in unchastity, as stated (in Cant. 4:12): <small>A LOCKED GARDEN IS MY SISTER, MY BRIDE, A LOCKED FOUNTAIN</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn979">107</xref></sup> <small>A SEALED SPRING</small>. (ibid.:) <small>A LOCKED GARDEN</small>. These are the males. <small>A LOCKED FOUNTAIN, A SEALED SPRING</small>. These are the females. You yourself know that it is so, since there was &#x003C;but&#x003E; one exception and Scripture aired her case (in Lev. 24:10&#x2013;11): <small>NOW THERE WENT OUT THE SON OF AN ISRAELITE WOMAN, &#x003C;WHOSE FATHER WAS AN EGYPTIAN</small> &#x003E; [&#x2026;. <small>AND THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER WAS SHELOMITH BAT DIBRI OF THE TRIBE OF DAN</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn980">108</xref></sup> Now in all those forty years that they were in the desert, they never committed the sin of unchastity, until they came to Shittim. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:1): <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM, &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING&#x003E;. AT SHITTIM</small>, because they had committed folly (<italic>shetut</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn981">109</xref></sup> as stated (in Prov. 6:32): <small>ONE WHO COMMITS ADULTERY WITH A WOMAN HAS NO SENSE</small>.</li>
</ol>
<title>7.26 Numbers 25:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:1:) <small>WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM, &#x003C;THE PEOPLE BEGAN &#x003C;TO GO WHORING&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> There are springs that rear warriors, and there are those that rear weaklings<sup><xref rid="fn982">110</xref></sup> Some are handsome and some ugly; [some are modest] and some lecherous. The spring of Shittim was one of whoredom and it watered Sodom. You find that it says (in Gen. 19:5): <small>&#x003C;AND THEY CALLED UNTO LOT AND SAID TO HIM:&#x003E; WHERE ARE THE MEN</small> &#x2026;? &#x003C; <small>BRING THEM OUT UNTO US THAT WE MAY KNOW THEM</small>.&#x003E; Because that spring was cursed, the Holy One is going to dry it up &#x003C;and then renew it&#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn983">111</xref></sup> as stated (in Joel 4:18[3:18]): <small>THEN A SPRING SHALL ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHALL WATER THE WADI OF THE ACACIAS</small> (<italic>Shittim</italic>). From the days of Abraham they were never unbridled in unchastity, until they came to Shittim and drank of its water. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 25:1): <small>&#x003C;WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM,&#x003E; THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:1): <small>THE PEOPLE BEGAN</small>. Every place that <small>THE PEOPLE</small> is mentioned, it is an expression of shame; but every place that Israel is mentioned, it is a word of commendation.<sup><xref rid="fn984">112</xref></sup> (Numb. 11:1:) <small>NOW THE PEOPLE WERE AS MURMURERS SPEAKING EVIL IN THE</small> &#x007B;<small>EYES</small>&#x007D; [<small>EARS</small>] <small>OF THE LORD</small>. (Numb. 21:5:) <small>SO THE PEOPLE SPOKE AGAINST GOD AND AGAINST MOSES</small>.

(Numb. 14:1:) <small>AND THAT NIGHT THE PEOPLE WEPT</small>. (Exod. 32:1:) <small>THE PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER AGAINST AARON</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:1): <small>THE PEOPLE BEGAN&#x2026;.</small> Throw a stick into the air,<sup><xref rid="fn985">113</xref></sup> &#x003C;and&#x003E; it falls to its place of origin (i.e., the ground).<sup><xref rid="fn986">114</xref></sup> The one who had begun with the whoredom at first, reconciled himself to it in the end. Their matriarchs (i.e., the matriarchs of Ammon and Moab) began with whoredom (according to Gen. 19:33&#x2013;34): <small>AND THE FIRST-BORN CAME AND SLEPT WITH HER FATHER&#x2026;. &#x003C;SO IT CAME TO PASS ON THE NEXT DAY&#x003E; THAT THE FIRST-BORN SAID UNTO THE YOUNGER: &#x003C;SEE, LAST NIGHT I SLEPT WITH MY FATHER&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> She (the first-born) had instructed her in whoredom, and for that reason the Holy One had pity on the younger and did not expose her. Rather (according to vs. 35): <small>AND SHE SLEPT WITH HIM</small>; but with reference to the elder, it is written (in vs. 33): <small>AND SLEPT WITH HER FATHER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn987">115</xref></sup> In the case of the one who began in whoredom at first, her daughters (i.e., the daughters of Moab) were the first to reconcile themselves to whoredom. (Numb. 25:1:) <small>&#x003C;WHILE ISRAEL WAS STAYING AT SHITTIM,&#x003E; THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO GO WHORING UNTO THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB</small>.</p>
<title>7.27 Numbers 25:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:2:) <small>AND THEY INVITED THE PEOPLE TO THE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR GODS</small>. Thus they (i.e., daughters of Moab) were going by the counsel of Balaam, as stated (in Numb. 31:16): <small>HERE THESE WOMEN &#x003C;AT THE BIDDING OF BALAAM&#x003E; MADE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x2026;</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn988">116</xref></sup> They made themselves curtained stalls and installed harlots in them with every object of delight in their hands. Now a girl would have an old woman as an agent, for an old woman would be in front of the shop. During the time that Israel was passing by on the way to the market place, the woman would say to him: Surely you want objects of linen which have come from Beth-shean&#x0021; Then she would show them to him; and when the old woman would tell him a high price, the girl would &#x003C;give him&#x003E; a lower one. From then on the girl would tell him: You are like one of the family. Sit down. Now a jug of Ammonite wine was placed by her, since the wine of star worshipers had not yet been forbidden. Then out comes a girl, perfumed and adorned, who seduces him and says to him: Why do you hate us, when we love you. Take for yourself this article gratis. We all are children of a single man, children of Terah, the father of Abraham. So do you not want to eat from our sacrifices and from our cooking? Here are calves and cocks for you which we have slaughtered according to your own precepts. So eat. Immediately she has him drink the wine. Then Satan (<italic><small>STN</small></italic>) burned within him, so that he fell madly in love (<italic><small>S</small>h<small>TH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn989">117</xref></sup> with her.</p>
<p>There are also those who say: Balaam commanded them not to have them drink the wine, so that they would not be judged as those who are drunk but as willful sinners. When he sought her out, she would say: I am not listening to you until you slaughter &#x003C;a sacrifice&#x003E; to Peor. Since he had fallen madly in love with her, he would slaughter a cock to Peor and eat it with her. So they would be joined to each other. It is therefore written (in Numb. 25:2): <small>AND THEY INVITED THE PEOPLE &#x003C;TO THE SACRIFICES FOR THEIR GODS, SO THAT THE PEOPLE ATE AND BOWED DOWN TO THEIR GODS&#x003E;</small>. Thus Israel was joined (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></italic>) to Baal Peor like bracelets (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></italic>). R. Levi said: This was more serious than the &#x003C;sin of the golden&#x003E; calf, [for while in reference to the calf it is written (in Exod. 32:3): <small>SO ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK OFF &#x003C;THE GOLD RINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR EARS &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>, so here (in Numb. 25:3): <small>THUS ISRAEL WAS JOINED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></italic>) <small>&#x003C;TO BAAL PEOR</small>,&#x003E; like bracelets (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s<small>MD</small></italic>)&#x003E;. Because of the calf about three thousand fell, but here (according to Numb. 25:9) &#x003C;the number fallen is&#x003E; twenty-four thousand.</p>
<title>7.28 Numbers 25:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:4:) <small>TAKE ALL THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE, AND IMPALE THEM &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD IN THE SUN&#x003E;</small>. R. Judan said: He hanged the heads of the people, because they had not protested about the people who stood out among them like the Sun.<sup><xref rid="fn990">118</xref></sup> R. Nehemiah said: He did not hang them. Rather the Holy One said to Moses: Appoint Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn991">119</xref></sup> heads for them, and let them judge whoever went to Peor. He said to him: But who will make such a one<sup><xref rid="fn992">120</xref></sup> known? The Holy One said to him: I will expose such a one. In the case of whoever has gone astray, the cloud shall be peeled back from upon him, and the sun shall shine upon him in the midst of the congregation. Then they will know anyone who has gone astray and hang him. You know for yourself that it is so. (Numb. 25:5:) <small>SO MOSES SAID UNTO THE JUDGES OF ISRAEL: EACH OF YOU KILL &#x003C;THOSE OF&#x003E; HIS OWN PEOPLE &#x003C;WHO HAVE BEEN JOINED TO BAAL PEOR&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>7.29 Numbers 25:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:6:) <small>JUST THEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL CAME AND BROUGHT A MIDIANITE WOMAN UNTO HIS FAMILY &#x003C; BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. What reason was there for him doing so?<sup><xref rid="fn993">121</xref></sup> &#x003C;The incident serves&#x003E; to teach you that he had respect neither for heaven nor for mortals. It is also stated concerning him (in Prov. 21:24): <small>AN INSOLENT</small><sup><xref rid="fn994">122</xref></sup> <small>AND ARROGANT ONE, SCORNER IS HIS NAME; HE ACTS WITH ARROGANT WANTONNESS</small>. Because &#x003C;the woman&#x003E; was a king&#x2019;s daughter, she said to him: I am surrendering to no one but Moses or Eleazar. He said to her: I also am as great as they are, in that I bring you before their eyes. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; he seized her by her braid and brought her to Moses. He said to him: Son of Amram, is this woman permitted or forbidden? Now if you say that she is forbidden, &#x003C;because&#x003E; this woman is a Midianite, &#x003C;remember that&#x003E; the very woman who is under you (as your wife) is a Midianite; and who permitted you to have her? The ruling (<italic>halakhah</italic>) slipped from his mind. They all wept bitterly. That is what is written (in Numb. 25:6): <small>&#x003C;BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003E; AS THEY WERE WEEPING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TENT OF MEETING</small>. Why were they weeping? Because they were discouraged for the time being. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king&#x2019;s daughter who had adorned herself for entering the wedding canopy &#x003C;and&#x003E; for sitting in the &#x003C;bridal&#x003E; palanquin.<sup><xref rid="fn995">123</xref></sup> When she was found indulging in immorality with another, her beloved and her kinsfolk became discouraged. So it was with Israel. At the end of forty years they had camped by the Jordan to cross into the land of Israel, and there they became lawless through whoredom. They made Moses discouraged and the righteous who were with him. But why did the ruling (<italic>halakhah</italic>) slip from his mind? It was simply so that Phinehas would come and receive his due. Moreover, because &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; had been indolent (in the execution of justice), (according to Deut. 34:6) <small>NO ONE KNOWS HIS BURIAL PLACE</small>. &#x003C;This fact serves&#x003E; to teach you that one must be as strong as a leopard and as swift as an eagle to do the will of his Creator that &#x003C;dwells&#x003E; in the heavens. Moreover, from here you learn that the Holy One is as meticulous with the righteous as a thread of hair.</p>
<title>7.30 Numbers 25:1ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:7&#x2013;8:) <small>WHEN PHINEHAS &#x003C;BEN ELEAZAR BEN AARON THE PRIEST&#x003E; SAW THIS, &#x003C;HE AROSE FROM THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION AND TOOK A SPEAR IN HIS HAND. THEN HE WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE TENT, AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM, THE MAN OF ISRAEL AND THE WOMAN THROUGH HER BELLY&#x003E;</small>. But did they all not see it?<sup><xref rid="fn996">124</xref></sup> &#x007B;And was it not before the eyes of all Israel and the eyes of Moses?&#x007D; [And is it not written (in vs. 6) <small>BEFORE THE EYES OF MOSES AND THE EYES OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL?</small>] It is simply that when he saw the deed, he remembered the ruling (<italic>halakhah</italic>), that one who cohabits with an Aramean woman will have zealots strike him down.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:7:) <small>HE AROSE FROM THE MIDST OF THE CONGREGATION</small>. From where did he stand up? It is simply that, while they were involved in give and take on the matter of whether or not &#x003C;the culprit&#x003E; was liable to death, that man (Phinehas) stood up from the midst of the congregation and volunteered &#x003C;to carry out the sentence &#x003E;.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:7, cont.:) <small>AND TOOK A SPEAR IN HIS HAND</small>. He put the iron prongs in his hand, which he put in his bosom. Then he began &#x003C;to approach&#x003E; leaning on the wood like a staff,<sup><xref rid="fn997">125</xref></sup> because he was afraid of &#x003C;the culprit&#x2019;s&#x003E; tribe as they surrounded him. When he reached them, they said to him: Why have you come? He said to them: I also have come to fulfill my needs. So they gave him permission, and he entered, for otherwise they would not have given him permission.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:8:) <small>THEN HE WENT AFTER THE MAN OF ISRAEL INTO THE TENT, AND PIERCED BOTH OF THEM</small>. He pierced both of them, the one on top of the other, through the unclean place (i.e., the private parts) of the both of them, lest Israel say there was no defilement there. Come and see how many miracles happened there&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn998">126</xref></sup> (1) He put power in his arm for lifting them up and (2) power in the shaft to stay in them. (3) The opening (of the tent) was raised so that both of them might come out raised up (on the spear). (4) When they came out, the members of his tribe were ready to strike him down, but an angel arose and smote those before him. (5) When Phinehas saw that &#x003C;an angel had arisen&#x003E; to destroy them, he struck them on the ground. (6) Then when he had arisen and prayed, he removed them. That is what is written (in Ps. 106:30): <small>THEN PHINEHAS AROSE AND INTERCEDED</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn999">127</xref></sup> in that he gave the judicial verdict (<italic>din</italic>). <small>INTERCEDED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PLL</small></italic>) can only denote a judicial verdict (<italic>din</italic>), since it is stated (in reference to making a reparation Exod. 21:22): <small>AND HE SHALL PAY AS THE JUDGES</small> (rt.: <italic><small>PLL</small></italic>) <small>DETERMINE</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:9:) <small>AND THOSE WHO DIED FROM THE PLAGUE WERE TWENTY-FOUR THOUSANDS&#x003E;.</small> &#x003C;These words serve&#x003E; to inform you that, on every occasion when they fell, they were numbered. The Holy One has said: In this world it is on account of gross misconduct that they fall, but in the world to come (according to Hos. 2:1 [1:10]): <small>THE NUMBER OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SHALL BE AS THE SAND OF THE SEA, WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED OR NUMBERED&#x2026;</small>.</p>

In a long note Buber further explains that apart from the law of mixtures, in the removal of the <italic>hallah,</italic> what is taken is generally 1/24 of the dough (so <italic>Hal</italic>. 2:7). Buber also notes a variant reading which substitutes <italic>menabber</italic> (denoting one who removes the hallah) for <italic>menakkah</italic> (translated here as &#x201C;discount&#x201D;). So the Holy One cleansed Israel by removing 1/24 of the people. However, since there were 600,000 Israelites, 25,000 (&#x003D;1/24 of 600,000), not 24,000, should have been removed. The thousand extra can be explained on analogy with the law of mixtures allowing 1/24 for impurities. The first part of the interpretation in the text comes from dividing 25,000 into two parts of 20,000 &#x002B; 5,000 and then multiplying each separately and adding the results, instead of simply multiplying 25,000 by 24,000. Regarding the number of Israelites in the desert, Scripture gives the 600,000 figure only in Exod. 12:37. Cf. Exod. 38:26; Numb. 1:46; 2:32, which fix the figure at 603,550 adult males excluding Levites; also Numb. 26:57, which reports a census figure of 601,730 after the removal of the 24,000 in Numb. 25:9.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn952">80. In most translations the word is understood to mean &#x201C;wild ox,&#x201D; but the midrash regards it as a derived from the root <italic>RWM</italic>, a verb meaning &#x201C;to be high.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>8.1 Numbers 25:10ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:10&#x2013;11:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: PHINEHAS BEN ELEAZAR &#x003C;BEN AARON THE PRIEST HAS TURNED AROUND MY WRATH FROM UPON THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> Let our master instruct us: What blessing does one say on seeing a human being that is different?<sup><xref rid="fn1000">1</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: On seeing a black person, one with red blotches, one with white blotches,<sup><xref rid="fn1001">2</xref></sup> a hunchback, a pockmarked person, a dwarf,<sup><xref rid="fn1002">3</xref></sup> or one afflicted with dropsy<sup><xref rid="fn1003">4</xref></sup>, one says: Blessed is the one who makes mortals different. On seeing [an amputee,] someone blind, or someone smitten with boils, one says: Blessed is one who makes mortals different; &#x003C;he is&#x003E; the true judge.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">5</xref></sup> When &#x003C;should one recite it&#x003E;? When they who were &#x003C;once&#x003E; whole have become different. But if they were like that from their mother&#x2019;s womb, one says: Blessed is the one who makes mortals different. On seeing good creatures and good trees, one says: Blessed are you O Lord our God, King of the World, who has created such things in his world;<sup><xref rid="fn1005">6</xref></sup> but if he sees crowds<sup><xref rid="fn1006">7</xref></sup> of human beings, he says: Blessed is the one who is learned in mysteries.<sup><xref rid="fn1007">8</xref></sup> Just as their faces<sup><xref rid="fn1008">9</xref></sup> are unlike each other, so are they unlike in temperament. Rather each and every individual has his own individual temperament; and so it says (in Job 28:25): <small>TO FIX A WEIGHT FOR THE SPIRIT</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1009">10</xref></sup> &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; the &#x003C;spiritual&#x003E; weight of each and every individual. You yourself know that it is so, because of what Moses asked from the Holy One at the time of his death, when he said to him: Sovereign of the World, the temperament of each and every person is revealed to you; and the temperament of one person is unlike the temperament of another. Now that I am departing from them, would you please, if you so desire, appoint a leader over them. Appoint over them a person who will bear with each and every one of them according to his temperament. Where is it shown? From what they have read on the matter (in Numb. 27:16): <small>LET THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH, APPOINT &#x003C;SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION &#x003E;&#x2026;.</small></p>
<title>8.2 Numbers 25:10ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 27:16:) <small>LET THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS &#x003C;OF ALL FLESH&#x003E;, APPOINT &#x003C;SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION&#x003E;</small>.] This text is related (to Is. 45:11): <small>REGARDING THE THINGS TO COME, WOULD YOU QUESTION ME CONCERNING MY CHILDREN AND COMMAND THE WORK OF MY HANDS?</small><sup><xref rid="fn1010">11</xref></sup> A parable: To what is the matter comparable?<sup><xref rid="fn1011">12</xref></sup> To a king who took a wife and had a best man (<italic>shoshevin</italic>). Every time that the king was angry with his wife, the best man would placate<sup><xref rid="fn1012">13</xref></sup> him and the king would be reconciled. When the best man was about to die, he began to make a request of the king. He said to him: would you please pay attention to your wife. The king said to him: Instead of you charging me concerning my wife, charge my wife concerning me, that she be careful about my honor. So did the Holy One, as it were, say to Moses: Instead of you charging me (in Numb. 27:16): <small>LET THE GOD OF THE SPIRITS OF ALL FLESH &#x003C;APPOINT SOMEONE OVER THE CONGREGATION&#x003E;</small>, charge them concerning me, that they be diligent about my honor. What is written below (in Numb. 28:1&#x2013;2)? <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>8.3 Numbers 25:10ff, Part III</title>
<p>Let us go back to the beginning of the section (i.e., to Numb. 25:10&#x2013;11). What reason did the Holy One have for tracing the lineage of Phinehas after this act (of slaying Zimri in Numb. 25:8)?<sup><xref rid="fn1013">14</xref></sup> &#x003C;The reason was&#x003E; that, when Zimri ben Salu was pierced along with Cozbi bat Zur, the tribes rose up against him and said: Did you see ben Puti? This man, whose mother&#x2019;s father<sup><xref rid="fn1014">15</xref></sup> fattened calves for star worship, has killed a tribal prince of Israel&#x0021; Therefore Scripture has come to trace his lineage &#x003C;through his paternal grandfather&#x003E; (in Numb. 25:11): <small>PHINEHAS BEN ELIEZER, BEN AARON THE PRIEST</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:12:) <small>SAY, THEREFORE: I HEREBY GRANT MY COVENANT OF PEACE</small>. And so it says (in Mal. 2:5:) <small>MY COVENANT WAS WITH HIM. &#x003C;A COVENANT OF&#x003E; LIFE AND PEACE</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:13:) <small>AND IT SHALL BELONG TO HIM AND TO HIS SEED AFTER HIM</small> [&#x2026;], <small>&#x003C;BECAUSE HE WAS ZEALOUS FOR HIS GOD&#x003E; AND ATONED FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. Since atonement is spoken of in connection with him, did he offer a sacrifice? &#x003C;The mention of atonement is&#x003E; simply to teach you that, when anyone sheds the blood of the wicked, it is as if he had offered a sacrifice.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:14:) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE SLAIN MAN OF ISRAEL</small>. Just as the Holy One is concerned with the praise of the righteous to publicize<sup><xref rid="fn1015">16</xref></sup> them throughout the world, so is he concerned with disgrace of the wicked to publicize them throughout the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">17</xref></sup> Phinehas was due praise. About him is stated (in Prov. 10:7): <small>THE REMEMBRANCE OF A RIGHTEOUS ONE IS FOR A BLESSING</small>. Zimri was due disrepute. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BUT THE NAME OF THE WICKED SHALL ROT</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:14, cont.:) <small>ZIMRI BEN SALU, &#x003C;PRINCE OF A CLAN BELONGING TO THE SIMEONITES&#x003E;</small>. Whoever discredits himself discredits his family along with himself. It is astounding what is written about him (in Eccl. 10:8): <small>THE ONE WHO BREAKS THROUGH &#x003C;A BARRIER&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn1017">18</xref></sup> is a son (i.e., Zimri). His ancestor (Simeon) was the barrier maker. He was the first to display zeal against harlotry, as stated (in Gen. 34:25): <small>THEN TWO OF THE SONS OF JACOB, SIMEON AND LEVI, &#x003C;THE BROTHERS OF DINAH, EACH&#x003E; TOOK &#x003C;HIS SWORD&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> But this &#x003C;Zimri&#x003E; broke through the barrier which his ancestor had made.</p>
<p>(Numb. 25:15:) <small>AND THE NAME OF THE MIDIANITE WOMAN WHO WAS SLAIN &#x003C;WAS COZBI BAT ZUR; ZUR WAS THE TRIBAL HEAD OF A CLAN IN MIDIAN&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;These words are there&#x003E; to inform you how far the Midianites had given themselves &#x003C;over to idolatry&#x003E;. Thus they had abandoned a daughter of kings in prostitution. (Numb. 31:8:) <small>&#x003C;AND ALONG WITH THEIR OTHER VICTIMS&#x003E; THEY KILLED THE KINGS OF MIDIAN:</small> [<small>&#x003C;EVI, REKEM,&#x003E; ZUR, &#x003C;HUR, AND REBA, THE FIVE KINGS OF MIDIAN, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small>] Zur was the greatest of them all; but because he had abandoned his daughter and exposed<sup><xref rid="fn1018">19</xref></sup> her, the text has demoted him and numbered him third (in the list). [He was, however, the greatest king of them all, as stated (in Numb. 25:15): <small>&#x003C;ZUR&#x003E; WAS THE TRIBAL HEAD OF A CLAN IN MIDIAN</small>.</p>
<title>8.4 Numbers 25:10ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:16&#x2013;17:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>. Why?<sup><xref rid="fn1019">20</xref></sup> (Numb. 25:18:) <small>BECAUSE THEY ARE HARASSING YOU</small>. Hence the sages have said: If someone comes to kill you, act first to kill him.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">21</xref></sup> [R. Simeon says:] Whoever causes a person to sin is worse than the one who kills him, because whoever kills &#x003C;a person&#x003E; kills him in this world, but he &#x003C;still&#x003E; has a share in the world to come. However, the one who causes him to sin kills him in this world and for the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">22</xref></sup> Two peoples encountered Israel with the sword: Egyptians and Edomites. Thus it is stated (of the Egyptians, that they said in Exod. 15:9): <small>I WILL PURSUE, I WILL OVERTAKE, I WILL DIVIDE THE SPOIL</small>. (Also in Numb. 20:18:) <small>BUT EDOM SAID UNTO HIM: YOU SHALL NOT PASS THROUGH ME, OR ELSE I WILL COME OUT TO MEET YOU WITH THE SWORD</small>. Moreover, two &#x003C;peoples encountered them&#x003E; with transgression: Moab and the Ammonites. Concerning the ones who encountered them with the sword, it is written (in Deut. 23:8 [7]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT ABHOR AN EDOMITE &#x2026;; YOU SHALL NOT ABHOR AN EGYPTIAN</small>. But concerning the ones who encountered them with transgression (according to Deut. 23:4 [3]): <small>NO AMMONITE OR MOABITE SHALL COME INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>8.5 Numbers 25:10ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:17:) <small>HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>. Even though it is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10): <small>WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE</small> (<italic>shalom</italic>) <small>UNTO IT</small>; however, in regard to these &#x003C;peoples&#x003E; (according to Deut. 23:7:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE</small> (<italic>shalom</italic>) <small>&#x003C;AND BENEFIT&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1022">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 25:17): <small>HARASS</small> (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>RWR</small></italic>) <small>THE MIDIANITES</small>. Even though I have written (in Deut. 20:19): <small>WHEN YOU BESIEGE</small> (rt. <italic><small>T</small>s<small>WR</small></italic>) <small>A CITY</small> a <small>&#x003C;LONG TIME&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;], <small>YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1023">24</xref></sup> in the case of these (i.e., Moab and and the Ammonites) you shall not do so. On the contrary, their trees you shall destroy. And so you find that, when Joram king of Israel, Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom went to fight with Moab, (according to II Kings 3:9) <small>THEY CIRCLED AROUND ON A SEVEN-DAY MARCH, SO THAT THERE WAS NO WATER FOR THE ARMY OR FOR THE ANIMALS THAT WERE WITH THEM</small>. They began to weep, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 10) <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL SAID: ALAS, FOR THE LORD HAS SUMMONED &#x003C;THESE&#x003E; THREE KINGS &#x003C;TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB&#x003E;</small>. Jehoshaphat answered (in vs. 11): <small>IS THERE NO PROPHET OF THE LORD HERE &#x2026;? &#x003C;THEN ONE OF THE SERVANTS OF THE KING OF ISRAEL ANSWERED&#x003E; AND SAID: ELISHA BEN SHAPHAT WHO USED TO POUR WATER ON THE HANDS OF ELIJAH IS HERE</small>. &#x003C;This passage is&#x003E; to make known the wickedness of Joram, in that he did not acknowledge him. (Vs. 12:) <small>THEN JEHOSHAPHAT SAID: THE WORD OF THE LORD IS WITH HIM. SO THE KING OF ISRAEL, JEHOSHAPHAT, AND THE KING OF EDOM WENT DOWN UNTO HIM</small>. Why is Jehoshaphat not called a king here? In order to make known the humility of that righteous man, in that he did not want to go down before the prophet in royal garb but as a commoner.<sup><xref rid="fn1024">25</xref></sup> Some also say: It was because an edict had been decreed that he would be killed with Ahab, that the scriptural text has reckoned &#x003C;the reign of&#x003E; his son from that hour. For that reason &#x201C;king&#x201D; was not written, but as a reward for their going down to the prophet, they attained the right to see all those miracles. (vs. 13:) [<small>THEN</small>] <small>ELISHA SAID</small> (<small>TO</small>) [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THE KING OF ISRAEL: WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOU</small>? <small>GO UNTO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR FATHER &#x003C;AND UNTO THE PROPHETS OF YOUR MOTHER&#x003E;</small>. He began to implore him. He said to him (ibid., cont.): <small>SURELY THE LORD HAS SUMMONED &#x003C;THESE THREE KINGS TO GIVE THEM INTO THE HAND OF MOAB&#x003E;</small>. (vss. 14&#x2013;17:) [<small>ELISHA</small>] <small>SAID: AS THE LORD OF HOSTS LIVES, BEFORE WHOM I STAND, WERE IT NOT THAT I HAVE REGARD FOR JEHOSHAPHAT</small> [<small>KING OF JUDAH</small>], <small>&#x003C;I WOULD NEITHER LOOK UPON YOU NOR NOTICE YOU&#x003E;. NOW THEN GET ME A MUSICIAN&#x2026;. FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU SHALL SEE NO WIND, NOR SHALL YOU SEE RAIN; YET THAT WADI SHALL BE FILLED WITH WATER&#x2026;.</small> &#x003C;So he gave them&#x003E; what they needed. Moreover, he said to them (in vs. 18&#x2013;19): &#x007B;<small>THE MOABITES SHALL FALL AT YOUR HAND</small>&#x007D; [<small>SO HE WILL GIVE MOAB INTO YOUR HAND</small>]. <small>THUS YOU SHALL SMITE EVERY FORTIFIED CITY AND EVERY CHOICE CITY. YOU SHALL ALSO FELL EVERY GOOD TREE AND STOP UP ALL SPRINGS OF WATER</small>. They said to him: But it is written here (in Deut. 20:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT DESTROY ITS TREES</small>; yet you are saying &#x003C;to do&#x003E; so. He said to them: He gave the command with reference to the rest of the nations, but this one is insignificant, while that one is contemptable, as stated (in II Kings 3:18): <small>THIS ONE IS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD, SO HE WILL GIVE MOAB INTO YOUR HAND</small>. It is also written (in Deut. 23:7 [6]): <small>YOU SHALL NOT SEEK THEIR WELFARE</small> (<italic>shalom</italic>) <small>AND BENEFIT</small>. These are the good trees. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:17): <small>HARASS THE MIDIANITES</small>.</p>
<title>8.6 Numbers 25:10ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Numb. 25:19&#x2013;26:2 [26:1&#x2013;2]:) <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE PLAGUE &#x003C;THAT THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES AND UNTO ELEAZAR BEN AARON THE PRIEST, SAYING:&#x003E; TAKE A CENSUS</small>. Every time that they fell, they were required to be numbered.<sup><xref rid="fn1025">26</xref></sup> &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to the wolf who went into the midst of the flock. The owner of the flock was obliged to count them to know how many were missing.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 26:2): Why did he count them? &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a shepherd to whom the householder has delivered a flock after numbering &#x003C;the sheep&#x003E;. &#x003C;After&#x003E; he has fulfilled his guardianship, when he returns them, it is necessary for them to be numbered. Thus when Israel went out from Egypt &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; delivered them to Moses after numbering &#x003C;them&#x003E;, as stated (in Numb. 1:1&#x2013;2): <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES IN THE SINAI DESERT &#x2026;: TAKE A CENSUS&#x2026;.</small> So also, when they went out, it is written (in Exod. 12:37): <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TRAVELED FROM RAMASES TO SUCCOTH, ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN ON FOOT</small>. Ergo, he received them with a numbering. &#x003C;When&#x003E; he was about to pass away in the plains of Moab (after completing his guardianship), he returned them with a numbering.</p>
<title>8.7 Numbers 27:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 27:1:) <small>THEN CAME FORWARD THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD</small>. In that generation the women were fencing in &#x003C;the Law&#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn1026">27</xref></sup> which the men were breaking down.<sup><xref rid="fn1027">28</xref></sup> Accordingly you find that Aaron said to them (i.e., the men in Exod. 32:2): <small>TAKE OFF THE GOLD RINGS &#x003C;THAT ARE IN THE EARS OF YOUR WIVES &#x2026; &#x003E;</small>; but the women were unwilling and tried to stop their husbands. Thus it is stated (in vs. 3): <small>SO ALL THE PEOPLE TOOK OFF THE GOLD RINGS THAT WERE IN THEIR</small><sup><xref rid="fn1028">29</xref></sup> <small>EARS</small>. Thus the women did not take part in making the &#x003C;golden&#x003E; calf. So also in the case of the spies who had spread slander (according to Numb. 14:36): <small>WHEN THEY RETURNED, THEY MADE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION MURMUR AGAINST HIM</small>. A decree was issued against them, because they had said (in Numb. 13:31): <small>WE ARE UNABLE TO GO UP &#x003C;AGAINST THIS PEOPLE FOR THEY ARE STRONGER THAN WE&#x003E;</small>. The women, however, were not with them in their counsel. What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 26:65)? <small>BECAUSE THE LORD HAD SAID TO THEM: THEY SHALL SURELY DIE IN THE WILDERNESS, NOT A MAN OF THEM REMAINED</small>. &#x003C;Note that Scripture speaks of&#x003E; [<small>A MAN</small>] and not of &#x201C;a woman.&#x201D; Why? Because they (i.e., the men) did not want to enter the land, but the women came forward to ask for an inheritance in the land. Therefore the parashah (which contains Numb. 26:65) was written next to this parashah, because what the men broke down the women fenced in.</p>
<title>8.8 Numbers 27:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:1): <small>THEN CAME FORWARD &#x003C;THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD BEN HEPHER BEN GILEAD BEN MACHIR BEN MANASSEH, OF THE FAMILIES OF MANASSEH BEN JOSEPH</small>. Their action was&#x003E; an honor to them. &#x003C;It was also&#x003E; an honor to their father, an honor to Machir, and an honor to Joseph that such righteous and wise women had issued from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1029">30</xref></sup> But what was their wisdom? They spoke up at the proper time, when Moses was busy with the parashah on inheritance (in accordance with Numb. 26:53): <small>TO THESE SHALL THE LAND BE APPORTIONED &#x003C;FOR AN INHERITANCE&#x003E;</small>. They said to him: If we are like a son, let us inherit; but if not, let our mother marry her husband&#x2019;s brother.<sup><xref rid="fn1030">31</xref></sup> Immediately (in Numb. 27:5): <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. They were righteous, in that they had not been married.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">32</xref></sup> Then why did they meet with Moses? So that he would not put on airs over having abstained from his wife for forty years.<sup><xref rid="fn1032">33</xref></sup> The Holy One informed him through these women, saying: Here are women who without being commanded remained &#x003C;unmarried&#x003E; for forty years until they were married to someone worthy of them.</p>
<title>8.9 Numbers 27:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 27:5:) <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This happened&#x003E; according to what Moses said (in Deut. 1:17): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU &#x003C;YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">34</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; the daughters of Zelophehad came for a judgment, the Holy One said: Did you not say (ibid.): <small>BUT THE CASE WHICH IS TOO HARD FOR YOU YOU SHALL BRING UNTO ME?</small> In the case of the judgment which you do not know, see, the women have decided it.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:5:) <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. R. Simeon ben Laqish said: Our Master Moses knew this judgment, but they first came before chiefs of tens.<sup><xref rid="fn1034">35</xref></sup> They said to them: It is a judgment concerning inheritance, and this is not for us but for those greater than we. They came before the chiefs of fifties. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they saw that the chiefs of ten had shown them honor, the chiefs of fifty said: [In our case] also there are &#x007B;there&#x007D; those greater than we. So also &#x003C;they came before&#x003E; the chiefs of hundreds, the chiefs of thousands, and the princes. They all responded to them in a similar way, because they did not want to open their mouths before one who was greater than they. Moses said: If I tell them the decision, I shall be appropriating all their dignity. He said to them: In my case also there is one greater than I. Therefore (in Numb. 27:5): <small>MOSES BROUGHT THEIR CAUSE &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. He answered him with a yes (in vs. 7): <small>THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT</small>. Thus the Holy One acknowledged their utterance.</p>
<p>(Numb. 27:7, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM &#x003C;POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER&#x003E;</small>. Give them chattels and their father&#x2019;s birthright in the assets of Hepher. They took three portions: the portion of their father, who was among those who had come out from Egypt; his portion with his brothers in the assets of Hepher; and since he was the first born, he took two portions.</p>
<title>8.10 Numbers 27:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 27:7): <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM &#x003C;POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER&#x003E;</small>. When they received &#x003C;their share&#x003E; on the other side of the Jordan, they came before Joshua and Eleazar in the land of Canaan, as stated (in Josh. 17:4): <small>NOW THEY</small> (i.e., the daughters of Zelophehad) <small>CAME BEFORE ELEAZAR THE PRIEST, JOSHUA BEN NUN, AND THE PRINCES &#x003C;AND SAID: THE LORD COMMANDED MOSES TO GIVE US AN INHERITANCE ALONG WITH OUR MALE KIN&#x003E;</small>. Moreover, our ancestor Jacob also knew that they were receiving &#x003C;an inheritance&#x003E; on this side &#x003C;of the Jordan&#x003E; as well as on that side, since it is stated (in Gen. 49:22): <small>DAUGHTERS</small><sup><xref rid="fn1035">36</xref></sup> <small>STEP OVER A WALL</small>. This &#x003C;wall&#x003E; is the Jordan, which became a wall for Moses so that he would not enter the land. Thus [Jacob] said to [Joseph]: Your daughters shall receive a share on this side &#x003C;of the Jordan&#x003E; as well as on that side.</p>
<p>(Numb. 27:7:) <small>&#x003C;THE DAUGHTERS OF ZELOPHEHAD SPEAK WHAT IS RIGHT. YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM POSSESSION OF AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE BROTHERS OF THEIR FATHER, &#x003E; AND YOU SHALL TRANSFER TO THEM THE INHERITANCE OF THEIR FATHER</small>. With reference to &#x003C;normal&#x003E; inheritance it is stated (in vs. 9): <small>AND YOU SHALL GIVE &#x003C;HIS INHERITANCE TO HIS BROTHERS&#x003E;</small>, but with reference to a daughter &#x003C;it says&#x003E; (in vs. 8): <small>AND YOU SHALL TRANSFER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1036">37</xref></sup> Thus she may <small>TRANSFER</small> an inheritance from tribe to tribe.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 27:11:) <small>AND IT SHALL BE A STATUTARY JUDGMENT FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. &#x003C;The word <small>JUDGMENT&#x003E;</small> teachs that inheritances &#x003C;can only&#x003E; be carried out through judges.</p>
<p>(Numb. 27:12:) <small>THEN THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>SPOKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>SAID</small>] <small>UNTO MOSES, SAYING: GO UP ON THIS MOUNTAIN OF ABARIM&#x2026;</small>. What reason did he have &#x003C;for it&#x003E; to be written after the parashah on inheritance?<sup><xref rid="fn1038">39</xref></sup> It was simply that when Moses heard from the mouth of the Holy One (in Numb. 27:7): <small>YOU SHALL INDEED GRANT THEM</small>, he thought that the Holy One had been reconciled to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1039">40</xref></sup> He said: Here I am allotting inheritances for Israel. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; the Holy One said to him: My decree remains in place. (Numb. 27:12&#x2013;13:) <small>GO UP INTO THE MOUNTAIN OF ABARIM &#x003C;AND SEE THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN IT, YOU ALSO SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR PEOPLE, JUST AS YOUR BROTHER AARON WAS SO GATHERED&#x003E;</small>. You are no better than your brother.</p>
<title>8.11 Numbers 28:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 28:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, AND SAY UNTO THEM: MY OFFERING, MY BREAD FOR MY FIRE OFFERING, &#x003C;MY SWEET AROMA, YOU SHALL TAKE HEED TO OFFER ME IN ITS DUE SEASON&#x003E;</small>. Let our master instruct us: Regarding the meal offerings that were offered upon the altar, how were they offered?<sup><xref rid="fn1040">41</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Men</italic>. 5:1&#x2013;2):<sup><xref rid="fn1041">42</xref></sup> <small>ALL MEAL OFFERINGS WERE OFFERED UNLEAVENED EXCEPT THE LEAVENED &#x003C;CAKES&#x003E; IN THE THANK OFFERING AND THE TWO LOAVES</small> (of Pentecost) <small>WHICH WERE OFFERED LEAVENED. R. MEIR SAYS: THE LEAVEN IS SEPARATED FROM THEIR OWN &#x003C;DOUGH&#x003E;, AND &#x003C;IT IS FROM THIS THAT&#x003E; THEY ARE LEAVENED. R. JUDAH SAYS: EVEN THAT IS NOT THE BEST &#x003C;METHOD&#x003E;; ONE SHOULD BRING THE LEAVEN, PUT IT INTO THE MEASURE, AND FILL THE MEASURE &#x003C;WITH THE FLOUR&#x003E;. &#x003C;THE SAGES&#x003E; SAID TO HIM: EVEN THAT &#x003C;METHOD&#x003E; RESULTED TOO LITTLE OR TOO MUCH. ALL MEAL OFFERINGS WERE KNEADED IN LUKEWARM WATER AND ONE WATCHED THEM LEST THEY BECOME LEAVENED; AND IF THE REST OF IT BECAME LEAVENED, ONE TRANSGRESSED A NEGATIVE COMMANDMENT, AS STATED</small> (in Lev. 2:11): <small>NO MEAL OFFERING WHICH YOU OFFER TO THE LORD SHALL BE MADE WITH LEAVEN. THUS ONE MAY BECOME CULPABLE IN THE KNEADING OF &#x003C;LEAVEN&#x003E;, IN ROLLING IT, AND IN BAKING IT</small>. Of all the offerings none is more pleasing to you than the thank offering. The Holy One said to Moses: Say to those Israelites: I did not tell you to offer me sacrifices because I have need of them, since the whole world is mine.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">43</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Ps. 50:12): <small>IF I AM HUNGRY, I WOULD NOT TELL YOU, FOR THE WORLD AND EVERYTHING IN IT BELONG TO ME</small>.</p>
<title>8.12 Numbers 28:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 28:3:) <small>AND YOU SHALL SAY TO THEM: THIS IS THE BURNT OFFERING &#x003C;WHICH YOU SHALL OFFER TO THE LORD: TWO YEARLING LAMBS WITHOUT BLEMISH&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Not two simultaneously, but (as in vs. 4): <small>THE ONE LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER IN THE MORNING, AND THE SECOND LAMB YOU SHALL OFFER AT TWILIGHT</small>. R. Judah bar Simon said: None who ever lodged in Jerusalem had sin on their hands.<sup><xref rid="fn1043">44</xref></sup> How so? The sacrifice of the morning atoned for the transgressions which were committed during the night, and the daily sacrifice at twilight atoned for transgressions which were committed during the day. In any case none who lodged in Jerusalem had sin on their hands, as stated (in Is. 1:21): <small>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS LODGES</small><sup><xref rid="fn1044">45</xref></sup> <small>THERE</small> (i.e., in Jerusalem). The Holy One said to those Israelites: In this world you offer shewbread and sacrifices, but in the world to come I will prepare a great table for you with the nations of the world looking on in shame. It is so stated (in Ps. 23:5): <small>YOU PREPARE A TABLE BEFORE ME IN THE PRESENCE OF MY ENEMIES; YOU ANOINT MY HEAD WITH OIL; MY CUP OVERFLOWS</small>. It also says (in Is. 65:13 (with reference to those who forsake the <small>LORD</small>): <small>BEHOLD, MY SERVANTS SHALL EAT, BUT YOU SHALL GO HUNGRY&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>8.13 Numbers 29:35ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY &#x003C;YOU SHALL HAVE&#x003E; A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY&#x2026;</small>. Let our master instruct us: Is it permitted to eat outside the Sukkah on the the feast (of Tabernacles)?<sup><xref rid="fn1045">46</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Suk.</italic> 2:6): [<small>R. ELIEZER SAYS</small>:] <small>ONE IS DUTY BOUND TO EAT FOURTEEN TIMES IN THE SUKKAH, ONE &#x003C;EACH&#x003E; DAY AND ONE &#x003C;EACH&#x003E; NIGHT; BUT THE SAGES SAY: THERE IS NO PRESCRIBED NUMBER EXCEPT</small> [<small>ONLY</small>] <small>ON THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST FESTAL DAY</small> [<small>OF THE FEAST</small>]. But why did the sages permit one to be freed from the Sukkah on the last festal day? Simply because the whole seven days of the festival they had prayed for abundant dew, while on the last day they prayed for rain. They therefore were freed from the Sukkah, so that they might pray wholeheartedly for rain. Nevertheless the last day of the holiday is reckoned as belonging to the days of the festival. Why? Because is is so written (in Numb. 29:35): <small>&#x003C;ON THE EIGHTH DAY&#x003E; YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small> (<italic>atseret</italic>). Now it was fitting for it to come fifty days after the festival, just as Pentecost (<italic>atseret</italic>) comes fifty days after Passover; but the Holy One said: It is winter and they will not be able to leave their houses to come here &#x003C;to Jerusalem&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1046">47</xref></sup> Let them make the solemn assembly, while they are &#x003C;already here&#x003E; with me. How is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 29:35): <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY &#x003C;YOU SHALL&#x003E; HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>.</p>
<title>8.14 Numbers 29:35ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY&#x2026;.</small>: This text is related (to Ps. 109:4): <small>IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY DENOUNCE ME, BUT I AM A PRAYER</small>. You find that on the festival (of Tabernacles) Israel would offer seventy bulls for the seventy nations.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">48</xref></sup> Therefore, they should love us. It is not enough that they do not love us, but they also hate us, as stated (in Ps. 109:4): <small>IN RETURN FOR MY LOVE THEY DENOUNCE ME</small>. Therefore the Holy One has said to them: For seven days of the festival you have offered sacrifices to me for the nations of the world. Now, however, you are to offer &#x003C;sacrifices&#x003E; for yourselves. (Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>.</p>
<title>8.15 Numbers 29:35ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 29:36:) <small>THEN YOU SHALL OFFER A WHOLE BURNT OFFERING</small>, [<small>A FIRE OFFERING, A SWEET AROMA TO THE LORD</small>]: <small>ONE BULL, ONE RAM, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> &#x003C;The situation&#x003E; is comparble to a king who made a seven-day banquet and invited all the people of the province for the seven days of the feast. When the seven days of the feast had passed, he said to his friend: We have already fulfilled our obligation to the people of the province. Let us, you and me, make do with whatever you find: a pound<sup><xref rid="fn1048">49</xref></sup> of meat, fish, or greens. Similarly did the Holy One say to Israel: All the sacrifices which you offered during the seven days of the feast you sacrificed for the nations of the world. However (according to Numb. 29:35): <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>. Make do with whatever you find (as in Numb. 29:36): <small>ONE BULL, ONE RAM &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small></p>
<title>8.16 Numbers 29:35ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY</small>: What was the reason for &#x003C;the number of sacrificial animals&#x003E; being reduced on each day?<sup><xref rid="fn1049">50</xref></sup> The Torah is simply teaching you ettiquette from the sacrifices. Thus if someone goes for lodging,<sup><xref rid="fn1050">51</xref></sup> where his friend receives him, on the first day that he receives him, he feeds him fowl. Then on the second he feeds him fish; [on the third he feeds him meat;] on the fourth he feeds him greens. So does he continue to reduce, until he is feeding him pulse.</p>
<title>8.17 Numbers 29:35ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 29:35:) <small>ON THE EIGHTH DAY YOU SHALL HAVE</small> (literally: <small>THERE SHALL BE FOR YOU</small>) <small>A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY</small>. What is the meaning of <small>FOR YOU</small>? The Holy One said to Israel: The festive occasion<sup><xref rid="fn1051">52</xref></sup> is fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; New Moons are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; festival times are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>; holidays are fitting <small>FOR YOU</small>. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>FOR YOU</small>. A certain star worshiper questioned R. Aqiva. He said to him: Why do you keep festival times? Did not he say the following to you (in Is. 1:14): <small>YOUR NEW MOONS AND YOUR FESTIVAL TIMES MY SOUL HATES</small>? R. Aqiva said to him: If &#x003C;the Holy One&#x003E; had said: &#x201C;My New Moons and my festival times my soul hates,&#x201D; I should have said so. He only said: <small>YOUR NEW MOONS AND YOUR FESTIVAL TIMES</small>, because these are the festival times which Jeroboam instituted, as stated (in I Kings 12:32): <small>JEROBOAM ALSO INSTITUTED A FESTIVAL&#x2026;.</small> These festival times, however, (the ones ordained by the Holy One) shall never be abolished. Neither shall the New Moons. Why? Because they belong to the Holy One, as stated (in Lev. 23:2): <small>THE FESTIVAL TIMES OF THE LORD</small>. It also says (ibid.): <small>THESE ARE MY FESTIVAL TIMES</small>. [(Also in vs. 4:) <small>THESE ARE THE FESTIVAL TIMES OF THE LORD</small>.] They shall, therefore, never be abolished; for it is concerning them that it is stated (in Ps. 111:8): <small>THEY ARE ESTABLISHED FOREVER TO BE PERFORMED WITH FAITHFULNESS AND UPRIGHTNESS</small>.</p>

<title>9.1 Numbers 30:2ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 30:2&#x2013;3 [1&#x2013;2]:) <small>THEN MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE HEADS OF THE TRIBES &#x2026;: WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A VOW</small> (<italic>neder</italic>) <small>TO THE LORD</small>, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; Let our master instruct us: What about <italic>konamot</italic> (i.e., vows of abstinence) and vows (<italic>nedarim</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn1052">1</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Ned</italic>. 2:1): <small>&#x003C;IF ONE MAKES&#x003E; A <italic>KONAM</italic></small> (i.e., a vow of absitinence) [<small>THAT HE WILL NOT SLEEP, THAT HE WILL NOT SPEAK, THAT HE WILL NOT WALK; IF HE UTTERS A <italic>KONAM</italic> TO HIS WIFE THAT HE WILL NOT HAVE MARITAL RELATIONS WITH HER, SUCH A ONE IS LIABLE TO &#x003C;THE INJUNCTION&#x003E;</small> (in Numb. 30:3 [2]): <small>HE SHALL NOT BREAK HIS WORD. &#x003C;IF HE SWEARS&#x003E; AN OATH</small> (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ah</italic>)] <small>THAT HE WILL NOT SLEEP, THAT HE WILL NOT SPEAK, THAT HE WILL NOT WALK, HE IS FORBIDDEN &#x003C;TO DO SO&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">2</xref></sup> Oaths (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ot</italic>) carry more weight than vows (<italic>nedarim</italic>); and vows, than oaths. How so? &#x003C;If one makes&#x003E; a <italic>konam</italic> not to make a Sukkah, not to take up a Lulab, not to put on phylacteries, in the case of vows (<italic>nedarim</italic>) it is forbidden to put them on or to make them, even though they are commanded (in Torah); but in the case of oaths (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ot</italic>) it is permitted, because one does not swear to transgress against the commandments. The Holy One said to the Israelites: Be circumspect with your vows (<italic>nedarim</italic>) and do not break them, for all who break vows (<italic>nedarim</italic>) end up in being faithless in oaths (<italic>shevu&#x2019;ot</italic>). Moreover, the one who is faithless in oaths is denying me and will never have forgiveness, as stated (in Exod. 20:7 &#x003D; Deut. 5:11): <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL NOT TAKE THE NAME OF THE LORD YOUR GOD IN VAIN,&#x003E; FOR THE LORD WILL NOT EXONERATE &#x003C;ONE WHO TAKES HIS NAME IN VAIN&#x003E;</small>. It is also written (in Jer. 4:2): <small>AND YOU SHALL SWEAR: AS THE LORD LIVES, &#x003C;IN TRUTH, IN JUSTICE, AND IN RIGHTOUSNESS&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to the Israelites: Do not think that you have permission to swear in my name even in truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">3</xref></sup> You are not entitled to swear by my name unless you possess all the following attributes (of Deut. 10:20): <small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR</small>, [<small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE, TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST, AND BY HIM YOU SHALL SWEAR</small>]:</p>
<ol>
<li>That you should be like those three who were called God-fearing, Abraham, Job, and Joseph:
<ol>
<li>Abraham of whom it is written (in Gen. 22:12): <small>&#x003C;FOR NOW I KNOW&#x003E; THAT YOU FEAR GOD</small>.</li>
<li>Concerning Job it is written (in Job 1:1): <small>BLAMELESS AND UPRIGHT, ONE WHO FEARED GOD AND TURNED AWAY FROM EVIL</small>.</li>
<li>Concerning Joseph it is written (in Gen. 42:18): <small>FOR I FEAR GOD</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ergo (in Deut. 10:20):<small>THE LORD YOUR GOD YOU SHALL FEAR</small>.</p></li>
<li>[(Deut. 10:20, cont.:) <small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE</small>.] &#x003C;You do so,&#x003E; if you turn &#x003C;all&#x003E; your attention to the Torah, fulfill &#x003C;its&#x003E; commandments and have no other work. It therefore is stated (ibid.): <small>HIM YOU SHALL SERVE</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BD</small></italic>).</li>
<li>(Deut. 10:20, cont.:) <small>TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>. Can one hold fast to the Divine Presence? Moroever, has it not already been stated (in Deut. 4:24): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE?</small> It is simply &#x003C;being stated with reference to&#x003E; anyone marrying off his daughter to a scholar, who reads &#x003C;Scripture&#x003E; and recites &#x003C;Mishnah&#x003E;, that he engage in commerce<sup><xref rid="fn1055">4</xref></sup> for him and have him benefit from his assets.<sup><xref rid="fn1056">5</xref></sup> It is with reference to &#x003C;such a&#x003E; one that it is stated (in Deut. 10:20): <small>TO HIM YOU SHALL HOLD FAST</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have all these &#x003C;attributes&#x003E; you may swear; if not, you are not entitled to swear. There is a story &#x007B;that on the royal mountains (near Jerusalem)&#x007D; [about] King [Jannai], that he had two thousand towns on the royal mountains and that they all were destroyed because of a true oath. How? Someone would say to his friend: Upon my oath I am going to eat such and such at such and such a place, and I will drink such and such at such and such a place. Then they would go to fulfill their oath and would be destroyed.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">6</xref></sup> If this &#x003C;is what happens to&#x003E; one who swears truthfully, how much the worse it is for one who swears falsely&#x0021;</p>
<title>9.2 Numbers 31:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 31:1, 2, 6:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;ON THE MIDIANITES&#x003E;</small>. [&#x2026;. <small>WITH THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE TRUMPETS FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM IN HIS HAND</small>.] Let our master instruct us: How many sustained blasts (<italic>teqi&#x2018;ot</italic>) does one blow on eve of the Sabbath to detach the people from labor?<sup><xref rid="fn1058">7</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught (in <italic>Suk.</italic> 5:5): <small>ONE BLOWS THREE SUSTAINED BLASTS TO HAVE THE PEOPLE CEASE FROM LABOR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1059">8</xref></sup> How? The hazzan of the congregation takes the trumpets and goes up to the roof at the highest point in the city and blows. &#x003C;Thereupon&#x003E; whoever is far from the city leaves his work. Then he comes again and blows a second time. &#x003C;Thereupon&#x003E; those who are nearer enter the city. When he blows a third time, they place the <italic>hammin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1060">9</xref></sup> in the oven and light the &#x003C;Sabbath&#x003E; lights. &#x003C;If&#x003E; he has finished blowing &#x003C;while&#x003E; the pot was on the stove, they set it on the ground. If there was a light in a woman&#x2019;s hand, she set it on the ground. The Sabbath is sanctified with trumpets, and so also are New Moons and Festivals, as stated (in Numb. 10:10): <small>WHEN YOU HAVE A DAY OF REJOICING, AT YOUR FIXED FESTIVALS, AND ON YOUR NEW MOONS, YOU SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS</small>. Moreover, when they moved out &#x003C;from camp&#x003E;, they blew the trumpets to move out, as stated (in Numb. 10:6): <small>WHEN YOU BLOW</small> a [<small>SECOND</small>] <small>SHORT BLAST</small> (<italic>teru&#x2018;ah</italic>), <small>THE CAMPS &#x003C;PLACED TO THE SOUTH&#x003E; SHALL MOVE OUT&#x2026;.</small> Also when &#x003C;the congregation&#x003E; met together, they blew the trumpets, as stated (in vs. 7): <small>WHEN THE CONGREGATION ASSEMBLES, YOU SHALL BLOW &#x003C;SUSTAINED BLASTS AND NOT SHORT ONES&#x003E;</small>. And when an enemy oppresses you, you shall blow the trumpets, as stated (in vs. 9): <small>AND WHEN YOU GO TO WAR IN YOUR LAND AGAINST AN ENEMY WHO OPPRESSES YOU, YOU SHALL BLOW THE TRUMPETS</small>. And when they went to take vengeance against Midian, they carried out their vengeance with trumpets, as stated (in Numb. 31:6): <small>WITH THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY AND THE TRUMPETS FOR SOUNDING THE ALARM</small> (<italic>teru&#x2018;ah</italic>) <small>IN HIS HAND</small>.</p>
<title>9.3 Numbers 31:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 31:2:) <small>EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ON THE MIDIANITES; AFTERWARD YOU SHALL BE GATHERED UNTO YOUR PEOPLE</small>. R. Judah said: If Moses had wanted to live for several &#x003C;more&#x003E; years, he would have remained alive; for the Holy One had suspended his death until after the vengeance against Midian.<sup><xref rid="fn1061">10</xref></sup> Moses said: For the sake of my remaining alive, shall I delay Israel&#x2019;s vengeance on Midian? Immediately (in vs. 3): <small>MOSES SPOKE UNTO THE PEOPLE, SAYING: ARM SOME OF YOUR NUMBER</small> (<italic>anashim</italic>) <small>&#x003C;FOR THE ARMY, AND LET THEM FALL ON MIDIAN TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD AGAINST MIDIAN&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;The word, <italic>anashim,</italic> implies that they were&#x003E; righteous. So also elsewhere (in Exod. 17:9): <small>CHOOSE <italic>ANASHIM</italic> FOR US</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1062">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 31:3:) <small>TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD AGAINST MIDIAN</small>. The Holy One had said (in vs. 2): <small>THE VENGEANCE OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>; but Moses says (here in vs. 3): <small>THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD</small>. The Holy One said to them: It is your judgment that is called for, because they caused me to harm you. Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe, if we had been uncircumcised or practitioners of star worship or had denied &#x003C;the binding force of&#x003E; the commandments, they would not have persecuted us. On the contrary, &#x003C;they have done so precisely&#x003E; because of the Torah and commandments which you have given. The vengengeance, therefore, is yours. Ergo (in Numb. 31:3): <small>TO RENDER THE VENGEANCE OF THE LORD &#x003C;AGAINST MIDIAN&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>9.4 Numbers 31:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 31:4:) <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL SEND TO THE WAR&#x003E; A THOUSAND PER TRIBE &#x003C;FROM ALL THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. Some say: He sent two thousand from each and every tribe, while others say three thousand [from each and every tribe], with twelve thousand armed shock troops, twelve thousand to guard the baggage, and twelve thousand for prayer.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">12</xref></sup> And where is it shown? Where it is stated (ibid.): <small>A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small> (literally: <small>A THOUSAND PER TRIBE; A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small>).<sup><xref rid="fn1064">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Numb. 31:5:) <small>SO FROM THE THOUSANDS IN ISRAEL THERE WERE FURNISHED A THOUSAND PER TRIBE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WERE FURNISHED</small>? That they were furnished for each other in pairs<sup><xref rid="fn1065">14</xref></sup> &#x003C;Another interpretation of <small>WERE FURNISHED</small>:&#x003E; They <small>WERE FURNISHED</small> by force. Since Scripture had suspended the death of Moses until after the vengeance against Midian, they said: Shall we go against Midian and let Moses die? They refrained from going. The Holy One said to Moses: Cast lots over the tribes, and they will be furnished automatically.</p>
<title>9.5 Numbers 31:1ff., Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 31:6:) <small>THEN MOSES SENT THEM, &#x003C;A THOUSAND PER TRIBE ANONG WITH PHINEHAS BEN ELEAZAR THE PRIEST FOR THE TROOPS&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to Moses (in vs. 2): Take vengeance by yourself, but he sent others.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">15</xref></sup> It was simply because he had been raised in Midian. He said: It is not right for me to oppress those who have done well by me. The proverb says: Do not cast a stone into a cistern from which you have drunk water. But why did he send Phinehas before them (instead having someone else in command)? He said: Whoever has begun a religious act should finish it. &#x003C;Phinehas&#x003E; has (according to Numb. 25:11) <small>TURNED AROUND MY WRATH</small> (by executing an Israelite man copulating with the Midianite woman). Let him finish the act.</p>
<p>(Numb. 31:6, cont.:) <small>AND THE VESSELS OF THE SANCTUARY</small> (<italic>haqodesh</italic>). This refers to the Ark (and its contents), since it is stated (in Numb. 7:9): <small>BECAUSE THEY</small> (i.e., the children of Korah) <small>HAD THE SERVICE OF THE HOLY</small> (<italic>haqodesh</italic>) <small>OBJECTS, WHICH THEY CARRIED ON THE SHOULDER</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">16</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: These were the priestly garments, for in them were the Urim and Thummim, as stated (in Exod. 29:29): <small>AND THE SACRED</small> (<italic>haqodesh</italic>) <small>GARMENTS OF AARON</small>. (Numb. 31:8:) <small>THEY ALSO KILLED BALAAM BEN PEOR WITH THE SWORD</small>. Now what was he doing there? He had simply gone to receive a reward for twenty-four thousand that had fallen through his counsel.</p>
<p>(Numb. 31:11&#x2013;12:) <small>THEN THEY TOOK ALL THE PLUNDER &#x2026;, AND THEY BROUGHT THE &#x003C; PRISONERS, THE BOOTY &#x2026; &#x003E; UNTO MOSES&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;This text serves&#x003E; to show their excellence, for they did not want to take the spoils, until they had brought them before him; and after that [they &#x003C;only&#x003E; took &#x003C;them&#x003E;] with his permission.</p>
<p>(Numb. 31:13:) <small>THEN MOSES, ELEAZAR THE PRIEST, &#x003C;AND PRINCES OF THE CONGREGATION&#x003E; WENT OUT &#x003C;TO MEET THEM&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This text serves&#x003E; to show Moses&#x2019; humility, for they all were disciples of his disciples.</p>
<title>9.6 Numbers 31:1ff., Part V</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 31:2:) <small>EXACT VENGEANCE FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. This text is related (to Job 36:7): <small>HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS EYES FROM A RIGHTEOUS PERSON</small>. What is the meaning of <small>HE DOES NOT WITHDRAW HIS EYES FROM A RIGHTEOUS PERSON</small> (literally: <small>WITHDRAW FROM A REGHTEOUS PERSON HIS EYES</small>)? The Holy One does not keep back from a righteous person what he wants to see with his eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">17</xref></sup> &#x003C;The text&#x003E; teaches that Moses longed to see vengeance on the Midianites before he died. Thus it is stated concerning him (in Ps. 58:11 [10]): <small>A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WILL REJOICE WHEN HE SEES VENGEANCE</small>. (Ibid.:) <small>A RIGHTEOUS PERSON WILL REJOICE</small>. This refers to Moses. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WHEN HE SEES VENGEANCE</small>, i.e., vengeance on Midian. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>HE WILL BATHE HIS FEET IN THE BLOOD OF THE WICKED PERSON</small>, i.e., of Balaam.</p>
<title>9.7 Numbers 32:1ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 32:1:) <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN &#x003C;AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD&#x003E; HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK&#x2026;</small>. Let our master instruct us: How many good gifts were created in the world?<sup><xref rid="fn1069">18</xref></sup> [Thus have our masters taught: The Holy One created three gifts in the world:] wisdom, strength, and wealth. A person meriting one of them receives what is most desirable in the whole world. When? When they come from the Holy One and come through the power of the Torah. But human strength and wealth are nothing, for thus has Solomon stated (in Eccl. 9:11): <small>AGAIN I SAW THAT UNDER THE SUN THAT THE RACE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE SWIFT, NOR THE BATTLE TO THE STRONG, NOR BREAD TO THE WISE, NOR EVEN WEALTH TO THE DISCERNING, &#x003C;NOR EVEN FAVOR TO THE KNOWLEDGEABLE,&#x003E; FOR TIME AND AFFLICTION</small> (i.e., death) <small>ENCOUNTER ALL OF THEM</small>. Thus also has Jeremiah stated (in Jer. 9:22 [23]): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: LET NOT THE WISE BOAST IN THEIR WISDOM, NOR THE STRONG BOAST IN THEIR STRENGTH, NOR THE WEALTHY BOAST IN THEIR WEALTH</small>. So these gifts, since they do not come from the Holy One, will finally be cut off from them.</p>
<title>9.8 Numbers 32:1ff., Part II</title>
<p>The sages (literally: the wise) have taught: Two wise men arose in the world, one from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Balaam was from the nations of the world, while Ahitophel was from Israel; but both of them were lost from this world and from the world to come. [Two strong men arose in the world, one was from Israel and one from the nations of the world. Samson was from Israel, while Goliath was from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world.] Two wealthy men arose in the world, Korah from Israel and Haman from the nations of the world; but both of them were lost from the world. Why? Because their gift was not from Heaven. So also you find among the children of Gad and the children of Reuben that they were very wealthy and had a lot of livestock, but they loved the livestock and resided outside the land of Israel. For that reason they were the first of the tribes to go into exile, as stated (in I Chron. 5:26): <small>AND HE CARRIED THEM INTO EXILE</small>, i.e., <small>THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES</small>. [Who brought &#x003C;the exile&#x003E; on them? &#x003C;It happened&#x003E; because they had separated themselves from their siblings for the sake of their livestock. And where is it shown? From what they read on the subject (in Numb. 32:1): <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>.]</p>
<title>9.9 Numbers 32:1ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Nume. 32:1:) <small>MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 75:7&#x2013;8 [6&#x2013;7]): <small>FOR IT IS NOT FROM THE EAST OR FROM THE WEST OR FROM THE WILDERNESS THAT THERE COMES AN EXALTATION</small> (<italic>harim</italic>), <small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES; ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7 [6]:) <small>FOR IT IS NOT FROM THE EAST</small> (rt.: <italic><small>MT</small>s</italic>&#x2019;) <small>OR FROM THE WEST</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1070">19</xref></sup> It is not from the fact that, when a person works hard by going out (rt.: <italic><small>MT</small>s</italic>&#x2019;) for trade and traveling from east to west, he becomes wealthy. &#x003C;No&#x0021;&#x003E; Even if one sails away in ships to go from east to west and returns over wildnesses and over mountains (<italic>harim</italic>), he does not become wealthy. What is the meaning of (Ps. 75:7 [6], cont.:) <small>OR FROM THE WILDERNESS THAT THERE COMES AN EXALTATION</small> (<italic>harim</italic>)? R. Abba<sup><xref rid="fn1071">20</xref></sup> says: Every use of <italic>harim</italic> in Scripture denotes mountains except for here, where it denotes exaltation. Thus one is not exalted from these things. So what does the Holy One do? He takes from one and gives to another. A certain matron asked R. Jose ben Halafta: In how many days did the Holy One create his world? He said to her in six days.<sup><xref rid="fn1072">21</xref></sup> She said to him: And what has he been doing since that time? He said to her: He sits down and makes ladders for raising up one and putting down another. You yourself know that, when he wanted the children of Reuben and Gad to become wealthy, he brought down the Midianites at their hand. What is written (in Numb. 31:9)? <small>THEN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL TOOK THE WOMEN</small> [<small>AND CHILDREN</small>] <small>OF THE MIDIANITES CAPTIVE</small>, [<small>AND ALL THEIR CATTLE, ALL THEIR LIVESTOCK</small>,] <small>&#x003C;AND ALL THEIR WEALTH THEY SEIZED AS PLUNDER&#x003E;</small>. Then after that &#x003C;comes&#x003E; (Numb. 32:1:) <small>NOW THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN &#x003C;AND THE CHILDREN OF GAD&#x003E; HAD MUCH LIVESTOCK</small>. Ergo (in Ps. 75:8 [7]): <small>FOR IT IS GOD WHO JUDGES; ONE HE PUTS DOWN, AND ANOTHER HE LIFTS UP</small>. And who is wealthy? One who is happy with his lot, as stated (in Ps. 128:2): <small>YOU SHALL EAT THE PRODUCE OF YOUR HANDS; YOU SHALL BE HAPPY, AND IT SHALL GO WELL WITH YOU</small>.</p>

<title>10.1 Numbers 33:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES &#x003C;BY WHICH&#x003E; OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;WENT FORTH FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E;</small>. Let our master instruct us: When a person is being pursued by robbers and brigands,<sup><xref rid="fn1073">1</xref></sup> is it permissible for such a one to profane the Sabbath. Thus have our masters taught: When a person is being pursued by robbers and brigands, such a one does profane the Sabbath to save his life.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">2</xref></sup> We therefore find in the case of David, that when Saul sought to kill him, he fled from him and was saved.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">3</xref></sup> Our masters have said: Once upon a time evil documents came from the Empire for the leading citizens of Sepphoris.<sup><xref rid="fn1076">4</xref></sup> &#x003C;The citizens&#x003E; came to R. Eliezer ben Parta &#x003C;and&#x003E; said to him: Evil documents have come to us from the Empire. What do you say? Shall we flee? Since he was afraid to tell them to flee on the Sabbath, he said to them: Are you asking me? Go and ask Jacob, Moses, and David. With reference to Jacob, it is written (in Hos. 12:13 [12]): <small>THEN JACOB FLED</small>. With reference to Moses, it is written (in Exod. 2:15): <small>BUT MOSES FLED FROM PHARAOH</small>. With reference to David, it is written (in I Sam. 19:18) <small>NOW DAVID FLED AND ESCAPED</small>. It also says (in Is. 26:20): <small>GO, MY PEOPLE, ENTER YOUR CHAMBERS&#x2026;</small>. But where is it shown that the saving of life overrides the Sabbath? Where it is written (in Lev. 18:5): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP MY STATUTES AND ORDINANCES, FOR IT IS THROUGH PERFORMING THEM THAT A PERSON SHALL LIVE</small> and not die through them. It is also written, with reference to circumcision (in Lev. 12:3): <small>AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY THE FLESH OF HIS FORESKIN SHALL BE CIRCUMCISED</small>, even on the Sabbath. Now are not &#x003C; these &#x003E; words &#x003C;an argument&#x003E; <italic>qal wahomer?</italic> If circumcision, which concerns &#x003C;but&#x003E; one out of the 248 [human] members, overrides the Sabbath, how much the more in the case of the whole body. The Holy One said [to Israel]: My children, be mindful of my ordinances and keep the Torah, for how many miracles and wonders have I done for you from the day that you went forth from Egypt&#x0021; I cast down those who hated you, I had you pass through the sea, I cast fear and trembling on your enemies, I destroyed the Amorites along with Sihon and Og, and during the whole forty years that you were in the wilderness I did not forsake you for a single hour. Moreover, how many snakes and scorpions did I exterminate in your presence. It is so stated (in Deut. 8:15): (<small>GOD</small>) <small>WHO LED YOU THROUGH THE GREAT AND TERRIBLE WILDERNESS WITH ITS FIERY SERPENTS AND SCORPIONS</small>. Therefore, the Holy One said to Moses: Write down the stages by which Israel journeyed in the wilderness, so that they will know how many miracles I performed for them during each and every stage. &#x007B;Thus it is stated (in Numb. 33:1&#x2013;2):&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter (in Numb. 33:1&#x2013;2):] <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES &#x003C;BY WHICH&#x003E; THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;WENT FORTH FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E;&#x2026;. AND MOSES WROTE DOWN THEIR STARTING POINGS, STAGE BY STAGE, ACCORDING TO THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>10.2 Numbers 33:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES</small>.] &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a king whose son was ill.<sup><xref rid="fn1077">5</xref></sup> He brought him to a certain place to heal him. When they returned, his father began recounting the stages: Here we slept. Here we cooled off. Here you had a headache. Similarly the Holy One said to Moses: Recount to them all the places where they provoked me. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 33:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE STAGES</small>.</p>
<title>10.3 Numbers 34:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 34:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL &#x003C;AND SAY UNTO THEM&#x003E;: WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN, &#x003C;THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCES &#x003C;THIS IS THE LAND&#x003E;</small><sup><xref rid="fn1078">6</xref></sup> teaches that the Holy One showed Moses all that had been and all that was going to be.<sup><xref rid="fn1079">7</xref></sup> He showed him Samson arising from Dan and Barak, from Naphtali. So also it was for every generation with its expounders, every generation with leaders,<sup><xref rid="fn1080">8</xref></sup> every generation with its sages, every generation with its wicked, every generation with its righteous.</p>
<p>(Deut. 34:4:) <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO HIM: THIS IS THE LAND WHICH I SWORE TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB, SAYING: &#x003C;I WILL GIVE IT TO YOUR SEED; I HAVE LET YOU SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> The Holy One said to Moses: The oath that I swore to them I have fulfilled for their children. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 34:1): <small>SAYING</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1081">9</xref></sup></p>
<title>10.4 Numbers 34:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>It is written (in Josh. 7:19): <small>THEN JOSHUA SAID UNTO ACHAN: &#x003C;MY SON, PLEASE GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND MAKE A CONFESSION TO HIM. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME</small>.&#x003E; Achan said to him: Am I to die because of this thing that you are saying unto me?<sup><xref rid="fn1082">10</xref></sup> When Achan saw &#x003C;the situation&#x003E;, he said in his heart: Now I shall be entrapped by the lot. Then I shall be found untrue (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>MN</small></italic>) and deemed a liar before Joshua. At that moment Achan said to Joshua: Why are you casting lots between me and my house? Let me cast lots between you and Phinehas&#x0021; If the lot does not come up for both of you, I also shall believe (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>MN</small></italic>). At that moment (according to Josh. 7:19) [<small>THEN</small>] <small>JOSHUA SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>TO</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>ACHAN: MY SON, PLEASE GIVE GLORY TO THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL AND MAKE A CONFESSION</small> [<small>TO HIM</small>]. <small>PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE</small>. Achan said to him: You also tell me what you have done. Immediately discord broke out in Israel, so that &#x003C;Achan&#x2019;s&#x003E; tribe of Judah arose in strife and killed one group after another in Israel. When Achan saw this, he said in his heart: If anyone saves a single life in Israel, it is as though he had saved the entire world; yet in my case, it has been through me that so many people in Israel have been killed. I am a sinner and one who causes &#x003C;others&#x003E; to sin. It is better &#x003C;for me&#x003E; to confess my transgression before the Holy One and before Joshua, so that no calamity come about through me. What did Achan do? He arose and made his voice heard, so that the whole congregation became silent before him. He said to Joshua (in vs. 20): <small>I AM THE ONE WHO REALLY SINNED BEFORE THE LORD GOD OF ISRAEL. THUS AND SO</small> (literally: <small>LIKE THIS AND LIKE THIS</small>) <small>IS WHAT I HAVE DONE</small>. So it was not <small>THIS</small> alone, but I have already acted fraudulently in other matters.<sup><xref rid="fn1083">11</xref></sup> Joshua said to him: Indeed I also knew that you were responsible for the situation. (Josh. 7:19:) <small>PLEASE TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. DO NOT HIDE IT FROM ME</small>. (vs. 21): <small>I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS</small>. [He had said to himself:] I have seen what is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:14): <small>YOU MAY EAT THE SPOILS OF YOUR ENEMIES</small>. (Josh. 7:21) <small>&#x003C;I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS&#x003E; A FINE SHINAR MANTLE&#x2026;</small>. Now do not say that I am poor and in need, for there is no one in the tribe of Judah more wealthy than I. Immediately (there follows vs. 22): <small>THEN JOSHUA SENT MESSENGERS, AND THEY RAN TO THE TENT&#x2026;.</small> For what reason did Joshua send them? So that the tribe [of Judah] would not steal them (i.e., the stolen articles) and continue in the discord. Joshua therefore sent quickly, <small>AND</small> (according to vs. 23) <small>THEY BROUGHT THEM UNTO JOSHUA AND UNTO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL; AND THEY SPREAD THEM OUT BEFORE THE LORD</small>. What is the significance of <small>AND THEY SPREAD THEM OUT?</small> Joshua said: Sovereign of the World, is it because of these that you have been angry with your children? Here they are set before you. Immediately &#x003C;we read&#x003E; (in vs. 24): <small>THEN JOSHUA, &#x003C;AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM,&#x003E; TOOK ACHAN ACHAN BEN ZERAH, &#x003C;THE SILVER, THE MANTLE, AND THE WEDGE OF GOLD</small>,&#x003E; [<small>TOGETHER WITH HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS</small>.] &#x003C;He took&#x003E; <small>HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS</small> in order to teach them a lesson, but <small>HIS OX, HIS ASS</small>, &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND HIS TENT</small> &#x003C;he took&#x003E; for burning. &#x003C;He took&#x003E; <small>ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM</small> to see his punishment so that they would not become accustomed to acting in this way. (Vs. 24, cont.:) <small>AND THEY BROUGHT THEM UP TO THE VALLEY OF ACHOR</small> (<italic>akhor</italic>; rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>KR</small></italic>). (vs. 25:) <small>THEN JOSHUA SAID: JUST AS YOU HAVE AFFLICTED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>KR</small></italic>) <small>US</small>, [<small>MAY THE LORD AFFLICT</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>KR</small></italic>) <small>YOU</small>] <small>THIS DAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">12</xref></sup> <small>THIS DAY</small> &#x003C;only&#x003E; is he to be afflicted (&#x2018;<italic>akhur</italic>; rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>KR</small></italic>), but he will have a share in the world to come. (Vs. 25, cont.:) <small>THEN ALL ISRAEL PELTED HIM WITH STONES</small>, him alone, <small>AND THEY BURNED THEM WITH FIRE</small>. The text is speaking of his wealth, for so it had been told him by the Almighty (in vs. 15): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN SEIZED WITH WHAT HAS BEEN PROSCRIBED SHALL BE BURNED WITH FIRE TOGETHER WITH ALL THAT HE HAS</small>. &#x003C;This passage&#x003E; is only to teach you that Achan had confessed that he had stolen them on the Sabbath, when he took them out of Jericho and concealed them in the midst of his tent. Thus he was stoned for profaning the Sabbath and burned because he had transgressed the ban. And where is it shown? You find that the Holy One said so to Joshua (in Josh. 6:2&#x2013;4): <small>SEE, I HAVE GIVEN JERICHO INTO YOUR HANDS, ALONG WITH ITS KING AND THE MIGHTY WARRIORS. SO YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY WITH ALL THE MEN OF WAR TO ENCOMPASS THE CITY ONE TIME. THUS SHALL YOU DO FOR SIX DAYS WITH SEVEN PRIESTS&#x2026;. &#x003C;BUT ON THE SEVENTH DAY YOU SHALL GO AROUND THE CITY SEVEN TIMES, AND THE PRIESTS SHALL BLOW ON THE SHOPHARS</small>. This passage serves&#x003E; to teach you that Jericho was conquered on the Sabbath. Now Joshua did this thing on his own with the Holy One giving his consent. Joshua said (to himself): The Sabbath is holy, as stated (in Exod. 31:14): <small>YOU SHALL KEEP THE SABBATH, BECAUSE IT IS HOLY FOR YOU</small>. So whatever we conquer on it shall be holy, as stated (in Josh. 6:19): <small>BUT ALL THE SILVER AND GOLD</small>, [<small>AND THE VESSELS OF BRONZE AND IRON, ARE HOLY TO THE LORD</small>]. And where is it shown that he gave his consent? Where it is stated (in Joshua 6:17): [<small>THE CITY</small>] <small>AND EVERYTHING IN IT &#x003C;ARE TO BE&#x003E; PROSCRIBED FOR THE LORD</small>. At that time (according to Josh. 7:26) <small>THE LORD TURNED FROM HIS BURNING ANGER</small>. Concerning &#x003C;this matter&#x003E;, it is stated (in Prov. 16:14): <small>THE KING</small>&#x2019;s <small>ANGER IS LIKE MESSEGERS OF DEATH, AND WHOEVER IS WISE WILL APPEASE IT</small>. This refers to Joshua, who caused the burning anger of the Lord to turn away from Israel.</p>
<title>10.5 Numbers 34:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Numb. 34:1&#x2013;2:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES, SAYING: COMMAND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY UNTO THEM: WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN, &#x003C;THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Let our master instruct us: Before they entered the land, how did they say the blessing over the food?<sup><xref rid="fn1085">13</xref></sup> Thus have our masters taught: Before they entered the land, they used to say a single blessing, <italic>Who Sustains All</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">14</xref></sup> After they had entered the land, they said the blessing, <italic>For the Land and for the Food</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">15</xref></sup> After Jerusalem was destroyed, they added <italic>Builder of Jerusalem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">16</xref></sup> After those slain at Bethther<sup><xref rid="fn1089">17</xref></sup> were buried, they added <italic>Who is Good and Does What is Good:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1090">18</xref></sup> <italic>Who is Good,</italic> because they did not decay, and <italic>Who Does What is Good,</italic> because they were given burials. None of them, however, is more dear to you than the blessing of the land. The sages therefore instruct: In the blessing of the food, whoever does not mention <italic>For the Land and for the Food</italic>; <italic>A Desirable, Good, and Spacious Land;</italic> the covenant &#x003C;of circumcision&#x003E;; Torah; life; and food<sup><xref rid="fn1091">19</xref></sup> has not satisfied his obligation.<sup><xref rid="fn1092">20</xref></sup> The Holy One said: the land of Israel is more dear to me than everything. I am the one who sought it out, as stated (in Ezek. 20:6): <small>&#x003C;ON THAT DAY I SWORE</small> (literally: <small>RAISED MY HAND</small>) <small>TO THEM THAT I WOULD BRING THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E; UNTO</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; [<small>A</small>] <small>LAND WHICH I HAD SOUGHT OUT FOR THEM</small>. So also it says (in Jer. 3:19): <small>&#x003C;HOW I WOULD PUT YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN&#x003E; AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND &#x003C;THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS&#x003E;</small>. You find &#x003C;the same love for the land&#x003E;, when Joshua slew those kings. R. Jannay the Priest said: There were sixty-two kings, thirty-one at Jericho and thirty one with Sisera. When he went to fight with Israel they also were slain along with him. Why? Because they along with him yearned to drink water from the waters of Israel. They made a request of Sisera and said to him: If you please, let us come with you for free, because we yearn to fill our stomachs with water from the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Jud. 5:19): <small>THE KINGS CAME, THEY FOUGHT; &#x003C;THEN FOUGHT THE KINGS OF CANAAN, AT TAANACH, ON ACCOUNT OF</small><sup><xref rid="fn1093">21</xref></sup> <small>THE WATERS OF MEGIDDO;&#x003E; THEY TOOK NO GAIN OF MONEY</small>. &#x003C;This verse serves&#x003E; to inform you of the esteem in which the land of Israel was held. The Holy One had said to Moses: This land is dear to me, as stated (in Deut. 11:12): <small>A LAND FOR WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD CARES</small>. Israel also is dear to me, as stated (in Deut. 7:8): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES YOU&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One said: [Because Israel] is dear to me, I will bring [them] into a land that is dear to me. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what they read on the subject] (in Numb. 34:2): <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND &#x003C;OF CANAAN, THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>10.6 Numbers 34:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Numb. 34:2:) <small>WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>. [What is written above on the matter (in Numb. 33:52)? <small>YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND FROM BEFORE YOU</small>.] This text is related (to Job 35:11): <small>WHO TEACHES US THROUGH THE BEASTS OF</small> &#x007B;<small>THE</small>&#x007D; <small>EARTH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1094">22</xref></sup> He said to Israel: Learn from the bull of Elijah; for in the hour that Elijah said (in I Kings 18:25) <small>TO THE</small> &#x007B;<small>WORSHIPERS</small>&#x007D; [<small>PROPHETS</small>] <small>OF BAAL: CHOOSE ONE BULL FOR YOURSELVES AND PREPARE IT FIRST</small>, at that very hour the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred &#x007B;and fifty&#x007D; prophets of Asherah gathered together and were unable to budge its foot from the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">23</xref></sup> Look at what is written there (in vs. 23): <small>LET THEM GIVE US TWO BULLS&#x2026;</small>. Elijah said to them: Choose two bulls for yourselves, twins from the same mother, who are being fattened at the same manger. Cast lots over them, one for the Name (i.e., the Holy One) and one for Baal. They choose the one bull for themselves. Now Elijah&#x2019;s bull kept following him; but as for that bull which had been assigned to the name of Baal, all those prophets of Baal plus the prophets of Asherah assembled to move &#x003C;even&#x003E; its foot from the ground, and were unable to do so, until Elijah began to say &#x003C;to it&#x003E; for them: Go with them. The bull answered and spoke to Elijah before the eyes of all the people by saying to him: My colleague and I came out of the same womb, and we grew up in the same pasture at the same feeding trough. That one was assigned to the portion of the Holy One, and the name of the Holy One is sanctified through him. So have I been assigned to the portion of Baal to provoke my creator? Elijah said to him: Go with them, and do not let them find an excuse. Just as the name of the Holy One is being sanctified through this one with me, so will it be sanctified through you. He said to him: Now that you have given me this advice, I swear that I will not move from here until you deliver me into their hand. Thus it is stated (in vs. 26): <small>SO THEY TOOK THE BULL THAT HE GAVE TO THEM AND PREPARED IT</small>. And who gave it to them? Elijah. You also learn that Elijah said to them (in vs. 25): <small>CHOOSE ONE BULL FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Then at the end &#x003C;of the verse&#x003E; is written (ibid. cont.): <small>AND THEY TOOK THE BULL WHICH HE HAD GIVEN THEM</small>. It is therefore stated (in Job 35:11): <small>WHO TEACHES US THROUGH THE BEASTS OF &#x003C;THE&#x003E; EARTH</small>. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND</small> &#x007B;<small>YOU MAKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE MAKES</small>] <small>US WISE THROUGH THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">24</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Learn &#x003C;a lesson&#x003E; from the ravens who fed Elijah, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 17: 4, 6): <small>AND I HAVE COMMANDED THE RAVENS TO FEED YOU THERE</small>&#x2026; [<small>SO THE RAVENS BROUGHT HIM BREAD AND MEAT&#x2026;</small>.] From where did they bring him (in vs. 6) <small>BREAD AND MEAT IN THE MORNING, AND BREAD AND MEAT IN THE EVENING</small>? From Jehoshaphat&#x2019;s table, because those ravens did not want to enter Ahab&#x2019;s house to take anything from the table of that evil man for this righteous man. &#x003C;They would not go there&#x003E; because his house was full of idolatry. Ergo (in Job 35:11): &#x007B;<small>YOU MAKE</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE MAKES</small>] <small>US WISE THROUGH THE BIRDS OF THE HEAVENS</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: Learn from the bull and from the ravens, and do not turn unto idols to look at them. &#x007B;Thus it is stated&#x007D; [Where is it shown? From what they read on the matter&#x007D; (in Numb. 33:52): <small>YOU SHALL DISPOSSESS ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE LAND</small>.</p>
<title>10.7 Numbers 34:1ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Numb. 34:2:) <small>WHEN YOU COME &#x003C;INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Jeremiah 2:31): <small>YOU, O GENERATION, UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF THE LORD&#x0021;</small> [<small>HAVE I BEEN A DESERT</small> (<italic><small>HMDBR</small></italic>, voweled as (<italic>hamidbar</italic>) <small>TO ISRAEL</small>] &#x2026;?

(Ibid., cont.:) <small>OR A LAND OF UTTER DARKNESS</small> (<italic>ma&#x2019;pelyah</italic>)? What is the meaning of <italic>ma&#x2019;pelyah</italic> (rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>)? Did I, perhaps, promise you to bring you into the land and &#x003C;then&#x003E; delay you? After all <italic>ma&#x2019;pelyah</italic> can only mean &#x201C;delay,&#x201D; as stated (in Exod. 9:32): <small>&#x003C;BUT THE WHEAT AND THE SPELT WERE NOT HURT&#x003E; BECAUSE THEY RIPEN LATE</small> (i.e., <small>ARE DELAYED</small>, rt.: &#x2019;<italic><small>PL</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1098">26</xref></sup> See, you will be entering into its midst, <small>WHEN</small> (according to Numb. 34:2) <small>YOU COME INTO THE LAND OF CANAAN</small> (<italic>Kena&#x2018;an</italic>), &#x003C;i.e., into&#x003E; a land of business,<sup><xref rid="fn1099">27</xref></sup> a land of trade. &#x003C;The usage is&#x003E; just as you say (in Is. 23:8 with reference to Tyre): <small>WHOSE TRADERS</small> (<italic>kena&#x2018;anim</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1100">28</xref></sup> <small>THE WORLD HONORED</small>.</p>
<p>(Numb. 34:2): <small>THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO YOU? TO YOU</small> it is fitting.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">29</xref></sup> &#x003C;The matter&#x003E; is comparable to a king who had male and female slaves and would have his male slaves marry &#x003C;female slaves&#x003E; from another estate.<sup><xref rid="fn1102">30</xref></sup> The king stopped and reflected. He said: The male slaves are mine and the female slaves are mine. It would be better for me to marry my male slaves (&#x2018;<italic>avadim</italic>) to my female slaves, &#x007B;my own to my own&#x007D; [who belong to me]. Similarly the Holy One said: The land is mine, as stated (in Lev. 25:23): <small>FOR THE LAND BELONGS TO ME&#x2026;.</small> It also says (in Ps. 24:1): <small>THE LAND IS THE LORD&#x2019;S AND ALL THAT IS IN IT&#x2026;</small>. Moreover Israel is mine, as stated (in Lev. 25:55): <small>FOR TO ME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE SERVANTS</small> (&#x2018;<italic>avadim</italic>). It is [better for me to bequeath my lands to my servants who belong to me, to a people who belong to me. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 34:2): <small>THIS IS THE LAND THAT SHALL FALL TO YOU AS AN INHERITANCE</small>.</p>
<title>10.8 Numbers 35:9ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Numb. 35:9&#x2013;11:) <small>AND THE LORD SPOKE &#x003C;UNTO MOSES, SAYING&#x003E;: SPEAK UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, &#x003C;AND SAY UNTO THEM:&#x003E; WHEN YOU CROSS &#x003C;THE JORDAN TO THE LAND OF CANAAN, YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH CITIES TO BE CITIES OF REFUGE, WHERE A KILLER MAY FLEE WHO HAS TAKEN A LIFE BY MISTAKE&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 25:8): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD AND STRAIGHTFORWARD; THEREFORE HE INSTRUCTS SINNERS IN THE WAY</small>. (Ibid., vs. 6:) <small>BE MINDFUL OF YOUR MERCIES, O LORD, AND OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE&#x2026;</small>. David said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the Universe, were it not for your mercies, which took precedence for the first Adam, he would not have survived.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">31</xref></sup> Although you said to him (in Gen. 2:17): <small>FOR ON THE DAY THAT YOU EAT FROM IT, YOU SHALL SURELY DIE</small>, you did not act in that way. Instead you excluded him from the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>SO HE DROVE OUT THE HUMAN</small>. So why was he driven out? Because he had brought death to &#x003C;all future&#x003E; generations, he should have died immediately; but because you were merciful to him, you &#x003C;simply&#x003E; drove him out. It is the same with one who kills by mistake, when he goes into exile into the cities of refuge. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 25:6): <small>BE MINDFUL OF YOUR MERCIES, O LORD, AND OF YOUR STEADFAST LOVE</small>,&#x2026;. When Moses arose, the Holy One said to him (in Numb. 35:11): <small>YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOURSELVES WITH CITIES &#x003C;TO BE CITIES OF REFUGE&#x003E;,&#x2026;</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the Universe, when someone takes a life by mistake in the South or in the North, how will he know where the cities of refuge are, to which he should flee? He said to him (in Deut. 19:3): <small>YOU YOURSELF SHALL PREPARE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TKN</small></italic>) <small>THE ROAD</small> (<italic>derekh</italic>). You yourself shall make the roads &#x003C;to these cities&#x003E; straight (rt.: <italic><small>TKN</small></italic>), so that &#x003C;anyone fleeing to them&#x003E; will not go astray for the blood avenger to find him and kill him, <small>WHEN</small> (according to vs. 6) <small>HE DID NOT INCUR THE DEATH PENALTY</small>. He said to him: How? He said to him: Erect road markers<sup><xref rid="fn1104">32</xref></sup> directing (rt.: <italic><small>TKN</small></italic>) &#x003C;such a refugee&#x003E; to the cities of refuge, so that he will know how to go there; and on every marker inscribe: &#x003C;Involuntary&#x003E; killers to the cities of refuge, as stated (in Deut. 19:3): <small>YOU YOURSELF SHALL PREPARE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TKN</small></italic>) <small>THE ROAD</small> (<italic>derekh</italic>)&#x2026;. Thus David has said (in Ps. 25:8): <small>THE LORD IS GOOD AND STRAIGHTFORWARD; THEREFORE HE INSTRUCTS SINNERS IN THE WAY</small> (<italic>derekh</italic>). &#x003C;Now&#x003E; if for killers he has made a way and a road (<italic>derekh</italic>; rt.: <italic><small>DRK</small></italic> for them to flee and escape death), how much the more so in the case of the righteous. (Ps. 25:9:) <small>HE LEADS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DRK</small></italic>) <small>THE LOWLY IN THE RIGHT PATH</small>.</p>
<title>10.9 Numbers 35:9ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Numb. 35:11:) <small>WHERE A KILLER MAY FLEE WHO HAS TAKEN A LIFE BY MISTAKE</small>, and not on purpose. If someone goes and kills on purpose, then says: It was by mistake that I killed, and flees to &#x003C;one of the&#x003E; cities of refuge, the Holy One says: Even if he comes in and flees to my altar, kill him, according to what is stated (in Exod. 21:14): <small>BUT WHEN SOMEONE PLOTS AGAINST &#x003C;HIS COMPANION AND KILLS HIM TREACHEROUSLY&#x003E;, YOU SHALL TAKE HIM AWAY &#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; FROM MY ALTAR &#x003C;FOR EXECUTION&#x003E;</small>. Who was this person who fled to the altar and was killed? This was Joab, of whom it is stated (in I Kings 2:28): <small>WHEN THE NEWS CAME TO JOAB,&#x2026;. &#x003C;JOAB FLED UNTO THE TENT OF THE LORD&#x003E; AND SEIZED THE HORNS OF THE ALTAR</small>. You find that Joab was a great sage and the head of the Sanhedrin,<sup><xref rid="fn1105">33</xref></sup> as stated (in II Sam. 23:8): <small>ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1106">34</xref></sup> But did he not know what is written in the Torah (in Exod. 21:14): <small>&#x003C;BUT WHEN SOMEONE PLOTS AGAINST HIS COMPANION AND KILLS HIM TREACHEROUSLY&#x003E;, YOU SHALL TAKE HIM AWAY &#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; FROM MY ALTAR FOR EXECUTION</small>, [when he went and seized the horns of the altar]?<sup><xref rid="fn1107">35</xref></sup> It is simply that [Joab] had said: Those killed by a court of law are not buried in the graves of their ancestors but by themselves. It is better to die here, so that I may be buried with my ancestors. (I Kings 2:30&#x2013;31:) <small>THEN BENAIAH BROUGHT BACK WORD UNTO THE KING, SAYING: THUS HAS JOAB SPOKEN AND THUS DID HE ANSWER ME. SO THE KING SAID TO HIM: DO AS HE HAS SPOKEN, STRIKE HIM DOWN AND BURY HIM</small>. Why was he killed? Because his (Solomon&#x2019;s) father, David, had ordered him &#x003C;to do&#x003E; so (in I Kings 2:5&#x2013;6): <small>MOREOVER, YOU ALSO KNOW WHAT JOAB BEN ZERUIAH DID TO ME&#x2026;. &#x003C;SO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR WISDOM, AND DO NOT LET HIS GRAY HAIR GO DOWN TO SHEOL IN PEACE</small>.&#x003E; What did he do to him? You find that, when David wrote to Joab (in II Sam. 11:15): <small>SET URIAH IN THE FRONT LINE WHERE THE FIGHTING IS THE FIERCEST</small>, he did so, and he was killed. All the army leaders assembled against Joab, as stated of him (in II Sam. 23:39): <small>URIAH THE HITTITE</small>, &#x003C;was one of&#x003E; <small>ALL</small> &#x003C;those&#x003E; &#x007B;<small>THIRTY-SIX</small>&#x007D; [<small>THIRTY-SEVEN</small>&#x007D; &#x003C;leaders&#x003E;. He showed them the document. It is therefore stated (in I Kings 2:5): [<small>YOU KNOW</small>] <small>WHAT</small> [<small>JOAB BEN ZERUIAH</small>] <small>DID TO ME AND WHAT HE DID TO THE TWO COMMANDERS OF ISRAEL&#x2019;</small>s <small>FORCES, TO ABNER BEN NER &#x003C;AND TO AMASA BEN JETHER&#x003E;</small> [&#x2026;.] They had been of the opinion that David had ordered him to kill him because Abner was Saul&#x2019;s cousin, and for that reason David arose and cursed Joab, when he said (in II Sam. 3:29): <small>MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK &#x003C;ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, ONE WHO GRASPS THE CRUTCH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1108">36</xref></sup> <small>ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD&#x003E;</small>. Then all Israel was appeased,<sup><xref rid="fn1109">37</xref></sup> when they knew that there was no &#x003C;authorization&#x003E; from David. So David ordered his son, Solomon, to kill him, because Joab was the son of David&#x2019;s sister, and he wanted him to approach the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1110">38</xref></sup> When Solomon desired to kill him, Joab said to Benaiah: Go and tell Solomon: Do not sentence me with two judgments. If you are killing me, take off from me the curses with which your father, David, cursed me; and if not, leave me with his curses. Immediately (in I Kings 2:31): <small>SO</small> [<small>THE KING</small>] <small>SAID TO HIM: DO AS HE HAS SPOKEN</small>. [<small>STRIKE HIM DOWN AND BURY HIM</small>.] R. Judah has said: All curses with which David cursed Joab were all fulfilled in David&#x2019;s seed. [(II Sam. 3:29:) <small>MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, ONE WHO GRASPS THE CRUTCH, ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD</small>.]<sup><xref rid="fn1111">39</xref></sup> <small>ONE WITH A DISCHARGE</small> &#x003C;was fulfilled in&#x003E; Rehoboam ben Solomon (according to I Kings 12:18 &#x003D; II Chron. 10:18): <small>THEN KING REHOBOAM SUCCEEDED IN MOUNTING HIS CHARIOT</small> (<italic>merkavah</italic>) <small>&#x003C;AND FLED TO JERUSALEM&#x003E;</small>. It also says concerning <small>ONE WITH A DISCHARGE</small> (in Lev. 15:9): <small>AND ANY SADDLE</small> (<italic>merkav</italic>) <small>ON WHICH THE ONE WITH A DISCHARGE RIDES &#x003C;SHALL BE UNCLEAN&#x003E;</small>. (II Sam 3:29, cont.:) <small>A LEPER</small> &#x003C;was fulfilled in&#x003E; Uzziah, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 15:5): <small>AND HE WAS A LEPER UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEATH</small>. (II Sam 3:29, cont.:) <small>ONE WHO GRASPS THE CRUTCH</small> &#x003C;was fulfilled in&#x003E; Asa, of whom it is written (in I Kings 15:23): <small>HOWEVER IN HIS OLD AGE HE BECAME DISEASED IN HIS FEET</small>, where gout<sup><xref rid="fn1112">40</xref></sup> had seized him. (II Sam 3:29, cont.:) <small>ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD</small> &#x003C;was fulfilled in&#x003E; Josiah, of whom it is written (in II Chron. 35:23): <small>THEN THE ARCHERS SHOT KING JOSIAH</small>. Moreover, Rav Judah has said: Rav said: they thrust three hundred iron lances<sup><xref rid="fn1113">41</xref></sup> into him, until they had perforated him like a sieve. (II Sam 3:29, cont.:) <small>AND ONE LACKING BREAD</small> &#x003C;was fulfilled in&#x003E; Jehoiachin, of whom it is stated (in II Kings 25:30 &#x003D; Jer. 52:34): <small>AND FOR HIS FOOD ALLOWANCE A REGULAR FOOD ALLOWANCE WAS GIVEN TO HIM FROM THE KING</small>, from the table of Evil-merodach. You also find that as long as Jehoiada lived, Joash did the will of his creator, as stated (in II Kings 12:3 [2] // II Chron. 24:2): <small>AND JEHOASH DID WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD ALL HIS DAYS AS THE PRIEST JEHOIADA INSTRUCTED HIM</small>. (II Chron. 24:17:) <small>NOW AFTER THE DEATH OF JEHOIADA, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH CAME</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO HIM</small>&#x007D; <small>AND BOWED LOW TO THE KING. THEN THE KING HEARKENED UNTO THEM</small>, in that he took it upon himself to make an idol. Therefore (According to vs. 24): <small>&#x003C;THE ARMY OF ARAM CAME WITH A FEW MEN&#x2026;.&#x003E; SO THEY INFLICTED JUDGMENTS ON JOASH</small>. Now for what was Abner punished. It was because he had made the blood of the young men an amusement (rt.: <italic><small>SHQ</small></italic>), as stated (in II Sam. 2:14): <small>THEN ABNER SAID UNTO JOAB: PLEASE LET THE YOUNG MEN ARISE AND PLAY</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SHQ</small></italic>) <small>BEFORE US. SO JOAB SAID: LET THEM ARISE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">42</xref></sup> There are also those who say it was because he put his name before the name of David, as stated (in II Sam. 3:12): <small>THEN ABNER SENT MESSENGERS UNTO DAVID WHERE HE WAS, SAYING: TO WHOM DOES THE LAND BELONG?</small> But the sages say: It was because he did not [wait] for Saul to be reconciled with David. Moreover, he had the power to protest &#x003C;the massacre&#x003E; at Nob, the city of priests, and did not protest.</p>
<title>10.10 Numbers 35:9ff, Part III</title>
<p>You find that Sennacherib exiled Israel in three exiles.<sup><xref rid="fn1115">43</xref></sup> First, he exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. Second, &#x003C;came&#x003E; the tribe of Zebulon and the tribe of Naphtali, as stated (in Is. 8:23 [9:1]): <small>IN THE FORMER TIME HE ABASED THE LAND OF ZEBULON AND THE LAND OF NAPHTALI</small>. Third, he exiled the rest of the tribes, as stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND LATER HE AFFLICTED &#x003C;THE WAY OF THE SEA, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN, GALILEE OF THE GENTILES&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1116">44</xref></sup> Nebuchadnezzar also carried out three exiles with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In the first he exiled Jehoiakim &#x003C;and&#x003E; in the second, Jehoiachin. What did he do? He bound him in his carriage<sup><xref rid="fn1117">45</xref></sup> and &#x003C;there&#x003E; he became dear to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1118">46</xref></sup> Thus it is stated: Behold, I am sending you away like a queen mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1119">47</xref></sup> Just as one honors the queen mother, so did Nebuzaradan act toward him. Then Nebuzaradan exiled Zedekiah, for a total of three exiles. The Holy one said: In this world Israel has gone into exile because of iniquities, but in the age to come (according to Deut. 30:4): <small>EVEN IF YOUR BANISHMENT IS TO THE END OF THE HEAVENS, FROM THERE WILL THE LORD YOUR GOD GATHER YOU, EVEN FROM THERE WILL HE BRING YOU BACK</small>. It also says (in Is. 11:12): <small>AND HE SHALL GATHER THE DISPERSED OF JUDAH&#x2026;</small>. And it says (in Is. 35:10): <small>AND THE RANSOMED OF THE LORD SHALL SHALL RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH SINGING. EVERLASTING JOY SHALL BE UPON THEIR HEADS, THEY SHALL OBTAIN JOY AND GLADNESS, WHILE SORROW AND SIGHING SHALL FLEE AWAY</small>. And it says (in Is. 51:3): <small>TRULY THE LORD HAS COMFORTED ZION; HE HAS COMFORTED ALL ITS RUINS. HE HAS ALSO MADE ITS DESERT LIKE EDEN AND ITS DRY PLAIN LIKE THE GARDEN OF THE LORD. JOY AND REJOICING SHALL BE FOUND IN IT, THANKSGIVING AND THE SOUND OF MUSIC</small>.</p>

<title>Chapter 1 Deuteronomy, Parashah I: <italic>Devarim</italic></title>
<title>1.1 Deuteronomy 1:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small> (<italic>elleh hadevarim</italic>). May the name &#x003C;of the Holy One&#x003E; be blessed and may his memory be exalted.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">1</xref></sup> All the miracles that he did for Israel in the wilderness, he is likewise going to do in Zion. It is written concerning the wilderness (ibid.): <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 42:16): <small>I WILL TURN DARKNESS BEFORE THEM INTO LIGHT AND ROUGH PLACES INTO LEVEL GROUND. THESE THINGS</small> (<italic>elleh hadevarim</italic>) [<small>I WILL DO, AND I WILL NOT FORSAKE THEM</small>]. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 20:15 [18]): <small>NOW ALL THE PEOPLE SAW THE THUNDERINGS</small> (<italic>qol</italic> in the plural); and it is written concerning Zion (in Jer. 7:34): <small>&#x003C;AND I WILL PUT AN END &#x2026; &#x003E; TO THE SOUND</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF JOY AND THE SOUND</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF GLADNESS, THE VOICE</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF THE BRIDEGROOM &#x003C;AND THE VOICE</small> (<italic>qol</italic>) <small>OF THE BRIDE&#x003E;</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH QUAKED</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6): <small>I WILL CAUSE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO QUAKE</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21): <small>AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL GO BEFORE YOU</small>. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE GLAD OVER YOU AGAIN</small>; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19): <small>I WILL ALSO REJOICE IN JERUSALEM AND BE GLAD IN MY PEOPLE</small>. [&#x003C;Also&#x003E; (according to Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>.] What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5 [3]): <small>I WILL MAKE HER LIKE A WILDERNESS</small> [<small>AND RENDER HER LIKE AN ARID LAND</small>]. For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS &#x003C;AND THE ARID LAND&#x003E; SHALL BE GLAD</small>. Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2:) <small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>HAS RECEIVED FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1121">2</xref></sup> So for that reason Isaiah has comforted her doubly (in vs. 1) <small>COMFORT, O COMFORT &#x003C;MY PEOPLE, SAYS YOUR GOD&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Similarly&#x003E; (in Is. 51:12): I, I <small>&#x003C;AM THE ONE WHO COMFORTS YOU&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Also&#x003E; (in Is. 51:9): <small>AWAKE, AWAKE, &#x003C;PUT ON STRENGTH, O ARM OF THE LORD&#x003E;</small>&#x0021; &#x003C;Also&#x003E; (in Is. 51:17): <small>ROUSE YOURSELF, ROUSE YOURSELF</small>&#x0021; <small>&#x003C;ARISE, O JERUSALEM</small> &#x2026; &#x0021;&#x003E; &#x003C;Also&#x003E; (in Is. 61:10): <small>I WILL BE GLAD WITH REJOICING &#x003C;IN THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Also&#x003E; (in Is. 35:1&#x2013;2) <small>&#x003C;THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD &#x2026;;&#x003E; IT SHALL BLOSSOM WITH BLOSSOMS</small>.</p>
<title>1.2 Deuteronomy 1:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another Interpretation (of Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>. For what reason was this written? To teach you that when the Holy One revealed his Divine Presence over Israel, he &#x007B;was not revealed &#x003C;in&#x003E;&#x007D; [did not reveal] all his bounty to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty; for if he had revealed his bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3 [4]): <small>FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THEY HAVE NOT HEARD, NOR HAS AN EAR PERCEIVED, NOR HAS AN EYE SEEN &#x003C;A GOD BESIDES YOU, WHO WORKS FOR THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HIM&#x003E;</small>. Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years, &#x003C;when&#x003E; Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3): <small>I AM</small> &#x007B;<small>YOUR BROTHER</small>&#x007D; <small>JOSEPH &#x2026;, HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM; FOR THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM</small>. How much the more &#x003C;would Israel have been dismayed&#x003E; at &#x003C;a sudden revelation of&#x003E; the Holy One&#x0021; What did the Holy One do for them instead? He revealed himself to them little by little. At the beginning, he made the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1): <small>THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD</small>. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THE STEPPES SHALL REJOICE. THEN AFTER THAT</small> (in vs. 2): <small>IT SHALL BLOOM ABUNDANTLY</small>. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THE GLORY OF LEBANON</small> &#x007B;<small>SHALL COME UNTO YOU</small>&#x007D; [<small>HAS BEEN GIVEN TO IT</small>]. Then after that (ibid.): <small>THEY SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE LORD, THE SPLENDOR OF OUR GOD</small>. For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17 [16]): <small>FOR THE LORD HAS BUILD UP ZION; HE HAS APPEARED IN HIS GLORY</small>. It also says (in Is. 52:8): <small>FOR EYE TO EYE THEY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF THE LORD TO ZION</small>. [Moreover, it says] (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US. THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.</p>

<p>(Deut. 2:2&#x2013;4:) <small>THEN THE LORD SPOKE UNTO ME, SAYING: YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT THIS HILL COUNTRY. &#x003C;TURN NORTH. &#x003E; NOW CHARGE THE PEOPLE, SAYING: &#x003C;YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF YOUR KINDRED, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU, WHO DWELL IN SEIR. THOUGH THEY WILL BE AFRAID OF YOU, YOU ARE TO BE VERY WARY</small>.&#x003E; This text is related (to Ps. 60:1): <small>TO THE DIRECTOR: ACCORDING TO SHUSHAN EDUTH; A MIKHTAM OF DAVID; FOR INSTRUCTION</small>. When? (According to vs. 2) <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM AND ARAM-ZOBAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">3</xref></sup> Now was it not already stated (in I Kings 11:15&#x2013;16): [<small>AND HE</small> (Joab) <small>SMOTE EVERY MALE IN EDOM</small>;] <small>FOR JOAB &#x003C;AND ALL ISRAEL&#x003E; STAYED THERE SIX MONTHS, &#x003C;UNTIL HE HAD ANNIHILATED EVERY MALE IN EDOM&#x003E;</small>? Still it says next (here in Ps. 60:2, cont.): <small>JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE &#x003C;TWELVE THOUSAND&#x003E; EDOMITES IN THE VALLEY OF SALT</small>. This text is related (to Is. 50:8): <small>MY VINDICATOR IS AT HAND. WHO WILL CONTEND WITH ME</small>? <small>LET US STAND TOGETHER&#x2026;</small>. The Holy One gave Torah to Israel, so that through it they would attain vindication before all peoples. You find that Joab was head of the Sanhedrin,<sup><xref rid="fn1123">4</xref></sup> as stated (in II Sam. 23:8) &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE WARRIORS WHOM DAVID HAD: ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">5</xref></sup> This was Joab; but David was wiser than all, since it is stated (in II Sam. 14:20 with reference to David): <small>MY LORD IS AS WISE</small> [<small>AS THE WISDOM OF AN ANGEL OF GOD</small>.] Still, they only acted on something in accord with the Sanhedrin, as stated (in Ps. 60:1): <small>TO THE DIRECTOR: ACCORDING TO SHUSHAN EDUTH</small> (i.e., <small>LILY OF WITNESS</small>); <small>A MIKHTAM OF DAVID. SHUSHAN EDUTH</small> refers to the Sanhedrin, since it is stated (in Cant. 7:3): <small>&#x003C;YOUR BELLY IS A HEAP OF WHEAT&#x003E; FENCED IN WITH THE LILIES</small> (<italic>shoshanim</italic>). <small>WITNESS</small> (<italic><small>EDUTH</small></italic>) &#x003C;is mentioned&#x003E; because of the Torah, which is called a witness.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">6</xref></sup> <small>MIKHTAM</small> refers to David, who made himself humble (<italic>Makh</italic>) and innocent (<italic>tam</italic>), because he walked in innocence with his Creator. When? (According to Ps. 60:2) <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM</small>. What does that mean? When Joab went to fight with <small>ARAM-NAHARAIM</small>, they came out toward him. They said to him: You are one of the children of Jacob, but we are from the children of Laban. Now here is their confirmed agreement, as written (in Gen. 31:52): <small>THIS MOUND IS A WITNESS, &#x003C;AND THE PILLAR</small><sup><xref rid="fn1126">7</xref></sup> <small>IS A WITNESS THAT I WILL NOT PASS BEYOND THIS MOUND AND THIS PILLAR UNTO YOU WITH EVIL INTENT&#x003E;</small>. When Joab heard &#x003C;that&#x003E;, he returned to David. He said to him: What do you say to that? Here is our ancestor Jacob&#x2019;s sworn agreement. They immediately convened a Sanhedrin, (in the words of Ps. 60:1) <small>A <italic>SHUSHAN EDUTH</italic></small> (i.e., <small>LILY OF WITNESS</small>) &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; [<small>FOR INSTRUCTION</small>]. They instructed him and said: It really was so, but they transgressed it first. Why did Balaam the Wicked transgress it? Does it not say so (in Numb. 23:7): <small>IT IS FROM ARAM THAT BALAK HAS BROUGHT ME, THE KING OF MOAB &#x003C;FROM THE HILLS OF THE EAST&#x003E;</small> &#x2026;? Moreover, did not Cushan-rishathaim (of Aram-naharaim) enslave us, as stated (in Jud. 3:8): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL SERVED CUSHAN-RISHATHAIM EIGHT YEARS</small>? &#x003C;Thus&#x003E; they have committed two wicked acts against us. When the court had so &#x007B;thanked&#x007D; [instructed] him, he immediately turned back against them and slew them, as stated (in Ps. 60:2): <small>WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM &#x003C;AND ARAM-ZOBAH, JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE EDOM, TWELVE THOUSAND, IN THE VALLEY OF SALT&#x003E;</small>. Did he not make war with Aram (i.e., Syria)? What is the meaning of <small>AND SMOTE EDOM</small>? It should have said &#x201C;Aram&#x201D; and not <small>EDOM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1127">8</xref></sup> It is simply that when Joab came to fight with Aram, the children of Edom stood up to him and said to him: Did not the Holy One say to you (in Deut. 2:5): <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE</small>? Joab answered them: Did he not say this to us (in vs. 4): <small>YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH THE TERRITORY OF YOUR KINDRED, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU</small>? Allow us to pass&#x0021; But they did not want to &#x003C;do so&#x003E;. Joab said to them: If we eradicate Edom now, we shall find nothing to eat or drink on our return. Instead let us leave them alone until we have smitten Aram, and then we shall turn back against them. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 60:2 [1]): <small>&#x003C;WHEN HE HAD STRUGGLED WITH ARAM-NAHARAIM &#x003C;AND ARAM-ZOBAH,&#x003E; JOAB RETURNED AND SMOTE EDOM, TWELVE THOUSAND, IN THE VALLEY OF SALT&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: You are to eradicate Edom little by little. When the time comes, I will destroy and eradicate it, as stated (in Obad. vs. 19): &#x007B;<small>HE SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE NEGEB AND THE MOUNTAIN</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE NEGEB SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MOUNTAIN OF</small>] <small>&#x003C;ESAU&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. It also says (in vs. 20): <small>AND THE EXILES IN THIS ARMY &#x003C;OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And it says (in vs. 21): <small>FOR SAVIORS SHALL GO UP ON MOUNT ZION TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU</small>. At that time (ibid., cont.): <small>THE KINGDOM SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>1.4 Deuteronomy 2:2ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:3:) <small>YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT THIS HILL COUNTRY</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 2:7&#x003D;3:5): <small>I ADJURE YOU, O DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM BY GAZELLES &#x003C;OR BY HINDS OF THE FIELD&#x003E;</small>. There are there three oaths<sup><xref rid="fn1128">9</xref></sup> in the book of Canticles.<sup><xref rid="fn1129">10</xref></sup> Why? One in which the Holy One adjured Israel not to reveal the end<sup><xref rid="fn1130">11</xref></sup>; &#x003C;a second&#x003E; that they would not force the end; &#x003C;a third&#x003E; that they would not rebel against the empires. The Holy One said to them: If you fulfill the oaths, fine; but if not, I will permit your flesh &#x003C;to be a prey&#x003E;, as with gazelles or hinds of the field, which no one claims or desires. Shall I not so claim your blood?</p>
<title>1.5 Deuteronomy 2:31ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:31:) <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD SAID</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO MOSES</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO ME</small>]: <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON AND HIS LAND OVER TO YOU</small>. [It is also written] (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITE</small><sup><xref rid="fn1131">12</xref></sup> [<small>BEFORE THEM, WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT</small>]. By virtue of what? By virtue of the Torah, which the sages had taught. Our masters have said: Sihon was strong.<sup><xref rid="fn1132">13</xref></sup> His height was like a wall tower, and he was stronger than all creatures. He was taller than any tower on earth, but his feet reached to the earth. So no creature was able to stand before him, just as it says (ibid., cont.): <small>YET I DESTROYED HIS FRUIT ABOVE &#x003C;AND HIS ROOTS BELOW&#x003E;</small>. What did the Holy One do? He bound the &#x003C;angelic&#x003E; prince that belonged to him and to his land. Then he cast him &#x007B;in&#x007D; [from] his place and handed him over to Israel. Our masters have said: Sihon and Og were stronger than Pharaoh and his armies; for just as they uttered a song over the fall of Pharaoh, so were they worthy to utter a song at their fall. It is simply that David came and uttered a song over them, as stated (in Ps. 136:10): <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE EGYPT THROUGH THEIR FIRST-BORN&#x2026;</small>. (vss. 17, 19) <small>TO THE ONE WHO SMOTE GREAT KINGS &#x2026;; SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES&#x2026;</small>.</p>

<p>according to Buber&#x2019;s fifth Oxford manuscript and according to his Sephardic manuscript.</p>
<p>These manuscripts are described by Buber on pp. 143&#x2013;147, 150 of his introduction.</p>
<title>1a.1 Deuteronomy 1:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT MOSES SPOKE</small>. This text is related (to Is. 35:6): <small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART, AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SHALL SHOUT FOR JOY</small>. Come and see.<sup><xref rid="fn1133">1</xref></sup> When the Holy One said to M<small>OSES</small> (in Exod. 3:10): <small>I WILL SEND YOU UNTO PHARAOH</small>, Moses said to him: You are doing me an injustice.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">2</xref></sup> (Exod. 4:10): <small>I AM NOT A MAN OF WORDS</small>. He said to him: Seventy languages are spoken in Pharaoh&#x2019;s palace.<sup><xref rid="fn1135">3</xref></sup> Thus if an embassy<sup><xref rid="fn1136">4</xref></sup> comes from another place, they may speak with them in their own language. When I go on your mission, they will examine me, asking whether I am a representative of the Omnipresent. Then it will be revealed to them that I do not know how to converse with them. Will they not laugh at me, saying: Look at the agent of the one who created the world and all its languages&#x0021; Does he not know how to listen and reply? See here, something is wrong&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1137">5</xref></sup> (Exod. 4:10:) <small>I AM NOT A MAN OF WORDS</small>. (Exod. 6:12:) &#x007B;<small>SEE</small>&#x007D; [<small>FOR</small>] <small>I HAVE UNCIRCUMCISED LIPS</small> (i.e., a speech impediment). The Holy One said to him: But look at the first Adam. Since no creature taught him, where did he &#x003C;come to&#x003E; know seventy languages? It is so stated: <small>AND HE RECITED NAMES FOR THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1138">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;A name for every beast&#x201D; is not written here but: <small>NAMES</small> (in the plural). [Who gave Adam a mouth that would recite names, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; a name for each and every &#x003C;beast&#x003E; in seventy languages?] The mouth that said (in Exod. 4:10): <small>I AM NOT A MAN OF WORDS</small>, &#x003C;then&#x003E; said (in Deut. 1:1): <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>. The prophet also cries out and says (in Is. 35:6): <small>THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART, AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SHALL SHOUT FOR JOY</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE WATERS SHALL BREAK FORTH IN THE WILDERNESS AND STREAMS IN THE DESERT</small>. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 1:1): <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>.</p>
<title>1a.2 Deuteronomy 1:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS THAT MOSES SPOKE</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 28:23): <small>THE ONE WHO REBUKES A PERSON WILL IN THE END FIND MORE FAVOR THAN THE ONE WITH A FLATTERING TONGUE. THE ONE WHO REBUKES A PERSON</small> is Moses, since he rebuked Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1139">7</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>WILL IN THE END FIND MORE FAVOR</small> &#x003C;also refers to Moses&#x003E;, since he found favor and good insight in the eyes of God and humanity. Thus it is stated (in Exod. 34:9): <small>PLEASE, IF I HAVE FOUND FAVOR IN YOUR EYES, O LORD</small>. (Prov. 28:23:) <small>THE ONE WITH A FLATTERING TONGUE</small> refers to Balaam, since he said to Israel (in Numb. 24:5): <small>HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR TENTS, O JACOB; YOUR TABERNACLES, O ISRAEL</small>. To what were they comparable? To a king&#x2019;s son, who had two guardians.<sup><xref rid="fn1140">8</xref></sup> One loved him and the other hated him. The one who loved him warned him and said: My son, watch yourself, lest you make a transgression, since your father is judge; and if he hears that you have committed a transgression, even though he is your father, he will not show partiality to you. But the one who hated him said to him: Why are you depressed? Your father is king&#x0021; Do as you desire. Be afraid of no mortal, for your father will not be upset with you. Similarly the son is Israel. The two guardians are Moses and Balaam. Moses loved them and said to them (in Deut. 11:16&#x2013;17): <small>TAKE HEED LEST YOUR HEART BE DECEIVED &#x2026;; FOR THE ANGER OF THE LORD WILL BE KINDLED AGAINST YOU</small>. Why? Because he is judge, as stated (in Deut. 4:39): <small>SO KNOW THIS DAY AND TAKE TO HEART THAT THE LORD IS GOD</small>. Balaam, however, said: Do not be afraid. You are his children. Do whatever you want, for he will not be upset with you. To all the nations he does whatever he decrees over them. Why? (Numb. 23:19:) <small>GOD IS NOT A HUMAN, THAT HE SHOULD SPEAK FALSEHOOD</small>. But in your case he said (ibid., cont.): <small>HAS HE GIVEN HIS WORD WITHOUT ACTING &#x003C;ON IT&#x003E;</small>? <small>AND HAS HE SPOKEN &#x003C;SOMETHING&#x003E; WITHOUT FULFILLING IT</small>? On this point Solomon cries out and says (in Prov. 27:6): <small>THE WOUNDS OF A LOVED ONE ARE FOUND TO BE TRUSTWORTHY</small>. This refers to Moses. (Ibid., cont.): <small>AND THE KISSES OF AN ENEMY ARE PROFUSE</small>. This refers to Balaam. (Deut. 1:1:) <small>THESE ARE THE WORDS</small>.</p>
<title>1a.3 Deuteronomy 2:2ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:3:) <small>YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT THIS HILL COUNTRY</small>. This text is related (to Cant. 2:7): <small>I ADJURE YOU, O DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM &#x003C;BY GAZELLES OR BY HINDS OF THE FIELD&#x003E;</small>. R. Levi said: I ADJURE YOU is written four times (in Cant. 2:7; 3:5; 5:8; and 8:4). And why? &#x003C;The usage&#x003E; corresponds to four empires, against none of which they should revolt.<sup><xref rid="fn1141">9</xref></sup> R. Helbo said: &#x003C;The usage&#x003E; corresponds to four things &#x003C;they should not do&#x003E;: They should not force the end; when they come up from exile, they should not come home in huge mobs; they should not revolt against the empire; and they should not reveal their mysteries<sup><xref rid="fn1142">10</xref></sup> (i.e., Oral Torah). And for that reason &#x003C;Solomon&#x003E; adjured them four times. [(Cant. 2:7, cont.:) <small>O DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>O DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM</small>? &#x003C;Solomon&#x003E; calls the nations <small>DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM</small>. R. Johanan said: The Holy One is going to make Jerusalem a metropolis<sup><xref rid="fn1143">11</xref></sup> for the whole world, since it is stated (in Ezek. 16:61): <small>AND I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU AS DAUGHTERS, THOUGH THEY ARE NOT OF YOUR COVENANT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">12</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <small>THOUGH THEY ARE NOT OF YOUR COVENANT</small>? Though &#x003C;such a one&#x003E; is neither of your mother&#x2019;s dowry, nor of your father&#x2019;s trade<sup><xref rid="fn1145">13</xref></sup>; nor is it that you have kinship with such a one. What is the meaning of <small>DAUGHTERS</small>? &#x003C;It is used&#x003E; as (in Josh. 15:45): <small>EKRON ALONG WITH ITS DAUGHTERS</small> &#x007B;as it were&#x007D; <small>AND COURTS</small> (i.e., with its suburbs). So for that reason &#x003C;Solomon&#x003E; calls them <small>DAUGHTERS OF JERUSALEM</small>. (Cant. 2:7, cont.:) <small>BY GAZELLES</small>. What is the meaning of <small>BY GAZELLES</small> (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>B</small>&#x2019;<small>WT</small></italic>)? By a heavenly host(<italic><small>T</small>s<small>B</small></italic>&#x2019;). Another interpretation: By your circumcision, which is his desire (<italic><small>T</small>s<small>BYWN</small></italic>, i.e., gazelle [<italic><small>T</small>s<small>BYH</small></italic>]). Another interpretation: By the fathers, the mothers, and the tribes, which are likened to a deer. (Cant. 2:7, cont.:) <small>OR BY HINDS OF THE FIELD</small>. These are the tribes, which were likened to a hind where it is stated (in Gen. 49:21): <small>NAPHTALI IS A HIND LET LOOSE</small>.</p>
<title>1a.4 Deuteronomy 2:2ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:3:) <small>YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 37:7): <small>BE SILENTLY ATTENTIVE TO THE LORD, AND WAIT PATIENTLY</small> (<italic>hitholel,</italic> as if from <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>) <small>FOR HIM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TO THE LORD</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1146">14</xref></sup> Accept the judgment upon yourselves; yes, even if you become slain (rt.: <italic><small>HLL</small></italic>) for the name of the Holy One, just as it is stated (in Job 13:15): &#x007B;<small>&#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; IF HE SLAYS ME</small>,&#x007D; [<small>HE MAY WELL SLAY ME</small>;] <small>I WILL WAIT FOR HIM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 2:3:) <small>YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF GOING ABOUT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>SBB</small></italic>) <small>THIS HILL COUNTRY</small> (<italic>hahar</italic>). &#x003C;These words can and should mean:&#x003E; He had his father (<italic>hahar</italic> understood as <italic>horeh</italic>) sit down to eat (rt.: <italic><small>SBB</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1148">16</xref></sup> Esau greatly honored his father Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn1149">17</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said: Esau honored &#x003C;him&#x003E; as I have been unable to honor my father. When I came to my<sup><xref rid="fn1150">18</xref></sup> father to serve him, I did not wear fine clothes, but Esau did not perform in the clothes which he wore outside, when he served his father. What did he do? He took off the garments in which he served and put on fine clothes. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:15): <small>THEN REBEKAH TOOK THE BEST GARMENTS OF HER OLDER SON ESAU, WHICH WERE WITH HER IN THE HOUSE</small>. Ergo, he honored his father (<italic>horo</italic>) greatly. After I (i.e., the Holy One) repay (<italic>pore</italic>&#x2018;) him for honoring his parents, I will exact vengeance (<italic>pore</italic>&#x2018;) from him. Thus it is stated (in Zech. 3:12 [8]): [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS AFTER HIS GLORY SENT ME UNTO THE NATIONS THAT PLUNDERED YOU</small>. But now (as stated in Deut. 2:3): <small>YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH</small>.</p>
<title>1a.5 Deuteronomy 2:2ff, Part III</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 2:3): <small>&#x003C;YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF&#x003E; GOING ABOUT THIS MOUNTAIN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">19</xref></sup> What does it signify regarding the Temple, of which it is written (in Ps. 48:3 [2]): <small>MOUNT ZION FAR IN THE NORTH</small>? Is it not enough for you that you do not accept his mountain? Rather he enters your mountain and destroys it. (Deut. 2:3, cont.:) <small>TURN NORTH</small>. Prepare yourselves for the empires, because they are coming upon you, as stated (in Jer. 1:15): <small>FOR BEHOLD, I AM CALLING ALL THE KINGDOMS OF THE NORTH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1152">20</xref></sup> (Deut. 2:4:) <small>COMMAND THE PEOPLE, SAYING</small>. &#x003C;These words are&#x003E; to teach the generations coming after you that they charge each other to be wary of Esau.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 2:4:) <small>YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH &#x003C;THE BORDERS OF YOUR KINFOLK, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU, THE INHABITANTS OF SEIR&#x003E;</small>. It is a good sign<sup><xref rid="fn1154">22</xref></sup> for them that you are passing through. Why? When it comes to divine retribution, it only comes upon the inhabitants. It is so stated (in Is. 24:17): <small>TERROR, THE PIT, AND THE SNARE ARE UPON YOU, O INHABITANT OF THE LAND</small>&#x0021;</p>
<p>(Deut. 2:4:) <small>YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH THE BORDERS OF YOUR KINFOLK, THE CHILDREN OF ESAU, &#x003C;THE INHABITANTS OF SEIR&#x003E;</small>; and the prophet cries out (in Obad. vs. 7): <small>ALL YOUR ALLIES HAVE DRIVEN YOU TO THE BORDER</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 2:4, cont.:) <small>THEY WILL BE AFRAID OF YOU, BUT BE VERY CAREFUL</small>. Even though they are afraid of you, <small>BE VERY CAREFUL</small>. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel has said: When they are afraid of you, &#x003C;Scripture&#x003E; has said to us, <small>BE VERY CAREFUL</small>. How much the more &#x003C;must&#x003E; we &#x003C;be careful&#x003E;, when absorbed among them.</p>
<title>1a.6 Deuteronomy 2:2ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:5:) <small>DO NOT ENGAGE THEM IN BATTLE, FOR I WILL NOT GIVE YOU ENOUGH OF THEIR LAND FOR</small> (&#x2018;<italic>ad</italic>) <small>&#x003C;EVEN&#x003E; THE SOLE OF A FOOT TO TREAD</small> (rt.: <italic><small>DRK</small></italic>) <small>ON</small>. R. Meir says: Until (&#x2018;<italic>ad</italic>) his (the Holy One&#x2019;s) feet stand on that day (upon the Mount of Olives).<sup><xref rid="fn1155">23</xref></sup> R. Samuel says: Until (&#x2018;<italic>ad</italic>) that one comes of whom it is written (in Numb. 24:17): <small>A STAR SHALL COME</small> (<italic><small>DRK</small></italic>) <small>OUT OF JACOB</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1156">24</xref></sup> This refers to the messianic King. The Holy One said to them: In this world you have no property on this mountain, but in the world to come you shall be redeemed. Then you shall claim it and take possession of it.<sup><xref rid="fn1157">25</xref></sup> It is so stated (in Obad. vs. 19): <small>THE NEGEB SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU</small>. It is also written (in vs. 21): <small>FOR SAVIORS SHALL GO UP ON MOUNT ZION TO JUDGE THE MOUNTAIN OF ESAU, AND THE KINGDOM SHALL BELONG TO THE LORD</small>.</p>
<title>1a.7 Deuteronomy 2:31ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE SIHON AND HIS LAND OVER TO YOU. BEGIN &#x003C;TO TAKE&#x003E; POSSESSION &#x003C;OF HIS LAND&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITE</small><sup><xref rid="fn1158">26</xref></sup> <small>BEFORE YOU</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1159">27</xref></sup> <small>WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT AND WHO WAS AS STRONG AS THE OAKS</small>. R. Johanan said:<sup><xref rid="fn1160">28</xref></sup> Sihon&#x2019;s thighbone was eighteen cubits according to the cubits of the children of his generation.<sup><xref rid="fn1161">29</xref></sup> (Deut. 3:1:) <small>AND OG, KING OF BASHAN</small>. Abba Saul says: I used to bury the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">30</xref></sup> One time I ran after a deer and entered within the thighbone of a corpse. Moreover, I ran after it for three parasangs,<sup><xref rid="fn1163">31</xref></sup> without reaching the deer and without the thighbone ending. I asked: Who is he? And they said to me: This is the thighbone of Og, King of Bashan.</p>
<p>When Hadrian the Wicked conquered Jerusalem, he took pride in saying: I conquered Jerusalem by force. R. Johanan ben Zakkai said to him: Do not take pride &#x003C;in this&#x003E;. If it had not been &#x003C;ordained&#x003E; from the heavens, you would not have conquered. What did Rabban Johanan do? He took him and brought him into the &#x003C;Amorite&#x003E; cave. There he showed him &#x003C;where&#x003E; the Amorites &#x003C;lay&#x003E; buried, and one of them was eighteen cubits long. He said to him: When we had virtue, all these fell at our hands, but now because of our sins, you have prevailed against us. So Scripture says (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITE BEFORE YOU</small>. By virtue of what? By virtue of the Torah, which you accepted &#x003C;and&#x003E; which begins (in Exod. 20:2): I (<italic>anokhi</italic>) <small>AM THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>. It is through the word <italic>anokhi</italic> (in Amos 2:9): I (<italic>anokhi</italic>) <small>DESTROYED THE AMORITE BEFORE YOU</small>.</p>
<title>1a.8 Deuteronomy 2:31ff, Part II</title>
<p>Our masters have taught: Sihon was as strong as a wall tower.<sup><xref rid="fn1164">32</xref></sup> When he sat on the wall his feet reached to the ground, and there was no creature on earth able to stand against him. So what did the Holy One do? He bound his guardian angel (<italic><small>SRW SL M</small>&#x2018;<small>LH</small></italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>), cast him down, and deliverered him into the hand of Moses. It is so stated (with reference to the Amorite in Amos 2:9, cont.): <small>I DESTROYED HIS FRUIT ABOVE</small> (<italic><small>MM</small>&#x2018;<small>L</small></italic>, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>LH</small></italic>) <small>AND HIS ROOTS BELOW</small>, i.e., his seed. Why? Because the Holy One foresaw his children and his children&#x2019;s children up to the resurrection that not one of them would fear Heaven, he immediately cut off his seed. But how did the Amorites die? Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One prepared two hornets for each and every one of them, as stated (in a literal translation of Deut. 7:20): <small>MOREOVER, THE LORD</small> [<small>YOUR</small>] <small>GOD WILL SEND THE HORNET AMONG THEM</small>. Now the hornet flies and smites one in the midst of his eye. Then immediately his eye drops out and he dies. And this is what David said (in Ps. 44:4 [3]): <small>FOR THEY DID NOT TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND WITH THEIR OWN SWORD, NOR DID THEIR MIGHTY ARM DELIVER THEM&#x2026;</small>. If you had not helped them they would not have overcome them. So for that reason, when Moses saw them, he was afraid of them, until the Holy One said to him: Do not be afraid of them. The sages have said: Sihon and Og were stronger than Pharaoh and his armies; for just as they uttered a song over the fall of Pharaoh and his army, so were they worthy to utter &#x003C;a song&#x003E; over Sihon and Og. It is simply that David came and uttered a song over them (in Ps. 136:19&#x2013;20): <small>SIHON, KING OF THE AMORITES, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER; AND OG, KING OF BASHAN, FOR HIS STEADFAST LOVE ENDURES FOREVER</small>.</p>
<title>1a.9 Deuteronomy 2:31ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE &#x003C;SIHON AND HIS LAND&#x003E; OVER TO YOU</small> (in the singular). He did not say: &#x201C;To you (in the plural),&#x201D; but <small>TO YOU</small> (in the singular), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; because of you (in the singular). Now it was not because Israel possessed good works that I handed them over, but because of you. Moses said: You are sending an Angel. I have no need for him, (in the words of Exod. 33:15) <small>IF YOUR PRESENCE DOES NOT GO ALONG</small>. The Holy One said: Is it because of the angel that you are making a complaint? By your life, it shall not be an angel but a single hornet that I will send, and it shall finish them; for so it says (in Josh. 24:12): <small>I SENT THE HORNET BEFORE YOU, &#x003C;WHICH DROVE OUT THOSE TWO KINGS OF THE AMORITES FROM BEFORE YOU&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>1a.10 Deuteronomy 2:31ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 2:31): <small>SEE I HAVE BEGUN TO GIVE &#x003C;SIHON AND HIS LAND&#x003E; OVER TO YOU</small>. What is written there (in Deut. 2:24)? <small>&#x003C;SEE, I HAVE GIVEN SIHON, THE AMORITE KING OF HESHBON, INTO YOUR HAND ALONG WITH HIS LAND. BEGIN TO TAKE POSSESSION,&#x003E; AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>. But they did not do so. Rather (we read in vs. 26:) <small>THEN I SENT MESSENGERS &#x003C;FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH UNTO KING SIHON OF HESHBON WITH WORDS OF PEACE&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: I said: <small>AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>, but you are talking of peace. (Is. 48:22:) <small>THERE IS NO PEACE, SAYS THE LORD, FOR THE WICKED</small>. See, the words of peace are so great that Israel nullified what he had told them (in Deut. 2:24): <small>AND ENGAGE HIM IN BATTLE</small>. Still he was not angry with them.</p>
<p>[(Deut. 2:26:) <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small>.] What is the meaning of <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QDM</small></italic>)? Moses said to him: From you I learned that you existed before (rt.: <italic><small>QDM</small></italic>) the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">33</xref></sup> You could have sent a single bolt of lightning to burn Egypt, but you did not do so. Rather you sent me to Pharaoh, as stated (in Exod. 5:1): <small>LET MY PEOPLE GO</small>. Ergo <small>KEDEMOTH</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 2:26): <small>FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH</small>. From the Torah I learned that it existed before (rt.: <italic><small>QDM</small></italic>) everything. When you came to give it, it was revealed to you that the children of Esau and the children of Keturah would not accept it. But nevertheless you persevered and demanded it for them so that they would accept it. Therefore (in Deut. 2:26): <small>I SENT MESSENGERS &#x003C;FROM THE DESERT OF KEDEMOTH&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said: You are asking peace. By your life you shall take possession of their land in peace, as stated (in Ps. 37:11): <small>BUT THE MEEK SHALL TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LAND AND TAKE DELIGHT IN ABUNDANT PEACE</small>.</p>

<title>2.1 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 3:23:) <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD&#x2026;.</small> This text is related (to Job 9:22): <small>IT IS ALL ONE; THEREFORE, I SAY: HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the World, everything is equal before you.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">1</xref></sup> There is one determination for the righteous and for the wicked. Similarly also Solomon says (in Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &#x003C;HAPPENS&#x003E; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &#x003C;FALLS&#x003E; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED, TO THE GOOD, TO THE CLEAN AND TO THE UNCLEAN, TO THE ONE WHO SACRIFICES AND TO THE ONE WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE. AS IT IS WITH THE GOOD, SO IT IS THE SINNER; THE ONE WHO TAKES AN OATH IS LIKE ONE WHO FEARS AN OATH</small>. (Eccl. 9:2:) <small>TO THE RIGHTEOUS</small> refers to Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">2</xref></sup> R. Pinhas &#x003C;said&#x003E; in the name of R. Johanan, &#x003C;who spoke&#x003E; in the name of R. Eleazar the son of R. Jose the Galilean: When Noah came out of the ark, the lion bit him and maimed him so that he became unfit to offer sacrifice; so his son Shem offered sacrifice in his place.<sup><xref rid="fn1168">3</xref></sup> (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND TO THE WICKED</small> refers to Pharaoh Necho. When he wanted to sit on Solomon&#x2019;s throne &#x003C;and&#x003E; did not know its mechanism,<sup><xref rid="fn1169">4</xref></sup> a lion which was on the throne<sup><xref rid="fn1170">5</xref></sup> bit him and maimed him. The former died with a limp, and the latter died with a limp. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>TO THE GOOD</small> refers to Moses, as stated (in Exod. 2:2): <small>AND WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE WAS GOOD</small>, in that he was born circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn1171">6</xref></sup> (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>TO THE CLEAN</small> refers to Aaron, who would cleanse the sins of Israel. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND TO THE UNCLEAN</small> refers to the spies. The one group (i.e., the spies) uttered slander against the land of Israel, while the other (i.e., Moses and Aaron) uttered praise for the land of Israel; &#x003C;still&#x003E; the former did not enter &#x003C;the land&#x003E;, nor did the latter enter it. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>TO THE ONE WHO SACRIFICES</small> refers to Josiah, as stated (in II Chron. 35:7): <small>THEN JOSIAH DONATED TO THE LAY PEOPLE A FLOCK OF LAMBS &#x003C;AND KIDS, ALL FOR PASSOVER SACRIFICES&#x003E;</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AND TO THE ONE WHO DOES NOT SACRIFICE</small> refers to Ahab, who abolished the sacrifices from upon the altar, since this is what is written (in II Chron. 18:2): <small>WHERE AHAB SLAUGHTERED SHEEP AND CATTLE FOR HIM &#x003C;IN ABUNDANCE&#x003E;</small>, (ibid.:) <small>FOR HIM</small> (i.e., for Jehoshaphat) as a feast and not for sacrificial offerings. &#x003C;Nevertheless&#x003E; the former died by arrows, as written (in II Chron. 35:23): <small>THEN THE ARCHERS SHOT KING JOSIAH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1172">7</xref></sup> and the latter died by arrows, as written (in I Kings 22:34 &#x003D; II Chron. 18:33): <small>BUT A CERTAIN MAN DREW HIS BOW AT RANDOM &#x003C;AND STRUCK THE KING OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>AS IT IS FOR THE GOOD</small> refers to David, of whom it is stated (in I Sam. 16:12): <small>WITH BEAUTIFUL EYES AND A GOOD APPEARANCE</small>. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>SO IT IS THE SINNER</small> refers to Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is written (in Dan. 4:24 [27]): <small>ATONE FOR YOUR SINNING THROUGH RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. The former built the Temple and reigned forty years. The latter destroyed the Temple and reigned forty years. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>THE ONE WHO TAKES AN OATH</small> (without keeping it) refers to Zedekiah, of whom it is written (in II Chron. 36:13): <small>AND HE ALSO REBELLED AGAINST NEBUCHADNEZZAR WHO HAD MADE HIM TAKE AN OATH BY GOD</small>. What was his rebellion?<sup><xref rid="fn1173">8</xref></sup> Zedekiah discovered Nebuchadnezzar as he was actually eating a live rabbit. Nebuchadnezzar said to Zedekiah: Swear to me that you will not reveal it. He swore to him. In the end he was inwardly sorry. He had his oath absolved and told the five kings who had allowed Nebuchadnezzar to rule over them. When the other kings heard &#x003C;what he did&#x003E;, they despised him. Moreover they were saying against him: Should this man be ruling the earth, when he eats live rabbit&#x0021; When Nebuchadnezzar heard &#x003C;what they were saying&#x003E;, he sent to have the Sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1174">9</xref></sup> and Zedekiah come to him. He said to them: Have you seen what Zedekiah has done to me? &#x003C;Zedekiah&#x003E; said to them: I had my oath absolved. He (Nebuchadnezzar) said to the Sanhedrin: Who absolved the oath? They said to him: One absolves &#x003C;an oath, if there is&#x003E; danger to one&#x2019;s life. He said to them: When? They said to him: On the same day. &#x003C;He said to them:&#x003E; in the presence of him &#x003C;to whom the oath was sworn&#x003E; or not in his presence? They said to him: In his presence. &#x003C;He replied:&#x003E; But what was the reason for not saying so to Zedekiah? Immediately (in the words of Lam. 2:10): <small>THE ELDERS OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ZION SIT ON THE GROUND AND SILENCE</small>. R. Isaac said: &#x003C;This teaches that&#x003E; they removed the pillows and cushions from beneath them. (Eccl. 9:2, cont.:) <small>LIKE ONE WHO FEARS AN OATH</small>. This refers to Samson, &#x007B;since it says (in Jud. 15:12):&#x007D; [<small>THEN SAMSON SAID</small>] <small>TO THEM. SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU YOURSELVES WILL NOT ATTACK ME</small>. From here &#x003C;we know&#x003E; that he feared an oath. The former died with his eyes gouged out, and the latter died with his eyes gouged out. [The latter died with his eyes gouged out] according to what is stated (in II Kings 25:7 &#x003D; Jer. 39:7 &#x003D; Jer. 52:11): <small>THEN HE PUT OUT ZEDEKIAH&#x2019;S EYES</small>. This was one of seven who were like the first Adam &#x003C;in one feature&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1175">10</xref></sup> &#x003C;In the case of&#x003E; Zedekiah &#x003C;it was&#x003E; because of his eyes. So for they thrust iron lances<sup><xref rid="fn1176">11</xref></sup> into his eyes, but his eyes were not put out until they slaughtered his children before his eyes. It is so stated (in Jer. 39:6 &#x003D; Jer. 52:10 // II Kings 25:7): <small>AND THE KING OF BABYLON SLAUGHTERED &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ZEDEKIAH BEFORE HIS EYES</small> (<small>AT RIBLAH</small>)&#x003E;. Samson also [died with his eyes gouged out, as stated (in Jud. 16:21):] <small>SO THE PHILISTINES SEIZED HIM AND GOUGED OUT HIS EYES</small>.</p>

<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &#x003C;HAPPENS&#x003E; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &#x003C;FALLS&#x003E; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED</small>. Moses said [to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe,] everything is the same for you; (according to Job 9:22) &#x007B;<small>YOU DESTROY</small>&#x007D; [<small>HE DESTROYS</small>] <small>THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>. The spies provoked you with anger by slandering the land, while I have served your children forty years in the wilderness. Is the same lot [in store] for me as for them? A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who wanted to take a wife. He sent emissaries<sup><xref rid="fn1177">12</xref></sup> to see whether she was beautiful or not. They went to see her. &#x003C;Then&#x003E; they came &#x003C;back&#x003E; and said to him: We have seen her and there is no one more desolate and ugly than she. When her sponsor heard, he said: My Lord, there is no one in the world more beautiful than she. He came to take her. The father of the young woman said to the king&#x2019;s emissaries: I swear that none of you shall come to &#x003C;the wedding feast&#x003E;, seeing that you humiliated her before the king. When the sponsor came to enter, he said to him: You also may not come in. The sponsor said to him: Did I not see her and tell the king that there was no one more beautiful than she, while those said: There is no one more ugly than she? And now I shall see whether &#x003C;she is&#x003E; like my report or like their report. Similarly Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, the spies uttered slander, &#x003C;in describing the land (in Numb. 13:32) as&#x003E; <small>A LAND THAT EATS UP ITS INHABITANTS</small>. I, however, have not seen it, but I have praised it before your children (in Deut. 8:7): <small>FOR THE LORD YOUR GOD IS BRINGING YOU UNTO A GOOD LAND&#x2026;</small>. And now I shall see whether &#x003C;it is&#x003E; like my report or like their report. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:25): <small>PLEASE LET ME CROSS OVER AND SEE THE GOOD LAND</small>. He said to him (in Deut. 3:27): <small>&#x003C;GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH &#x2026;,&#x003E; FOR YOU SHALL NOT CROSS OVER &#x003C;THIS JORDAN&#x003E;</small>. He said to him: If so, everything is the same for you. (In accordance with Job 9:22) <small>HE DESTROYS THE INNOCENT AND THE WICKED</small>.</p>
<title>2.3 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 3:23:) <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD</small>. This text is related (to I Kings 8:30 // II Chron. 6:21): <small>AND YOU SHALL HARKEN UNTO THE</small> &#x007B;<small>PRAYER</small>&#x007D; [<small>SUPPLICATION</small>] <small>OF YOUR SERVANT</small>. Prayer is designated by many names.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">13</xref></sup> (1) Prayer, (2) beseeching, (3) call, (4) cry, (5) outcry, (6) chant, (7) supplication, (8) wailing, (9) calling, (10) plea, (11) Amidah,<sup><xref rid="fn1179">14</xref></sup> (12) entreaty. Why did Moses only pray under the word, &#x201C;beseeching (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>)&#x201D;? &#x003C;This is the usage here&#x003E; where it is stated (in Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>) <small>THE LORD</small>. It is simply that when Moses stood there and said to the Holy One (in Exod. 33:18): <small>PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR GLORY</small>, he said to him: Sovereign of the World, please show me by what principle you run your world. The Holy One said to him: I will show you. (Exod. 33:19:) <small>AND HE SAID: I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS</small> [<small>BEFORE YOU</small>]. The Holy One said to him: I have no obligation to &#x003C;any&#x003E; creature, but I am giving you &#x003C;this&#x003E; as a favor (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>). Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.:) <small>I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>) <small>TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS</small>. [Moses said to him: If so, do me a kindness, and grant it to me as a favor (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>). Ergo (in Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD</small>.]</p>
<title>2.4 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 3:23): <small>I BESOUGHT &#x003C;THE LORD&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Is. 30:19): <small>INDEED, O PEOPLE IN ZION, INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM</small>, [<small>YOU SHALL SURELY WEEP NO MORE. &#x003C;HE WILL SURELY SHOW YOU COMPASSION</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HNN</small></italic>)&#x003E;&#x2026;. ] What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 3:12)?<sup><xref rid="fn1180">15</xref></sup> &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E; <small>AND ITS CITIES I GAVE</small> &#x007B;<small>TO THE CHILDREN OF REUBEN AND TO THE CHILDREN OF GAD</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO THE REUBENITES AND TO THE GADITES</small>]. Moses taught &#x003C;all&#x003E; who come into the world that one should not say that, whereas he is dangerously ill, has made a will,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">16</xref></sup> and divided all that he has. He should not say that, whereas he has made a will, he will no longer pray. Rather he should pray, because the Holy One does not disqualify the prayer of [any] creature. See here. Moses made a will, as stated (in Deut. 23:12): &#x003C; &#x2026; &#x003E; <small>AND ITS CITIES I GAVE TO THE REUBENITES AND TO THE GADITES</small> [&#x2026;.: (vs. 14:) <small>JAIR BEN MANASSEH &#x003C;RECEIVED&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> (vs. 15:)<small>TO MACHIR I GAVE GILEAD</small>. (vs. 16:) <small>AND TO THE REUBENITES AND THE GADITES I GAVE</small> [&#x2026;.: (vs. 18:) <small>THEN I CHARGED YOU AT THAT TIME, SAYING</small> [&#x2026;.] (vs. 21:) <small>I ALSO CHARGED JOSHUA</small> [<small>AT THAT TIME</small>], <small>SAYING</small>: [Ergo, &#x003C;Moses made&#x003E; a will. Lest you say: He ceased and did not pray, the text reads (in vs. 23) <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD</small>.]</p>
<title>2.5 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Deut. 3:23:) <small>I BESOUGHT THE LORD</small>. For what? That he should enter the land. This text is related (to Ps. 61:2 [1]): <small>HEAR</small> &#x007B;<small>A JUST CAUSE</small>&#x007D;[<small>MY SONG OF PRAYER</small>],<sup><xref rid="fn1182">17</xref></sup> <small>O GOD</small>. He said to him: What do you want. He said to him (in vs. 3) <small>FROM THE END OF THE EARTH I CALL UNTO YOU WHEN MY HEART IS FAINT. &#x003C;LEAD ME TO A ROCK THAT IS HIGHER THAN I.&#x003E;</small> The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; <small>DO NOT &#x003C;EVER SPEAK UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&#x003E; AGAIN</small>. [Moses said to him:] Sovereign of the World, you addressed me as <small>MY SERVANT MOSES</small> (in Numb. 12:7): <small>NOT SO WITH MY SERVANT</small> (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>) <small>MOSES</small>. I am a servant (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>), and Leviathan is a servant (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>). I act the suppliant before you, and he acts the suppliant before you, as stated (in Job 40:27 [41:3]): <small>WILL HE MAKE MANY SUPPLICATIONS UNTO YOU</small>? The supplication of Leviathan you hear, for you have made a covenant with him and sustain him, as stated (in Job 40:28 [41:4]): <small>WILL HE MAKE A COVENANT WITH YOU FOR YOU TO TAKE HIM AS YOUR SERVANT</small> (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>) <small>FOREVER</small>? Now I am your servant (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>), you have said to me (in Exod. 34:10): <small>I HEREBY MAKE A COVENANT</small>. But you have not carried it out. Instead you have said to me (in Deut. 32:50): <small>AND YOU SHALL DIE ON THE MOUNTAIN &#x003C;THAT YOU ARE ASCENDING&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And not only that, but you have written in the Torah and said (in Exod. 21:5&#x2013;6): <small>BUT IF THE SLAVE</small> (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>) <small>SAYS: I LOVE MY MASTER, &#x003C;MY WIFE, AND MY CHILDREN&#x003E;; I WILL NOT GO AWAY A FREE PERSON. THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM BEFORE GOD, AND HE SHALL BRING HIM UNTO THE DOOR OR UNTO THE DOORPOST, WHERE HIS MASTER SHALL PIERCE HIS EAR WITH AN AWL, AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOREVER</small>. &#x003E; Now I love you and I love your children; (in accord with Exod. 21:5) <small>I WILL NOT GO AWAY A FREE PERSON</small>. I do not want to die. (Exod. 21:6:) <small>THEN HIS MASTER SHALL BRING HIM BEFORE GOD &#x2026;, AND HE SHALL SERVE HIM FOREVER</small>. But you have not carried it out with me. So now please, (Ps. 61:2 [1]:) <small>HEAR MY SONG OF PRAYER, O GOD</small>. (Ps. 55:2 [1]:) <small>DO NOT HIDE YOURSELF FROM MY BESEECHING</small>. The Holy One said to me: Impossible&#x0021; (Deut. 3:26:) <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; The litigant against you (Satan) has already made a decision over you that you and all creatures like you are to die.</p>
<p>When the first Adam ate from the tree, he caused death for all. Another interpretation (of Deut. 3:26): <small>SO THE LORD SAID UNTO ME: ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; The litigant against you has already preceded you, as Job has already stated (in Job 31:35): <small>O THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE ME A HEARING</small>&#x0021; [<small>HERE IS MY SIGNATURE. LET THE ALMIGHTY ANSWER ME, AND LET MY ACCUSER WRITE A TRUE BILL</small> (literally: <small>A BOOK</small>.] Which [<small>BOOK</small>]? (Gen. 5:1:) <small>THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE GENERATIONS OF ADAM</small>. So what did Job say (in Job 3:19)? <small>THE SMALL AND THE GREAT ARE THERE, AND THE SLAVE</small> (&#x2018;<italic>eved</italic>) <small>IS FREE FROM HIS MASTERS</small>. Ergo (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; <small>DO NOT &#x003C;EVER&#x003E; SPEAK &#x003C;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&#x003E; AGAIN</small>.</p>
<title>2.6 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part VI</title>
<p>[(Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; <small>DO NOT &#x003C;EVER&#x003E; SPEAK &#x003C;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&#x003E; AGAIN</small>.] This is related to what Job said (in Job 20:6): <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE&#x2019;S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS, AND HIS HEAD REACHES THE CLOUDS</small>. With reference to what does this scripture speak? It only speaks with reference to the day of death.<sup><xref rid="fn1183">18</xref></sup> So even though one ascends to the heavens and makes himself wings like a bird, when his time to die arrives, his wings are broken, and he falls before the angel of death like an animal before the butcher. So also has David said (in Ps. 146:4): <small>HIS SPIRIT DEPARTS; HE RETURNS TO THE GROUND; &#x003C;ON THAT DAY HIS PLANS PERISH&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Job 20:6): <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE&#x2019;S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS</small>. This refers to Moses, who ascended to the firmament and whose feet trod on Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from his hand. When his time to die arrived, he said to him (in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>. &#x003C;Moses&#x003E; said to him: Sovereign of the world, is it for nothing that my feet have trodden Araphel? Is it for nothing that I have run before your children like a horse? Is my end the worm and the maggot? R. Abbahu said: To what is the matter comparable? To one of the nobles of the kingdom, who found a certain Hindu sword, which was unmatched [in the world] and who said: This is suitable only for the king. What did he do? He brought it to the king as a gift.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">19</xref></sup> The king said: Cut off his head with it. So also Moses said to the Holy One: By the word that I &#x003C;used to&#x003E; praise<sup><xref rid="fn1185">20</xref></sup> you, when I said (in Deut. 10:14): <small>BEHOLD</small> (<italic>hen</italic>), <small>&#x003C;THE HEAVENS AND THE HEAVENS OF THE HEAVENS, THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS IN IT&#x003E; BELONG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>&#x0021; by that &#x003C;very&#x003E; word (i.e., <italic>hen</italic>) you are decreeing death over me, when you say (in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD</small> (<italic>hen</italic>), <small>THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU &#x003C;TO DIE&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">21</xref></sup> He said to him: I have already decreed<sup><xref rid="fn1187">22</xref></sup> death over the first Adam. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, [the first] Adam deserved to die. You decreed an easy commandment for him, and he transgressed it. But I should not die. He said to him: Consider Abraham, who sanctified my name in the world but &#x003C;still&#x003E; died. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, consider &#x003C;the fact that&#x003E; out of him there came Ishmael, whose race provoked you to anger, as stated (in Job 12:6) <small>THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY, THE ONES WHOM GOD BROUGHT FORTH IN HIS HAND</small>. He said to him: consider Isaac, who stretched out his neck upon the altar. He said to him: Out of him there came Esau the Wicked, who destroyed your sanctuary and burned your temple. He said to him: Consider Jacob, out of whom there came twelve tribes. He said to him Jacob did not ascend into the firmament, his feet did not trod Araphel, he did not receive Torah from your hand, and he did not speak with you face to face. The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; <small>DO NOT &#x003C;EVER&#x003E; SPEAK &#x003C;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&#x003E; AGAIN</small>. He said to him: Perhaps &#x003C;future&#x003E; generations will say: If he had not found evil things in Moses, he would not have removed him from the world. He said to him: I have already written in my Torah (in Deut. 34:10): <small>NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES</small>. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, perhaps [the people will say] I did your will in my youth, but I did not do your will in my old age. He said to him: I have already written (in Deut. 32:51): [<small>BECAUSE YOU ACTED FAITHLESSLY WITH ME</small>] <small>&#x003C;AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AT THE WATERS OF MERIBATH-KADESH IN THE WILDERNESS OF ZIN&#x003E;, BECAUSE YOU DID NOT SANCTIFY ME &#x003C;AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">23</xref></sup> He said to him: If you are willing, let me enter the land [and spend] two or three years [there], and after that let me die. He said to him: It is an irrevocable decision from me. He said to him: If I am not to enter while alive, let me enter after my death. He said to him: Not while you are alive, and not when you are dead. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, why all this anger against me? (According to Deut. 32:51) <small>BECAUSE HE DID NOT SANCTIFY ME</small>. He said to him: With all mortals you are guided two or three times by the principle of mercy, as stated (in Job 33:29): <small>BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A MAN</small>; yet in my case, when a single sin is found in me, you do not forgive me. The Holy One said to him: See here, Moses, you have committed six sins, and I have not disclosed one of them. (1) In the first place you said (in Exod. 4:13) <small>PLEASE MAKE SOMEONE ELSE YOUR AGENT</small>. (2, in Exod. 5:23:) <small>FOR EVER SINCE I CAME TO PHARAOH TO SPEAK IN YOUR NAME</small>, [<small>HE HAS DEALT WORSE WITH THIS PEOPLE, AND YOU HAVE STILL NOT DELIVERED YOUR PEOPLE</small>]. (3, In Numb. 16:29:) <small>THE LORD DID NOT SEND ME</small>. (4, In Numb. 16:30:) <small>BUT IF THE LORD CREATES SOMETHING NEW</small>. (5, In Numb. 20:10:) <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS, &#x003C;SHALL WE BRING FORTH WATER FOR YOU FROM THIS ROCK&#x003E;</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1189">24</xref></sup> (6, Numb:32:14:) <small>AND NOW YOU BROOD OF SINNERS HAVE ARISEN IN PLACE OF YOUR ANCESTORS</small>. But were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob sinners, for you to say this to their children? He said to him: I have learned so from you, when you said (in Numb. 17:3 [16:38]): <small>THE CENSERS OF &#x003C;THESE&#x003E; WHO HAVE SINNED &#x003C;AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES&#x003E;</small>. He said to him: I said (ibid.): <small>AT THE COST OF THEIR LIVES</small>, and not: &#x201C;At the cost of their ancestors.&#x201D; He said to him: Sovereign of the World: I am an individual, while Israel numbers sixty myriads (i.e., 600,000). They have sinned before you a lot of times; and when I sought mercy on their behalf, you forgave them. You took care of sixty myriads because of me, yet you are not taking care of me. He said to him: Moses, a decree over a community is not like a decree over an individual. Furthermore, up to now time was delivered into your hands, but now time is not delivered into your hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, rise up from the seat of judgment and sit down upon the seat of mercy for me, so that I do not die. Then my sins shall be forgiven through torments which you have brought on my body. So do not deliver me into the bonds of the angel of death. Moreover, if you do this, I will proclaim your praise to all who come into the world, just as David has said (in Ps. 118:17&#x2013;18): <small>I SHALL NOT DIE, BUT LIVE AND RECOUNT THE WORKS OF THE LORD. &#x003C;THE LORD HAS PUNISHED ME SEVERELY, BUT HE DID NOT HAND ME OVER TO DEATH</small>.&#x003E; He said to him (in vs. 20): <small>THIS IS THE GATE OF THE LORD</small>; [<small>THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL COME THROUGH IT</small>.] From this it follows that for the righteous and for all mortals death has been ordained from time immemorial. When Moses saw that they paid no attention to him, he went to heaven and earth, where he said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 51:6): <small>FOR THE HEAVENS SHALL VANISH LIKE SMOKE, AND THE EARTH SHALL WEAR OUT LIKE A GARMENT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">25</xref></sup> He went to the sun and the moon. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: Instead of us seeking mercy for you, we should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 24:23): <small>THEN THE MOON SHALL BE ASHAMED, AND THE SUN SHALL BE ABASHED</small>. He went to the stars and planets. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: [Instead of us seeking mercy for you,] we should seek mercy for ourselves, [since it is stated] (in Is. 34:4): <small>ALL THE HOST OF HEAVEN SHALL ROT AWAY</small> [&#x2026;.] He went to the mountains and hills. He said to them: Seek mercy for me. They said to him: We should seek mercy for ourselves, since it is stated (in Is. 54:10): <small>FOR THE MOUNTAINS SHALL MOVE, AND THE HILLS SHALL BE SHAKEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1191">26</xref></sup> He went to the Great Sea. He said to it: [Seek mercy for me. The sea] said to him: Son of Amram, how is today different from a couple of &#x003C;other&#x003E; days? Are you not the son of Amram? &#x003C;Are you not the one&#x003E; who came upon me with your rod, smote me, and divided me into twelve parts? For I was unable to stand before you because the Divine Presence was walking at your right hand. It is so stated (in Is. 63:12): <small>WHO HAD &#x003C;HIS GLORIOUS ARM&#x003E; WALK AT THE RIGHT HAND OF MOSES, &#x003C;WHO DIVIDED THE WATERS BEFORE THEM&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. So now what has happened to you? When the sea reminded him what he had done in his youth, he cried out and said (in Job 29:2): <small>O THAT I WERE AS IN THE MONTHS OF OLD, &#x003C;AS IN THE DAYS WHEN GOD WATCHED OVER ME&#x003E;</small>&#x0021; When I stood by you, I was a king in the world; but now I am prostrate, and they pay no attention to me. Immediately he betook himself to the Arch&#x003C;angel&#x003E; of the &#x003C;Divine&#x003E; Presence and said to him: Seek mercy for me, that I not die. He said to him: My Master, Moses, why is this a problem? This is what I have heard from behind the Curtain:<sup><xref rid="fn1192">27</xref></sup> that your prayer has not been heard on this matter. Putting his hands on his head, Moses sobbed and wept, as he said: With whom shall I seek mercy for myself? R. Simlay said: At that time the Holy One was full of anger over him, as stated (in Deut. 3:26): <small>BUT THE LORD WAS ANGRY WITH ME</small>, until Moses began by uttering this scripture: (Exod. 34:6:) [<small>THEN THE LORD PASSED BEFORE HIM AND PROCLAIMED</small>:] <small>THE LORD: THE LORD IS A MERCIFUL AND GRACIOUS GOD, &#x003C;SLOW TO ANGER&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Immediately the Holy Spirit cooled him off. The Holy One said to Moses: Moses, I have sworn two oaths, one that you should die and one to destroy Israel. To repeal both of them is impossible; so if you want to live, Israel will be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, are you coming to me with a plot? You are seizing the rope at both ends. Let Moses and a thousand like him be destroyed, but do not let one person in Israel be destroyed. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, should feet that have climbed up to the firmament, should a face that has greeted the Divine Presence, should hands that have received Torah from your hand lick the dust? Woe<sup><xref rid="fn1193">28</xref></sup> to all mortals. They will say: If Moses, who ascended on high, became like the ministering angels, spoke with him face to face, and received Torah from his hand, had no reply for responding to the Holy One, how much the worse it will be for &#x003C;mere&#x003E; flesh and blood, who comes with no Torah and with no commandments? The Holy One said to Moses: Why all this sorrow over which you are sorrowing? He said: Sovereign of the World, I am afraid of the bonds of the angel of death. He said to him: I am not delivering you into his hands. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, my mother [Jochebed], who was put to shame (literally: whose teeth were blunted) during her lifetime by two of her sons, will be put to shame by my death. He said to him: This has come to mind, but this is the way of the world: every generation with its expositors, every generation with its administrators,<sup><xref rid="fn1194">29</xref></sup> every generation with its leaders. Up to now it has been your lot to serve &#x003C;me&#x003E;, [but now the lot of your disciple Joshua has arrived for him to serve &#x003C;me&#x003E;]. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, if I am dying because of Joshua, let me go and become his disciple&#x0021; He said to him: If you want to do that, go and do it. Moses arose and went early to Joshua&#x2019;s door.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">30</xref></sup> Now Joshua was seated expounding &#x003C;Torah&#x003E;, so Moses stopped to bend his proud stature and put his hand on his mouth. But Joshua&#x2019;s eyes were hidden, and he did not see him, so that he (Moses) would be sorrowful and resign himself [to death]. When Israel came to Moses&#x2019; door, they found him at the door of Joshua with Joshua sitting and Moses standing. They said to Joshua: What has come over you that Moses our Master stands, while you sit? When he raised his eyes and saw him, he immediately rent his clothes. Then sobbing and weeping, he said: O my Master, my Master&#x0021; My Father, my Father and Lord&#x0021; Israel said to Moses: Moses our Master, teach us Torah. He said to them: I have no authority. They said to him: We are not leaving you. A heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) came forth and said to them: Learn from Joshua. They took upon themselves to sit and learn from the mouth of Joshua. Joshua sat at the head with Moses to his right and with Eleazar and Ithamar to his left. So he sat and expounded in the presence of Moses. R. Samuel bar Nahmani said: R. Johanan said: When Joshua opened by saying: Blessed be the one who has chosen the righteous and their Mishnaic teaching, they took the traditions of wisdom from Moses and gave them to Joshua. Now Moses did not know what Joshua was expounding. After Israel arose &#x003C;from the session&#x003E;, they said to Moses: Close off the Torah for us. He said to them: I do not know what to answer you. So Moses our Master was stumbling and falling. It was at that time that he said: Sovereign of the World, up to now I wanted to live, but now here is my soul given over to you.. Then when he had resigned his soul to death, the Holy One opened by saying (in Ps. 94:16): <small>WHO WILL STAND FOR ME AGAINST EVILDOERS</small>? Who will stand for Israel in the time of my wrath? Who will stand in the battle of my children? And who will stand and seek mercy for them, when they sin before me? At that time Metatron<sup><xref rid="fn1196">31</xref></sup> came and fell on his face. He said to him: Sovereign of the World, &#x003C;as&#x003E; in Moses&#x2019; life he belonged to you, so in his death he belongs to you. The Holy One said to him: Let me give you a parable. To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. Now on each and every day his father was angry with him and sought to kill him, because he did not maintain respect for his father; but his mother rescued him from his hand. One day his mother died and the king wept. Her servants said to him: Our Lord King, why are you weeping? He said to them: It is not over my wife alone that I am weeping, but for my son; for many times when I was angry with him and wanted to kill him, she rescued him from my hand. So also did the Holy One say to Metatron: It is not over Moses alone that I am weeping, but over him and over Israel, for look at how many times that they angered me, and I was angry with them; but he stood in the breach before me [to turn back my anger from destroying them]. They came and said to Moses: The hour has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said to them: Wait for me until I bless Israel, for they have not found contentment from me all my days, because of the rebukes and warnings with which I rebuked them. He began to bless each tribe separately. When he saw that the time was growing short, he included all of them in a single blessing. They came and said: The hour has arrived for your soul to depart from the world. He said to Israel: I have caused you a lot of grief over the Torah and over the commandments, but now forgive me. They said to him: Our Lord Master, you are forgiven. Israel also arose before him and said to him: O Moses our Master, we have angered you a lot and increased the burden upon you. Forgive us. He said to them: You are forgiven. They came and said to him: The moment has arrived for you to depart from the world. He said: Blessed be the name of the one who lives and abides forever. He said to Israel: If you please, when you enter the land, remember me and my bones. They said: Woe (<italic>oy</italic>) to the son of Amram, who ran before us like a horse but whose bones have fallen in the wilderness. They came and said to him: The half moment has arrived. He took his two arms and placed them on his heart. Then he said to Israel: See the final end of flesh and blood. My two hands with which I received the Torah from the mouth of the Almighty shall fall in the grave. At that moment his breath departed with a kiss (from the Holy One),<sup><xref rid="fn1197">32</xref></sup> as stated (in Deut. 34:5): <small>THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF MOAB AT THE COMMAND OF THE LORD</small> (literally: <small>ON THE MOUTH OF THE LORD</small>)&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1198">33</xref></sup> Now &#x003C;the ones who&#x003E; took care of his burial were neither Israel nor any of the angels but the Holy One &#x003C;himself&#x003E;, as stated (in vs. 6): <small>THEN HE</small> (<small>THE HOLY ONE</small>) <small>BURIED HIM</small> (<small>MOSES</small>) <small>IN THE VALLEY &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF MOAB&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And for what reason was he buried outside the land? So that those who die when outside the land might live again through his merit,<sup><xref rid="fn1199">34</xref></sup> as stated (in Deut. 33:21): <small>HE HAS CHOSEN THE BEST FOR HIMSELF, &#x003C;FOR THERE IS AN HONORED LAWGIVER&#x2019;S PORTION, WHERE HE CAME AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE. HE CARRIED OUT THE LORD&#x2019;</small>s <small>RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIS ORDINANCES FOR ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. But when did Moses our Master die? On the seventh of Adar,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">35</xref></sup> as stated (in Deut. 34:5): <small>THEN MOSES THE SERVANT OF THE LORD DIED THERE &#x003C;IN THE LAND OF MOAB&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. It is also written (in vs. 8): <small>AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MOURNED MOSES ON THE PLAINS OF MOAB FOR THIRTY DAYS</small>. And it is written (in Josh. 1:1&#x2013;2): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF MOSES, THE SERVANT OF THE LORD, &#x003C;THE LORD SPOKE UNTO JOSHUA BEN NUN, MOSES&#x2019; ATTENDANT, SAYING&#x003E;: MOSES MY SERVANT IS DEAD</small>. (Josh. 4:19:) <small>NOW THE PEOPLE CAME UP FROM THE JORDAN ON THE TENTH DAY OF</small> &#x007B;<small>THIS</small>&#x007D; [<small>THE FIRST</small>] <small>MONTH</small> (i.e., Nisan). Reckon back from those thirty-three days. Ergo, he died on the seventh of Adar. And where is it shown that he was born on the seventh of Adar? Where it is stated (in Deut. 31:2): <small>HE SAID TO THEM: I AM ONE HUNDRED TWENTY YEARS OLD TODAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1201">36</xref></sup> What is the significance of <small>TODAY</small>? &#x003C;It is there&#x003E; to teach you that the Holy One fulfills the years for the righteous from day to day and from month to month, as stated (in Exod. 23:26): <small>I WILL FULFILL THE NUMBER OF YOUR DAYS</small>.</p>

<title>Appendix to Chapter 2 Deuteronomy, Parashah IIa: Supplement to <italic>Wa&#x2019;ethannan</italic></title>
<p>according to Buber&#x2019;s fifth Oxford manuscript.</p>
<p>This manuscript is described by Buber on pp. 143&#x2013;147 of his introduction.</p>
<title>2a.1 Deuteronomy 3:23ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Job 20:6:) <small>EVEN THOUGH ONE&#x2019;S HEIGHT ASCENDS TO THE HEAVENS</small>. This refers to Moses, when he ascended unto the firmament and drew near unto the Araphel (the lower sky). Moreover, he was like the ministering angels in that he spoke with him (i.e., with the Holy One) face to face and received the Torah from the hand of the Holy One. But when he besought him that he not die, the Holy One said to him: (in Deut. 3:26): <small>DO NOT &#x003C;EVER&#x003E; SPEAK &#x003C;UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER&#x003E; AGAIN</small>. Why was the Holy One angry with Moses? Because he had rebuked Israel. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had a son. He handed him over to a <italic>paidagogos</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1202">1</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; the <italic>paidagogos</italic> became angry with him and reprimanded him, the king heard &#x003C;about the reprimand&#x003E; and said: By the life of my kingdom, you are not entering my palace.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">2</xref></sup> Similarly when Moses said to Israel (in Numb. 20:10): <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS</small>, the Holy One said to him (in Numb. 20:12): <small>THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION &#x003C;INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 3:24:) <small>YOU HAVE &#x003C;ONLY&#x003E; BEGUN</small> &#x003C;<small>TO SHOW YOUR SERVANT YOUR GREATNESS AND YOUR MIGHT&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small> He said to him: You are the one who opened a door for me to pray to you.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">3</xref></sup> When? When they did that deed.<sup><xref rid="fn1205">4</xref></sup> The Holy One said to him (in Deut. 9:14): <small>LET ME ALONE, AND I WILL DESTROY THEM AND BLOT OUT THEIR NAME FROM UNDER THE HEAVENS</small>. Moses said: Who would seize hold of the Holy One? One only seeks to pray for one&#x2019;s children. What is written there (in Exod. 32:11)? <small>AND MOSES IMPLORED THE LORD HIS GOD</small>. Moses said: Once I prayed for the community and was answered, but the community prayed for me and was not answered. Why? Because you have issued a decree over me &#x003C;for calling them rebels&#x003E;&#x0021; But you were the one who began by calling them &#x003C;rebels&#x003E; (in Numb. 17:25 [10]): <small>&#x003C;PUT BACK AARON&#x2019;S ROD &#x2026; &#x003E; TO BE KEPT AS A SIGN FOR THE CHILDREN OF REBELLION</small>. Then because I called them &#x003C;rebels&#x003E; (in Numb. 20:10): <small>LISTEN, YOU REBELS</small>, you said (in 20:12): <small>THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT LEAD THIS CONGREGATION &#x003C;INTO THE LAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN THEM&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 3:26:) <small>BUT THE LORD WAS WRATHFUL WITH ME</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WAS WRATHFUL</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>)? R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagreed. One said: He was full of wrath (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>), while the other said: He made him like a pregnant (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RB</small></italic>) woman who cannot sit because of her fetus. The Holy One said to Moses: You are an example<sup><xref rid="fn1206">5</xref></sup> for judges, and they pervert justice. Therefore (in Deut. 3:26): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; You have a lot &#x003C;of merit stored&#x003E; with me for the world to come, where I am repaying you. It is also stated about this (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU</small>.</p>
<title>2a.2 Deuteronomy 4:25ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 4:25:) <small>WHEN YOU HAVE BEGOTTEN CHILDREN AND CHILDREN&#x2019;S CHILDREN</small>. This text is related (to Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>. When Moses arrived at passing from the world, the Holy One declared to him what Israel was going to do after the death of Joshua. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 31:16): <small>THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD, YOU ARE SOON TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS. THEN THIS PEOPLE WILL ARISE AND GO WHORING AFTER THE ALIEN GODS OF THE LAND</small>. For that reason Moses warned them (in Deut. 31:29): <small>FOR I KNOW THAT AFTER MY DEATH YOU WILL SURELY ACT CORRUPTLY</small>. But they said to him: We will not do this thing. He said to them: You are going to beget <small>CHILDREN AND CHILDREN&#x2019;S CHILDREN</small> and forget the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Deut. 4:26; 30:19): <small>I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY&#x2026;.</small> Ergo (in Is. 46:10): <small>DECLARING THE END FROM THE BEGINNING</small>.</p>
<p>And so you find that Israel did everything that he had said to them in the days of the judges, as stated (in Jud. 10:6): <small>&#x003C;AGAIN THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL DID WHAT WAS EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD&#x003E; AND SERVED THE BAALS AND THE ASTARTES</small>. So also Jeroboam, as stated (in I Kings 12:28&#x2013;29): <small>SO THE KING TOOK COUNSEL AND MADE TWO CALVES OF GOLD &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; THEN HE SET ONE IN BETHEL AND THE OTHER HE</small> &#x007B;<small>SET</small>&#x007D; [<small>PUT</small>] <small>IN DAN</small>. Moreover, he did not allow Israel to go up to Jerusalem. Instead he said: These are your Gods, O Israel. So also Ahab sinned and made Israel sin more than all he wicked ones who came before him. (I Kings 16:30:) <small>AND AHAB</small> [<small>BEN OMRI</small>] <small>DID MORE EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD THAN ALL WHO &#x003C;HAD COME&#x003E; BEFORE HIM</small>. You yourself know that he sold himself to idolatrous worship, as stated (in I Kings 21:25): <small>&#x003C;INDEED THERE WAS NO ONE&#x003E; LIKE AHAB WHO SOLD HIMSELF TO DO EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD</small>. He also made them forget the name of the Holy One. How? He blotted out the references &#x003C;to the Divine Name&#x003E; and wrote in their place, &#x003C;e.g.,&#x003E; &#x201C;And Baal spoke,&#x201D; &#x201C;In the beginning Baal,&#x201D; &#x201C;And Baal said.&#x201D; And for all the whole Torah he did likewise. That is what the prophet says (in Jer. 23:27): <small>THE ONES WHO INTEND TO MAKE MY PEOPLE FORGET MY NAME</small>. But Menasseh did more than all of them, as stated (in II Chron 33:7; cf. II Kings 21:7): <small>AND HE SET UP A SCULPTURED IMAGE &#x003C;WHICH HE HAD MADE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. (II Chron. 33:6 // II <small>KINGS</small> 21:6): <small>AND HE HAD HIS SONS PASS THROUGH FIRE</small> &#x007B;<small>FOR MOLECH</small>&#x007D; <small>IN THE VALLEY OF BEN-HINNOM. HE ALSO PRACTICED SOOTHSAYING, AUGURY</small>, [<small>SORCERY</small>,] <small>NECROMANCY, AND WIZARDRY</small>. [<small>HE DID MUCH EVIL IN THE EYES OF THE LORD TO PROVOKE HIM TO ANGER</small>.] And how &#x003C;did he do it&#x003E;? Molech was in the valley of Ben-hinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">6</xref></sup> It took place outside of Jerusalem and in a remote place. There was also an image &#x003C;there&#x003E; with the face of a calf and with its hands extended like a human [whose hands are open to receive] something from one&#x2019;s friend. Then they heated it until its hands became like fire. It also had seven latticed gates,<sup><xref rid="fn1208">7</xref></sup> with &#x003C;the image&#x003E; behind the innermost of them. Each and every one would enter in accordance with his offering. Whoever offered a bird entered the first lattice gate. With a goat he entered the second lattice gate; with a lamb, the third; with a calf, the fourth; with a bullock, the fifth; with a bull, the sixth. To whoever was offering his child the idol priests would say that there is none higher than that. He entered within the seventh lattice gate. Then he went and kissed it, as stated (in Hos. 13:2): <small>THOSE WHO SACRIFICE A HUMAN BEING KISS CALVES</small>. Then the idol priests would take his child from him and put the young child<sup><xref rid="fn1209">8</xref></sup> upon the hands of Molech, while they took the drums and beat on them, so that the father would not hear the voice of his child. Then they pressed the young child&#x2019;s entrails upon it, while the young child screamed until &#x003C;its spirit&#x003E; left its body in the hands of &#x003C;the idol&#x003E;. R Judah the Levite said: That is what is written (in Jer. 7:31): <small>AND THEY HAVE BUILT THE HIGH PLACES OF TOPHETH, WHICH ARE IN THE VALLEY OF BEN-HINNOM &#x003C;TO BURN THEIR SONS AND THEIR DAUGHTERS IN THE FIRE&#x003E;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>TOPHETH</small>? That they beat on their drums (<italic>tuppim</italic>, sing.: <italic>toph</italic>). What is the meaning of <small>HINNOM</small>? That the idol priests said to Molech, when the young child screamed (rt.: <italic><small>NHM</small></italic>): May it be pleasing to you&#x0021; May it be appealing to you&#x0021; Look at how fervent they were for idolatry&#x0021; The Holy One said: It is on account of the evil drive (<italic>yetser hara</italic>) that you have sinned and gone into exile; but in the age to come I am rooting it (i.e., the evil drive) out of you,<sup><xref rid="fn1210">9</xref></sup> as stated (in Ezek. 36:26): <small>I WILL REMOVE THE HEART OF STONE FROM YOUR FLESH AND GIVE YOU A HEART OF FLESH</small>.</p>
<title>2a.3 Deuteronomy 4:41ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES</small>. This text is related (to Eccl. 5:9 [10]): <small>A LOVER OF MONEY NEVER RECEIVES ENOUGH MONEY; NOR WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE, &#x003C;ENOUGH&#x003E; PRODUCE. &#x003C;THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. &#x003E; R. Nehemiah says: Whoever loves the Torah never receives enough Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1211">10</xref></sup> &#x003C;When&#x003E; one learns Mishnah, he seeks to learn the Talmud. &#x003C;When&#x003E; one learns, Talmud, he seeks to learn Tosafot.<sup><xref rid="fn1212">11</xref></sup> So also: <small>NOR WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE, ENOUGH PRODUCE</small>. Nor does he raise up students.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">12</xref></sup> <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Eccl. 5:9 [10]): <small>WHOEVER LOVES ABUNDANCE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HMH</small></italic>), &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; whoever longs for (rt.: <italic><small>HMH</small></italic>) and yearns (rt.: <italic><small>HMH</small></italic>) after the commandments. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>NOR &#x003C;ENOUGH&#x003E; PRODUCE</small>, for he does not have good works. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THIS ALSO IS VANITY</small>. Moreover, the one who cherishes the commandments is Moses. For when he came to pass from the world, &#x003C; there was&#x003E; a small commandment that he had left out. He would not pass from the world until &#x003C;in his words &#x003E;: I separate it out while I still have the power in hand. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:41): <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES</small>.</p>
<title>2a.4 Deuteronomy 4:41ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THEN</small>? &#x003C;It is&#x003E; a word &#x003C;denoting&#x003E; a song. Who uttered a song? The murderer of whom it is written (in Numb. 35:16): <small>THE MURDERER SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH</small>; for the murderer will not be slain.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: Who uttered a song? Moses uttered a song. A common<sup><xref rid="fn1215">14</xref></sup> proverb says: Whoever eats the dish knows how it tastes.<sup><xref rid="fn1216">15</xref></sup> Because he had killed the Egyptian and fled, he therefore knew what was in the soul of a killer. So it says (in Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation: Who uttered a song? Israel uttered a song. Since it is written (in Numb. 35:33): <small>AND FOR THE LAND THERE IS NO EXPIATION FOR THE BLOOD &#x003C;THAT IS SHED UPON IT, EXCEPT BY THE BLOOD OF THE ONE WHO SHED IT&#x003E;</small>. Israel said: Shall whoever kills by accident be killed? When Moses stated his remedy for the matter, Israel uttered a song.</p>
<p>(Deut. 4:41:) <small>THEN MOSES SET APART THREE CITIES &#x003C;ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE JORDAN &#x003E; TOWARD THE RISING OF THE SUN</small>. All murderers flee eastward. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:24): <small>AND AT THE EAST OF THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE POSTED &#x003C;THE CHERUBIM&#x003E;</small>. Cain fled to eastward, as stated (in Gen. 4:16): <small>AND CAIN WENT OUT FROM BEFORE THE LORD AND DWELT IN THE LAND OF NOD, EAST OF EDEN</small>.</p>
<p>Thus it is written (in Deut. 4:41): <small>TOWARD THE RISING OF THE SUN</small>. Israel said: Sovereign of the World, what about one who takes<sup><xref rid="fn1217">16</xref></sup> a life unwillingly? The Holy One said: In the case of whoever takes a life by accident, behold, I have given him a place where he may flee. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 28:17): <small>SOMEONE OPPRESSED BY BLOODGUILT WILL BE A FUGITIVE TO THE GRAVE; LET NO ONE SUPPORT HIM</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WILL BE A FUGITIVE TO THE GRAVE</small>? The Holy One said: In the case of whoever has sinned by accident, behold, I have given him a place in the region of Reuben, (as stated in Deut. 4:43:) <small>BEZER IN THE WILDERNESS IN THE LAND OF THE PLATEAU &#x003C;BELONGING TO THE REUBENITES&#x003C;&#x2026;. &#x003E;</small></p>
<title>2a.5 Deuteronomy 4:41ff, Part III</title>

<title>3.1 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &#x003C;THESE STATUTES&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 49:6 [5]): <small>WHY SHOULD I FEAR IN THE EVIL DAYS, WHEN THE INIQUITY OF MY HEELS ENCOMPASS ME</small>? May the Name of the Holy One be blessed, because he has given a Torah to Israel in which there are six hundred and thirteen simple and weighty commandments;<sup><xref rid="fn1220">1</xref></sup> but the children of Adam pay no attention to them. Instead they cast them under their heels while saying they are simple.<sup><xref rid="fn1221">2</xref></sup> For that reason David was afraid of the Day of Judgment and said: Sovereign of the Universe, I am not afraid of the weighty commandments which are in the Torah, because they are weighty. Of what am I afraid? Of the simple commandments, lest I have transgressed one of them, whether I have fulfilled it or not, because it is simple; for you have said: Be as mindful of the simple commandments as of the weighty commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">3</xref></sup> It therefore says (in Ps. 49:6 [5]): <small>WHY SHOULD I FEAR IN THE EVIL DAYS</small>?</p>
<title>3.2 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &#x003C;THESE STATUTES&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 19:11&#x2013;12 [10&#x2013;11]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD; &#x003C;SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB&#x003E;. ALSO BY THEM IS YOUR SERVANT WARNED; &#x003C;IN KEEPING THEM THERE IS GREAT REWARD&#x003E;</small>. Come and see how David glorified the word of Torah, where it is stated (ibid.): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small>. And not only that, but among all the kinds of grains, none is more precious than pure semolina, which coats the mouth;<sup><xref rid="fn1223">4</xref></sup> but the words of Torah are more precious than that, as stated (ibid., vs. 11 [10]): <small>SWEETER ALSO THAN HONEY AND THE DRIPPINGS OF THE COMB</small>. R. Hanina said: If you say that among all the beverages none is sweeter than honey, the words of Torah are &#x003C;even&#x003E; sweeter than honey. David said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you say that they (the commandments of Torah) are sweet, Heaven forbid that I should have ignored them. Rather (according to vs. 12 [11]), <small>ALSO BY THEM IS YOUR SERVANT WARNED; IN KEEPING THEM THERE IS GREAT REWARD</small>. Therefore (in Ps. 31:20 [19]): <small>HOW ABUNDANT IS THE GOOD &#x003C;WHICH YOU HAVE LAID UP FOR THOSE WHO FEAR YOU&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> This is your reward for the simple commandments.</p>
<title>3.3 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &#x003C;THESE STATUTES&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 5:6): <small>SHE DOES NOT STEER A STRAIGHT PATH OF LIFE; HER WAYS WANDER, AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT</small>. [R. Abba bar Kahana said:] You should not practice give and take among the commandments of Torah to see which reward of Torah and commandment is greatest and perform that one.<sup><xref rid="fn1224">5</xref></sup> Why? (Ibid.:) <small>HER WAYS WANDER, AND SHE DOES NOT KNOW IT</small>. The paths of the Torah are movable. R. Hiyya said: A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard and introduced workers into it, but the king did not disclose to them the reward (i.e., the payment) for his seedlings, because if he revealed the reward for his &#x003C;various&#x003E; seedlings, one would see which seedling increased &#x003C;their&#x003E; reward, and plant that one. The work in the orchard would end up with some of it suspended and some of it carried out. Similarly the Holy One did not reveal the reward for each and every commandment in the Torah; for if he had revealed it, the commandments would have been found with some of them carried out and some of them suspended. R. Aha also &#x003C;said&#x003E; in the name of R. Abba bar Kahana: The Holy One has made the reward for fulfilling commandments irregular in this world, so that Israel would totally fulfill them.<sup><xref rid="fn1225">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Simeon ben Johay taught: For two commandments the Holy One did reveal their reward. These are the simplest of the simple and the most weighty of the weighty ones. The simplest of the simple ones is (Deut. 22:7): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY LET THE MOTHER &#x003C;BIRD&#x003E; GO AND TAKE &#x003C;ONLY&#x003E; THE YOUNG FOR YOUR SELF, SO THAT IT WILL GO WELL WITH YOU, AND YOU WILL PROLONG YOUR DAYS</small>. The most weighty is (in Deut. 5:16 // Exod. 20:12): <small>HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER &#x2026;, SO THAT HE WILL LENGTHEN YOUR DAYS&#x2026;..</small><sup><xref rid="fn1226">7</xref></sup> Note that they are equal this world with regard to reward. Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: If in regard to paying a debt, about &#x003C;which&#x003E; length of days is written,<sup><xref rid="fn1227">8</xref></sup> how much the more so when it is a case of damage to purse and loss of life. R. Levi said: They said something more significant than that. A case of paying a debt is more important than a case of damage to purse and loss of life. R. Simeon ben Johay said: Just as their reward is great, so are their punishments great. That is what is written (in Prov. 30:17):<small>THE EYE THAT MOCKS A FATHER AND SCORNS OBEYING A MOTHER WILL HAVE THE WADI RAVENS PLUCK IT OUT AND THE YOUNG EAGLES DEVOUR IT</small>. Why will ravens pluck it out and eagles devour it? The Holy One said: A raven, which is cruel to its young, will come and pluck it out without profiting from it; an eagle, which is merciful to its young, will come and will profit from it. And where is it shown that a raven is cruel to its young? Where it is stated (in Job 38:41): <small>WHO PROVIDES PREY FOR THE RAVEN</small>, [<small>WHEN ITS YOUNG CRY UNTO GOD AND WANDER ABOUT WITHOUT FOOD</small>]. It also says (in Ps. 147:9): <small>TO YOUNG RAVENS WHEN THEY CRY OUT</small>. When the raven reproduces, it reproduces white &#x003C;young&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1228">9</xref></sup> Then the male says to the female that another bird has begotten it. So they reject and forsake them. What does the Holy One do? He brings forth gnats from their dung.<sup><xref rid="fn1229">10</xref></sup> Then &#x003C;the young&#x003E; fly, and eat, and from that become black.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">11</xref></sup> This is what is written (in Job 38:41): <small>WHO PROVIDES PREY FOR THE RAVEN</small>. But where is it shown for the eagle, that it is merciful? Where it is written (in Deut. 32:11): <small>AS AN EAGLE STIRS UP ITS NEST &#x003C;AND HOVERS OVER ITS YOUNG&#x003E;</small>. However, no one trusts them because of other birds who pursue them. What does it do? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>IT SPREADS ITS WINGS, TAKES THEM UP, &#x003C;AND BEARS THEM ALOFT ON ITS PINIONS&#x003E;</small>. Ergo (in Prov. 30:17): <small>THE WADI RAVENS PLUCK IT OUT, AND THE YOUNG EAGLES DEVOUR IT</small>.</p>
<title>3.4 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 7:12:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IF YOU HEED &#x003C;THESE STATUTES&#x003E;</small>. What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 7:7)? <small>IT WAS NOT BECAUSE YOU WERE THE MOST NUMEROUS OF ALL THE PEOPLES, &#x003C;THAT THE LORD DESIRED YOU AND CHOSE YOU. RATHER YOU WERE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to Israel: It was not because you were the most numerous of all the nations, and it was not because you fulfilled more commandments than they, for they magnify my name more than you.<sup><xref rid="fn1231">12</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Mal. 1:11&#x2013;12): <small>FOR FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN UNTIL ITS SETTING MY NAME IS GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS, &#x003C;AND IN EVERY PLACE INCENSE IS OFFERED TO MY NAME, EVEN A PURE OBLATION; FOR MY NAME IS GREAT AMONG THE NATIONS, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS&#x003E;. BUT YOU DESECRATE IT WHEN YOU SAY THE TABLE OF THE LORD IS DEFILED, AND ITS SPECIAL FOOD IS TREATED WITH SCORN &#x003C;LIKE ORDINARY&#x003E; FOOD</small>. (Deut. 7:7&#x2013;8): <small>RATHER YOU WERE THE LEAST OF ALL THE PEOPLES. IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE LORD&#x2019;S LOVE FOR YOU</small>. Because you diminish yourselves for me, I therefore love you, and so it says (in Mal. 1:2&#x2013;3): <small>I HAVE LOVED YOU, SAYS THE LORD &#x2026;; BUT I HAVE HATED ESAU&#x2026;.</small> It also says (in Hos. 14:5 [4]): <small>I WILL HEAL THEIR APOSTASY</small> [<small>AND LOVE THEM VOLUNTARILY</small>]. What is the meaning of <small>AND LOVE THEM VOLUNTARILY</small>? My soul has volunteered to love them, even though they were not worthy; and so it says (in Deut. 7:8): <small>BECAUSE THE LORD LOVES YOU&#x2026;.</small></p>
<title>3.5 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part V</title>
<p>It is written (in Is. 2:2): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT IN THE LATTER DAYS THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED &#x003C;AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> This text is related (to Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>), <small>&#x003C;YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;This verse is here&#x003E; to teach you that everyone who is troubled (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>) from his beginning has rest at his end. You have no one who was more troubled (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>) than Abraham, who was cast into a fiery furnace and went into exile from his ancestral home. Moreover, sixteen kings oppressed him. He also stood the test of ten trials and buried Sarah. Yet in the end he had rest. (Gen. 24:1) <small>NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS, AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM &#x003C;IN ALL THINGS&#x003E;</small>. Isaac was troubled (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>) in his youth, for the Philistines were jealous of him, [as stated] (in Gen. 26:16): <small>AND ABIMELECH SAID UNTO ISAAC: GO AWAY FROM US, FOR YOU HAVE BECOME HAVE BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR US</small>. In the end they begged him for mercy, [as stated] (in vs. 27): <small>AND ISAAC SAID UNTO THEM: WHY HAVE YOU COME UNTO ME&#x2026;</small>. Jacob also was troubled (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>) in his youth, as stated (in Ps. 129:1): <small>THEY HAVE HARASSED ME GREATLY FROM MY YOUTH, LET ISRAEL NOW SAY</small>. While he was in his mothers belly, Esau wanted to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22): <small>BUT THE CHILDREN STRUGGLED WITHIN HER&#x2026;</small>. [Moreover, when he received the blessings, (according to Gen. 27:41:) <small>THEN ESAU HATED JACOB &#x2026;, AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: &#x003C;LET THE DAYS OF MOURNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&#x003E;</small>. So he fled to Laban and was troubled (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2019;<italic><small>R</small></italic>) over his daughter, and after that Laban wanted to kill him, as stated (in Deut. 26:5): <small>AN ARAMEAN WOULD HAVE DESTROYED MY ANCESTOR</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1232">13</xref></sup> He went away from him and encountered Esau, as stated (in Gen. 33:1): <small>NOW JACOB RAISED HIS EYES AND SAW ESAU COMING&#x2026;</small>. There came upon him the trouble over Dinah and the trouble over Joseph. Yet in the end he had rest, [as stated] (in Gen. 47:12): <small>AND JOSEPH SUSTAINED HIS FATHER &#x003C;AND HIS BROTHERS&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Ergo (in Job 8:7): <small>THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING</small> (rt.: <italic><small>T</small>s</italic>&#x2018;<italic><small>R</small></italic>), <small>&#x003C;YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>3.6 Deuteronomy 7:12ff, Part VI</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Is. 2:2): <small>&#x003C;THAT IN THE LATTER DAYS&#x003E; THE MOUNTAIN OF THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SHALL BE ESTABLISHED &#x003C; AS THE HIGHEST OF THE MOUNTAINS&#x003E;&#x2026;.</small> And Mount Tabor shall become very tall.<sup><xref rid="fn1233">14</xref></sup> A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the palace<sup><xref rid="fn1234">15</xref></sup> children of a king. They went down from the city and killed lions, tigers, and bears in the forest. Then they brought them and hung them opposite the city gate, so that all the people in the city were amazed. Who killed those lions? The Holy One, blessed be he,<sup><xref rid="fn1235">16</xref></sup> did so. Sisera came against Israel on Mount Tabor. (According to Jud. 5:20): <small>THE STARS FOUGHT FROM THE HEAVENS; &#x003C;FROM THEIR COURSES THEY FOUGHT WITH SISERA&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">17</xref></sup> All began to be amazed, for there had never been an event like this, when the stars came down from the heavens to make war with flesh and blood. The Holy One said: In this world the stars have fought on your behalf, but in the world to come, (according to Zech. 14:3&#x2013;4) <small>THEN THE LORD WILL COME FORTH AND FIGHT WITH THOSE NATIONS &#x003C;AS WHEN HE FIGHTS IN THE DAY OF BATTLE&#x003E;. AND HIS FEET SHALL STAND &#x003C;IN THAT DAY UPON THE MOUNT OF OLIVES&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And &#x003C;so on through&#x003E; all that section (of Zechariah). Then everyone will point him out with the finger, as stated (in Is. 25:9): <small>IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US. THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM. LET US REJOICE AND BE GLAD IN HIS SALVATION</small>.</p>

<title>4.1 Deuteronomy, 11:26ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 11:26:) <small>SEE, I &#x003C;AM SETTING BEFORE YOU TODAY A BLESSING AND A CURSE&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 21:8): <small>AND</small> &#x007B;<small>TO</small>&#x007D; [<small>UNTO</small>] <small>THIS PEOPLE YOU SHALL SAY: THUS SAYS THE LORD: SEE, I AM SETTING BEFORE YOU THE ROAD TO LIFE AND THE ROAD TO DEATH</small>. It is also written (in Ps. 78:1): <small>A MASKIL</small> &#x007B;<small>OF ETHAN THE EZRAHITE</small>&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1237">1</xref></sup> [<small>OF ASAPH</small>]. <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1238">2</xref></sup> And it is written (in Deut. 4:9&#x2013;10): <small>ONLY TAKE HEED TO YOURSELF &#x003C;AND WATCH YOURSELF CLOSELY, LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN AND LEST THEY DEPART FROM YOUR HEART ALL THE DAYS OF YOUR LIFE; MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND TO YOUR CHILDREN&#x2019;S CHILDREN</small> &#x003E;: <small>THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB&#x2026;.</small> &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to tell you that &#x003C;when&#x003E; anyone despises the words of Torah, it is as though he were denying the Holy One, because he only bestowed Torah so that Israel would be occupied with it day and night, as stated (in Josh. 1:8): <small>AND YOU SHALL MEDITATE ON IT</small> (i.e., on Torah) <small>DAY AND NIGHT</small>. And it is written (in Ps. 1:2): <small>BUT THEIR DELIGHT IS IN THE LAW</small> (<italic>Torah</italic>) <small>OF THE LORD, &#x003C;AND ON HIS LAW</small> (<italic>Torah</italic>) <small>THEY MEDITATE DAY AND NIGHT&#x003E;</small>. So when anyone occupies himself with the Torah and fulfills it, &#x003C;it is&#x003E; as though he had received it from Sinai. It is therefore written (in Deut. 4:9&#x2013;10): <small>MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN &#x2026;: THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD&#x2026;.</small> When Asaph came, he began to say (in Ps. 78:1) <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH&#x2026;</small>. So also did Solomon say (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION; DO NOT ABANDON MY TORAH</small>. Israel said to Asaph: Is there another torah of which you say (in Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>? We have already received it from Sinai. He said to them: The schismatics of Israel say that the Prophets and the Writings are not Torah, and we do not believe in them, as stated (in Dan. 9:10): <small>AND WE HAVE NOT OBEYED THE VOICE OF THE LORD OUR GOD BY WALKING IN HIS TORAH, WHICH HE SET BEFORE US AT THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS</small>. Ergo, The Prophets and the Writings are Torah, as stated (in Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small> (in this case to a writing of Asaph).</p>
<title>4.2 Deuteronomy, 11:26ff, Part II</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 78:1): <small>GIVE EAR, O MY PEOPLE, TO MY TORAH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 16:23): [<small>THE HEART OF</small>] <small>A WISE PERSON, INSTRUCTS HIS MOUTH&#x2026;</small>. When Israel sinned, they were withheld from anything good; and so you find that, when they committed the act (of the golden calf), everything good was withheld from them, as stated (in Exod. 32:19): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT AS SOON AS THEY DREW NEAR UNTO THE CAMP AND SAW THE CALF &#x003C;AND THE DANCING, MOSES BURNED WITH ANGER; SO HE THREW DOWN THE TABLETS FROM HIS HANDS AND SHATTERED THEM AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN&#x003E;</small>. Then when Moses sought mercy for them, the Holy One said to him: Moses, I created the world only for Torah, as stated (in Is. 51:16): <small>MOREOVER, I HAVE PUT MY WORDS</small> (i.e., the Torah) <small>IN YOUR MOUTH &#x2026;, &#x003C;SO THAT I MAY PLANT THE HEAVENS AND LAY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE EARTH&#x003E;</small>.

He said to him: What shall I do? He said to him (in Deut. 10:11): <small>CARVE OUT TWO TABLETS OF STONE LIKE THE FIRST ONES</small>. It is therefore written (in Prov. 16:23) [<small>THE HEART OF</small>] <small>A WISE PERSON, INSTRUCTS HIS MOUTH&#x2026;</small>. For that reason, when Asaph was alive, he mentioned above (in Ps. 77:21 [20]): <small>YOU LED YOUR PEOPLE LIKE A FLOCK BY THE HAND OF MOSES AND AARON</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1240">4</xref></sup> Then after that (in Ps. 78:1): <small>A MASKIL OF ASAPH</small>.</p>
<title>4.3 Deuteronomy, 12:29ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 12:29:) <small>WHEN THE LORD GOD HAS CUT OFF THE GENTILES</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who planted a vineyard within his field, but within &#x003C;that field&#x003E; were great cedars and thorns.<sup><xref rid="fn1241">5</xref></sup> The king went and cut down the cedars and left the thorns. His servants said to him: Our Lord King, the thorns, which catch our clothes, you have left &#x003C;standing&#x003E;; but you have cut down the cedars&#x0021; He said to them: If I had left the cedars and cut down the thornbushes, how should I have &#x007B;decreed&#x007D; [fenced in] my vineyard. So also Israel is the vineyard of the Holy One, as stated (in Is. 5:7): <small>FOR THE VINEYARD OF THE LORD OF HOSTS IS THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL</small>. He brought Israel into the land and cut down the cedars that were in it, as stated (in Amos 2:9): <small>YET I DESTROYED THE AMORITES</small> [<small>BEFORE YOU, WHOSE STATURE WAS LIKE THE CEDARS IN HEIGHT</small>]; but he left their children and their children&#x2019;s children so that Israel would observe the Torah, as stated (in Jud. 3:1): <small>NOW THESE ARE THE NATIONS WHICH THE LORD LEFT TO TEST ISRAEL</small>. So when the vineyard stands in its place in the service of the Torah, <small>THEN</small> (according to Is. 33:12) <small>THE PEOPLES SHALL BECOME BURNINGS OF LIME, THORNS CUT DOWN &#x003C;THAT ARE BURNED IN THE FIRE&#x003E;</small>. It is also written (in Is. 40:17): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE AS NOTHING BEFORE HIM</small>. Look at how many hosts<sup><xref rid="fn1242">6</xref></sup> Pharaoh sent out after Israel&#x0021; When Israel saw them, they were terrified before them and said: Who can stand against these? The Holy One said to them: By your lives, all these are as unimportant before me as &#x003C;if they were&#x003E; [only] a single horse, as stated (in Exod. 15:19): <small>WHEN THE HORSE</small> (in the singular) <small>OF PHARAOH CAME</small>; they all died in a single breath (rt.: <italic><small>NS</small>h<small>P</small></italic>), as stated (in Exod. 15:10): <small>YOU BLEW</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NS</small>h<small>P</small></italic>) <small>WITH YOUR WIND, &#x003C;AND THE SEA COVERED THEM&#x003E;</small>. Similarly Gog and Magog are going to come against Israel, but the Holy One will carry out judgments against them (literally: against him), as stated (in Ezek. 38:22): <small>I WILL ENTER INTO JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM WITH PESTILENCE AND WITH BLOOD&#x2026;.</small> At that time (according to Ezek. 38:23): <small>SO I WILL BE MAGNIFIED, BE SANCTIFIED, AND BE MADE KNOWN BEFORE THE EYES OF MANY</small> &#x007B;<small>PEOPLES</small>&#x007D; [<small>NATIONS</small>]; <small>AND THEY SHALL KNOW THAT I AM THE LORD</small>.</p>

<p>(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.

R.

<p>(Gen. 23:15:) <small>MY LORD, LISTEN TO ME. WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME</small>? He said to him: If you want to give me four hundred <italic>centenarii</italic> of silver from the goods &#x007B;another reading is <italic>hervata,</italic> which is construed as &#x201C;dung&#x201D; in the &#x2018;<italic>Arukh</italic>&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1247">11</xref></sup> of your house, you can give it to me.

<title>4.5 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part II</title>
<p>Rabbi Ammi interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to one who borrows a cow. Since he was too miserly to rent two cows, he borrowed one and rented one. <small>AND</small> (according to Prov. 28:22) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>, that it is written (in Exod. 22:13 [14]): <small>&#x003C;WHEN SOMEONE BORROWS AN ANIMAL FROM HIS NEIGHBOR AND IT IS INJURED OR DIES</small>, &#x007B;<small>IF</small>&#x007D; <small>ITS OWNER IS NOT WITH IT, HE SHALL SURELY PAY</small>.</p>
<title>4.6 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part III</title>
<p>Rabbi Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest. (Prov. 8:22) <small>HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY WILL COME TO HIM</small>, that it is written (in Prov. 28:8): <small>THE ONE WHO AUGMENTS HIS WEALTH BY INTEREST AND USURY AMASSES IT FOR ONE WHO IS GENEROUS TO THE POOR</small>. Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the Wicked. Is Esau the Wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators<sup><xref rid="fn1249">13</xref></sup> who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say: Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good work for them. [The &#x003C;Aramaic&#x003E; adage] says: &#x003C;She&#x003E; commits adultery for apples, and distributes to the sick, &#x007B;which means &#x003C;in Hebrew&#x003E;: The harlot buys apples and distributes to the sick&#x007D;.<sup><xref rid="fn1250">14</xref></sup></p>
<title>4.7 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end Rabbi Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly. Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes. From the remainder he and the children of his household sustained<sup><xref rid="fn1251">15</xref></sup> themselves. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him: My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such &#x003C;a number of&#x003E; measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself all my days. When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it a for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten &#x003C;measures from the tithe&#x003E;, but &#x003C;the field&#x003E; subtracted one hundred &#x003C;measures from its yield&#x003E;. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth &#x003C;years&#x003E;, until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw &#x003C;what was happening&#x003E;, they put on white (i.e., festive) &#x003C;tunics&#x003E; and wrapped themselves in white &#x003C;mantles&#x003E;. &#x003C;When&#x003E; they came to him, he said to them: Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who is afflicted? They said: Heaven forbid&#x0021; We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One was the priest; but now the Holy One has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest. For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.</p>
<title>4.8 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part V</title>
<p>(Ps. 37:3:) <small>TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD; SETTLE THE LAND AND MAINTAIN FIDELITY</small>. R. Haggai said in the name of R. Isaac: Interpret this verse by transposition.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">16</xref></sup> <small>DO GOOD; TRUST IN THE LORD</small>. It is comparable to a market commissioner who went out to inspect the measures. When a certain person saw him, he began hiding from him. He said to him: Why are you hiding from me? Look to your measures, and do not be afraid. This is what is written: <small>TRUST IN THE LORD AND DO GOOD</small>. [<small>SETTLE THE LAND AND MAINTAIN FIDELITY</small>. Bring about the settlement of the land. Sow, plant, and maintain ancestral fidelity.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">17</xref></sup> It is so written (in Ps. 101:6): <small>MY EYES ARE ON THE FAITHFUL OF THE LAND &#x003C;THAT THEY MAY DWELL WITH ME&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<p>R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi: Israel atoned for itself before the Omnipresent by merit from &#x003C;observing&#x003E; two commandments, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; by merit from the Sabbath and by merit from tithes: By merit from the Sabbath, since it is written (in Is. 58:13): <small>IF YOU REFRAIN FROM TRAMPLING THE SABBATH&#x2026;</small>. What is written after it (in vs. 14)? <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN THE LORD&#x2026;</small>. By merit from tithes, since it is written (in Deut. 26:11): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN EVERYTHING GOOD</small>;<sup><xref rid="fn1254">18</xref></sup> and there is nothing as good as Torah, since it is written (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION; &#x003C;DO NOT ABANDON MY TORAH&#x003E;</small>. For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.</p>
<title>4.9 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Prov. 3:9:) <small>HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR SUBSTANCE AND WITH THE FIRST FRUITS OF ALL YOUR PRODUCE</small>.

For that reason, <small>HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR SUBSTANCE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1255">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 3:9): [<small>HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR SUBSTANCE</small>.] If your voice is pleasant, recite the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018;, and cross over before the Ark (to lead in the recitation), because of &#x003C;the teaching&#x003E;, <small>HONOR THE LORD WITH YOUR SUBSTANCE</small>, [with whatever he has endowed you].</p>

<p>There is a story about a person who amassed wine and oil but did not take out his tithes properly. What did the Holy One do to him? He put a squally windy &#x007B;i.e., an evil spirit&#x007D; in him, so that he took a staff and began to smash the &#x003C;wine and oil&#x003E; jars. His steward rebuked him. What did he do to him? He took the staff and cracked him on his head. He said to him: Instead of helping me, you&#x2014;.

<p>R. Levi said: There is a story about a person who took out his tithes properly. Now he had a certain field, and the Holy One gave him a mind to prepare half of it for sowing and half as storage place for water.

[Take away from them the four firstborn (of Jacob&#x2019;s four wives),] since the firstborn is not tithed. Why? Because he is holy, and something holy does not redeem for use something &#x003C;else that is&#x003E; holy. He said to him: It is good for your people that you are among them.

Aha [bar Ulla] said: Is there Torah within the belly? And is it not so written (in Jer. 31:33): <small>AND UPON THEIR HEART</small> (not their belly) <small>I WILL WRITE IT</small>? It is simply that David said: May a curse come upon me, if something goes down into my belly, except when it is tithed.

Is this the work of your hand? Then R. Simeon ben Halafta said: It is comparable to one who had a bondmaid for sale in the bazaar. When someone passed by and saw her, he said: She is mine. He said to him: Rebuke her. If she heeds you, she is yours; but if not she is not yours. Similarly the Holy One said to Job: It is written of me (in Ps. 104:32): <small>WHO</small> (i.e., the <small>LORD</small>) <small>LOOKS ON THE EARTH AND IT TREMBLES</small>. Yet you say (in Job 31:38): <small>IF MY LAND CRIES OUT AGAINST ME</small>. Is this the work of your hand? At that time Job said: Sovereign of the Universe: I did not mean that.

It is simply that Job meant: If I have not fulfilled these &#x003C;conditions&#x003E; (of vss. 38&#x2013;39), may my words be ended, and let me not have a pretext for saying to you (in Deut. 26:13 regarding the second tithe): <small>I HAVE REMOVED THE CONSECRATED PORTION FROM THE HOUSE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1272">36</xref></sup> For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.</p>
<title>4.14 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part XI</title>
<p>(Dan. 9:7:) <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT THERE IS A SHAMEFUL FACE WITH US, TO THIS VERY DAY, WITH THE PEOPLE OF JUDAH &#x003C;AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM, WITH ALL ISRAEL&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. R. Judah bar Il&#x2019;ay said:<sup><xref rid="fn1273">37</xref></sup> An idol (&#x2018;<italic>avodah zarah</italic>) crossed the sea along with Israel, as stated (in Zech. 10:11): <small>A RIVAL WIFE</small> (<italic>tsarah</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1274">38</xref></sup> <small>SHALL CROSS IN THE SEA</small>. <italic>Tsarah</italic> can only mean an idolatrous work, since it is stated (in Is. 28:20): <small>AND THE MOLTEN IMAGE WAS A RIVAL WIFE AS WHEN ONE GATHERS ONESELF</small> (in the same bed).<sup><xref rid="fn1275">39</xref></sup> So the sea was rent asunder before them. Ergo (in Dan. 9:7): <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. R. Judan said: It is written (in Jud. 1:22): <small>THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH, FOR THEIR PART, WENT UP AGAINST BETHEL, AND THE LORD WAS WITH THEM</small>. They were going to serve an idol, [yet you say:] <small>AND THE LORD WAS WITH THEM</small>. Ergo (in Dan. 9:7): <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. R. Judah b. R. Simon said: (Jud. 18:27): <small>THEY TOOK THAT WHICH MICAH HAD MADE</small>, [i.e.,] the idol images, <small>AND THE PRIEST THAT HE HAD</small>, [i.e.,] the idolatrous priest, <small>AND CAME</small> &#x007B;<small>UNTO</small>&#x007D; [<small>TO</small>] <small>LAISH&#x2026;</small>. They conducted an idolatrous worship, and it brought them luck.<sup><xref rid="fn1276">40</xref></sup> And not only that, but they took some of the manna and offered it to idols, as stated (in Ezek. 16:19): <small>ALSO MY BREAD, WHICH I GAVE YOU, FINE FLOUR, OIL, AND HONEY WHICH I HAD YOU EAT, YOU SET IT BEFORE THEM AS A PLEASING ODOR; AND SO IT WAS, SAYS THE LORD</small>. What is the meaning of <small>AND SO IT WAS</small> (<italic>wayehi</italic>)? R. Judan said: It is just as you say: And it came to pass (<italic>wayehi</italic>) on the morrow, nevertheless (in Neh. 9:20): <small>AND YOU DID NOT WITHHOLD YOUR MANNA FROM THEIR MOUTH</small>. Ergo (in Dan. 9:7): <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>.</p>
<title>4.15 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part XII</title>
<p>[(Dan. 9:7:) <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>. R. Eleazar said: Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah spoke this verse while in the fiery furnace. You find that when Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah came up from the fiery furnace, all the kings of the peoples of the world assembled.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">41</xref></sup> This is what is written (in Dan. 3:27): <small>THE SATRAPS, THE PREFECTS, THE GOVERNORS, AND THE ROYAL COMPANIONS ASSEMBLED. THEY SAW THOSE MEN&#x2026;</small>. Then all the peoples of the world said to them: You know that there is power in your God to perform all these miracles for you; yet you have caused him to destroy his house and exile his children. So all the peoples of the world spat before them (literally: into their faces), until they had produced a mass of spittle. Then Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah raised their faces toward heaven and said (in Dan. 9:7): <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, BUT THERE IS A SHAMEFUL FACE WITH US</small>. R. Joshua bar Nehemiah said: <small>WITH YOU, O LORD, THERE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>, i.e., the righteousness of the judgment; <small>BUT THERE IS A SHAMEFUL FACE WITH US</small>, because we have provoked you so many times with you enduring us.</p>
<p>Thus is it taught in the name of R. Hanina: By universal custom, if someone has a certain field, he may let it out for a third or a quarter &#x003C;of its yield&#x003E;; but it is not like that with the Holy One. He causes the wind to blow, clouds to rise, rains to descend, dews to flourish, plants to grow, and fruits to become plump; yet he only says to separate out one tenth. For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.</p>
<title>4.16 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part XIII</title>
<p>[(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.] What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 14:21)? <small>YOU SHALL EAT NO CARCASS THAT IS NOT PROPERLY SLAUGHTERED&#x2026;</small>. R. &#x2018;Azariah, R. Johanan ben Haggai, and R. Isaac bar Maryon said in the name or Rabbi Jose bar Hanina: One who eats his produce untithed is like one who eats carcasses that are not properly slaughtered and those torn by wild beasts (<italic>terefah</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1278">42</xref></sup> What is the reason? (Deut. 14:21:) <small>YOU SHALL EAT NO CARCASS THAT IS NOT PROPERLY SLAUGHTERED</small>. [&#x003C;Then after that it is written (in vs. 22):&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1279">43</xref></sup> <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>.] R. Abba and Rav Huna said in the name of Rav: One who eats his produce without separating the tithe for the poor is liable for death.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">44</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: It is written in three places: <small>YOU SHALL NOT BOIL A KID IN ITS MOTHER</small>&#x2019;s <small>MILK</small>: One for its own sake, one with reference to Torah, and one with reference to tithes.<sup><xref rid="fn1281">45</xref></sup> &#x003C;Where the prohibition is given&#x003E; for its own sake, what does it say (in Exod. 23:19)? <small>THE CHOICE FIRST FRUITS OF YOUR LAND &#x003C;YOU SHALL BRING TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>.&#x003E; [<small>YOU SHALL NOT BOIL A KID IN ITS MOTHER</small>&#x2019;s <small>MILK</small>.] What is written after that (in vs. 20): <small>BEHOLD, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU &#x003C;TO GUARD YOU ON THE WAY&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">46</xref></sup> With reference to Torah, [what is written] (in Exod. 34:26)? <small>THE CHOICE</small> [<small>FIRST FRUITS OF YOUR LAND</small>] <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL BRING TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD.&#x003E; YOU SHALL NOT BOIL A KID IN ITS MOTHER&#x2019;</small>s <small>MILK</small>.] What is written after it (in vs. 27)? <small>AND THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: WRITE DOWN &#x003C;THESE WORDS&#x003E;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">47</xref></sup> [The Holy One said to Moses: While the sandal<sup><xref rid="fn1284">48</xref></sup> is on your foot, tread down the thorn<sup><xref rid="fn1285">49</xref></sup> &#x003C;of opposition&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">50</xref></sup> Out of <small>YOU SHALL NOT BOIL A KID IN ITS MOTHER</small>&#x2019;s <small>MILK</small> &#x003C;comes&#x003E; <small>WRITE DOWN THESE WORDS</small>.] With reference to tithes (in Deut. 14:22) what is written above (ibid.)? <small>YOU SHALL EAT NO CARCASS THAT IS NOT PROPERLY SLAUGHTERED</small> [&#x2026;. <small>YOU SHALL NOT BOIL</small> (<italic><small>BS</small>h<small>L</small></italic>) <small>A KID</small> (<italic>gedi</italic>) <small>IN ITS MOTHER&#x2019;S MILK</small> (<italic><small>HLB</small></italic>).] Then after that is written (in Deut. 14:22): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE</small>. The Holy One said: Do not cause me to have the tender grains (<italic>gedayim</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1287">51</xref></sup> ripen prematurely (<italic><small>BS</small>h<small>L</small></italic>) in the fat (<italic><small>HLB</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1288">52</xref></sup> of their mothers, while they are in the abdominal fat (<italic><small>HLB</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1289">53</xref></sup> of their mothers (i.e., in their pods).<sup><xref rid="fn1290">54</xref></sup> Thus unless you take out a tithe properly, I will send out a certain wind from the East to blast them (i.e., the tender grains), just as you have said (in II Kings 19:26 &#x003D; Is. 37:27): <small>AND BLASTED BEFORE IT IS GROWN</small>.</p>
<title>4.17 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part XIV</title>
<p>(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE &#x003C;ALL&#x003E;</small>. Tithe (&#x2018;<italic><small>SR</small></italic>) so that you may become rich (&#x2018;<italic>Sh<small>R</small></italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1291">55</xref></sup> before you are in want.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">56</xref></sup> &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a hint (<italic>remez</italic>) for those who sail the seas to take out one tenth for those who labor in Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1293">57</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE PRODUCE OF YOUR SEED THAT COMES &#x003C;YEAR BY YEAR&#x003E; FROM THE FIELD</small>. If you are virtuous &#x003C;in tithing&#x003E;, you shall &#x003C;continue&#x003E; going out to sow a field. If not, the one who goes out to the field shall in the end engage in combat with you. This refers to Esau, of whom it is said &#x007B;(in Gen. 25:29): <small>THEN ESAU CAME FROM THE FIELD</small>. [(in Gen. 25:27): <small>A CUNNING HUNTER, A MAN OF THE FIELD</small>.]</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 14:22): <small>THE PRODUCE OF YOUR SEED</small>. If you are virtuous &#x003C;in tithing&#x003E;, your end shall be that, when to go out to your field and see the world in need of rain, you shall pray and be answered.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">58</xref></sup> If not, it ends up that the enemies of Israel come out to bury their children in the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1295">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YEAR BY YEAR</small>. One does not set aside a tithe from one year for &#x003C;the crops of&#x003E; another.<sup><xref rid="fn1296">60</xref></sup> &#x003C;These are&#x003E; the words of R. Aqiva. (Deut. 14:23:) <small>THEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LORD YOUR GOD, IN THE PLACE WHERE HE SHALL CHOOSE TO HAVE HIS NAME DWELL, YOU SHALL CONSUME THE TITHES OF YOUR GRAIN, YOUR NEW WINE&#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> If you are virtuous &#x003C;in tithing, it is&#x003E; your grain. If not, &#x003C;it is&#x003E; my grain, according to what is stated (in Hos. 2:11 [9]): <small>THEREFORE I WILL TAKE BACK MY GRAIN IN ITS TIME</small>. If you are virtuous &#x003C;in tithing, it is&#x003E; your new wine. If not, &#x003C;it is&#x003E; my new wine, [according to what is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND MY NEW WINE IN ITS SEASON</small>. Resh Laqesh said: [The Holy One said:] I have told you to take your tithes from the choicest part. How is this possible? When a child of Levi comes to you, if you give him some of the choicest part, I will also give to you some of the choicest part. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 28:12): <small>THE LORD WILL OPEN FOR YOU HIS FINEST STOREHOUSE</small>. If you have given him some sword grass and some pulse, I have a right to give you something similar. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 28:24): <small>THE LORD WILL MAKE THE RAINFALL OF YOUR LAND POWDER AND DUST&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 14:29:) <small>THEN THE LEVITE, BECAUSE HE HAS NO SHARE OR INHERITANCE &#x2026; SHALL COME&#x2026;</small>. R. Judah b. R. Simon said: The Holy One said: As for you, you have four children in the house, and I have four grandchildren. (According to Deut. 16:14:) <small>AND YOU SHALL REJOICE DURING YOUR FESTIVAL, YOU, AND YOUR SON, AND YOUR DAUGHTER, YOUR BOND SERVANT, AND YOUR BONDMAID</small>. &#x003C;These are&#x003E; yours. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>THE LEVITE AND THE SOJOURNER, THE ORPHAN AND THE WIDOW</small>. &#x003C;These are&#x003E; mine. So they all are in a single verse. If you give joy to mine during the festival days that I have given you, I will give joy to yours in the Temple (literally: in the house of your choosing). It is so stated (in Is. 56:7): <small>I WILL BRING THEM UNTO MY HOLY HILL AND GIVE THEM JOY IN MY HOUSE OF PRAYER&#x2026;</small>.</p>

When the angels had objected that Israel was unworthy to receive the Torah, the Holy One reminded them that, although any schoolchild knew never to mix meat and milk, the angels had done so when visiting Abraham (Gen. 18:8).

<p>This manuscript is described by Buber on pp. 143&#x2013;147 of his introduction.</p>
<title>4a.1 Deuteronomy, 14:22ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 14:22:) <small>YOU SHALL SURELY TITHE &#x003C;ALL&#x003E;</small>. Moses said: Sovereign of the World, does it follow from here that one takes out a tithe? The Holy One said to him (in Job 8:8, 10): <small>SO PLEASE ASK A FORMER GENERATION, AND CONFIRM THE RESEARCH OF THEIR ANCESTORS&#x2026;. WILL THEY NOT INSTRUCT YOU AND TELL YOU&#x2026;.</small>? How so? (I Chron. 1:1:) <small>ADAM, SETH, ENOSH</small>. From Adam up to Noah there are ten generations,<sup><xref rid="fn1297">1</xref></sup> and I took the tenth.<sup><xref rid="fn1298">2</xref></sup> From Noah to Abraham there are ten generations,<sup><xref rid="fn1299">3</xref></sup> and I took the tenth, which was Abraham. So it is therefore written (in Job 8:10): <small>WILL THEY NOT INSTRUCT YOU AND TELL YOU</small> to take out one tenth? (Deut. 15:20:) <small>YEAR BY YEAR</small>. If you have taken out a tithe during a given year, you gain merit for another year. R. Abba bar Kahana said: The importance of tithes is &#x003C;mentioned&#x003E; throughout all the Torah (in the Law, in the Prophets, and in the Writings). It is written (in Deut. 6:16): <small>DO NOT PUT THE LORD YOUR GOD TO THE TEST &#x003C;AS YOU PUT HIM TO THE TEST THROUGH A TAX</small> (<italic><small>MSH</small></italic>)&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">4</xref></sup> Also in reference to tithes it is written (in Mal. 3:10): [<small>BRING ALL THE TITHE &#x003C;INTO THE STOREHOUSE, THAT THERE MAY BE FOOD IN MY HOUSE&#x003E;</small>]. <small>SO PLEASE TEST ME IN THIS, &#x003C;SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS&#x003E;</small>. And who tested the tithes? The generation of Hezekiah, as stated (in II Chron. 31:9&#x2013;10): <small>THEN HEZEKIAH</small> &#x007B;<small>THE KING</small>&#x007D; <small>QUESTIONED &#x003C;THE PRIESTS AND THE LEVITES&#x003E; ABOUT THE HEAPS</small> (of produce). <small>SO THE CHIEF PRIEST AZARIAH OF THE HOUSE OF ZADOK SPOKE</small> [<small>UNTO HIM</small>] <small>&#x003C;AND SAID: EVER SINCE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BRING THE</small> <italic><small>TERUMAH</small></italic> (i.e., the priestly tithe on produce) <small>TO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD,&#x003E; WE HAVE EATEN</small> &#x007B;<small>AND HAVE DRUNK</small>&#x007D; [<small>AND HAVE BEEN SATISFIED</small>], <small>WHILE LEAVING OVER &#x003C;FOOD IN GREAT AMOUNTS&#x003E;</small>. Why? (Ibid., cont.:) <small>BECAUSE THE LORD HAS BLESSED HIS PEOPLE</small>. The Holy One said: In this world I have blessed one generation, but hereafter in the world to come, I am blessing &#x003C;all the generations of&#x003E; Israel, as stated (in Jer. 31:22 [23]): <small>AGAIN THEY SHALL SAY THIS THING</small> &#x007B;<small>ON THE MOUNTAIN OF THE LORD, IN JERUSALEM, AND IN ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH</small>&#x007D; [<small>IN THE LAND OF JUDAH AND ITS CITIES, WHEN I RESTORE THEM AS BEFORE</small>]: <small>MAY THE LORD BLESS YOU, O HABITATION OF</small> &#x007B;<small>RIGHTEOUS HOLINESS</small>&#x007D; [<small>RIGHTEOUSNESS</small>], <small>O HOLY MOUNTAIN</small>.</p>
<p>The End of the Supplement to Parashah <bold><italic>Re&#x2019;eh</italic></bold></p>
<ftnote id="fn1297">1. I.e., Adam, 2. Seth, 3. Enosh, 4. Kenan, 5. Mahalalel, 6. Jared, 7. Enoch, 8. Methuselah, 9. Lamech, and 10. Noah. See <italic>Tanh</italic>., Gen. 9:1; <italic>TDER</italic> (16), p. 80 (Friedmann).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298">2. Probably Noah (Gen. 6:9), but possibly Enoch (Gen. 5:21). See <italic>PRK</italic> 23:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299">3. I.e., 1. Noah, 2. Arpachshad, 3. Shelah, 4. Eber, 5. Peleg, 6. Reu, 7. Serug, 8. Nahor, 9. Terah, 10. Abraham.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1300">4. So the midrash understands this verse. Since Deut. 6:16 refers to an incident at Massah (<italic>MSH</italic>) in Exod. 17:1&#x2013;7, biblical translations render the bracketed clause to mean, <small>AS YOU PUT HIM TO THE TEST AT MASSAH</small>. Exod. 17:1&#x2013;7 also explains in vs. 7 that <small>MASSAH</small> means &#x201C;test.&#x201D; The midrash, however, either revowels MSH as <small>MISSAH</small>, a word which means &#x201C;tribute,&#x201D; &#x201C;contribution,&#x201D; or &#x201C;quota,&#x201D; in this case the tithe, or perhaps understands the name as a form of <italic>mas,</italic> which had come to mean &#x201C;tax.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 5 Deuteronomy, Parashah V: <italic>Shofetim</italic></title>
<title>5.1 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 16:18:) <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL APPOINT&#x003E; JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS &#x003C;FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small><sup><xref rid="fn1301">1</xref></sup> <small>WHICH THE LORD YOUR GOD IS GIVING YOU FOR YOUR TRIBES, SO THAT THEY MAY JUDGE THE PEOPLE WITH RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT&#x003E;</small>. This text is related (to Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL. HIS WORDS</small> are the words of Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1302">2</xref></sup> <small>HIS STATUTES</small> are the expositions (<italic>midrsahot</italic>), <small>AND HIS ORDINANCES</small> are the judgments [<small>TO ISRAEL</small>]. The Holy One gave the Torah and the judgments to no one but <small>TO ISRAEL</small> alone. And where is it shown? You learn that when Israel and a star-worshiping gentile have a dispute with each other, it is forbidden for Israel to say to the gentile (<italic>goy</italic>): Go with me to your courts,<sup><xref rid="fn1303">3</xref></sup> because he would be transgressing a prohibition, since it is stated (in Ps. 147:20): <small>HE HAS NOT DONE SO FOR ANY NATION</small> (<italic>goy</italic>); <small>AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM</small>. But were not the peoples of the world commanded concerning litigations, since that is one of the seven commandments of the children of Noah?<sup><xref rid="fn1304">4</xref></sup> So what is the significance of (Ibid.): <small>AND, AS FOR HIS ORDINANCES, THEY HAVE NOT KNOWN THEM</small>? These are the fine points of the law (<italic>din</italic>). So this is what we teach (in <italic>Sanh.</italic> 5:2): <small>ONCE UPON A TIME BEN ZAKKAY CROSS-EXAMINED &#x003C;WITNESSES&#x003E; ON FIG STEMS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1305">5</xref></sup> Now the children of Noah are put to death on the evidence of a single witness, with a single judge, and without a warning. &#x003C;That is&#x003E; something which does not exist in Israel, since there are three judges in property cases, and there are twenty-three judges in capital cases.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">6</xref></sup> Moreover, it is written (in Deut. 19:15): <small>A SINGLE WITNESS SHALL NOT BE VALID AGAINST A PERSON&#x2026;. &#x003C;ONLY&#x003E; ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO &#x003C;OR THREE&#x003E; WITNESSES &#x003C;SHALL A CASE BE VALID&#x003E;</small>. So there must be an investigation and an inquiry. How do they examine the witnesses? They bring them in and solemnly forewarn them. Then they would examine them again with seven inquiries:<sup><xref rid="fn1307">7</xref></sup> 1. In what week,<sup><xref rid="fn1308">8</xref></sup> 2. In what year? 3. in what month? 4. On what &#x003C;day&#x003E; of the month? 5. On what day (of the week)?<sup><xref rid="fn1309">9</xref></sup> 6. In what place? 7. Have you forewarned him?<sup><xref rid="fn1310">10</xref></sup> And so you find among the leaders<sup><xref rid="fn1311">11</xref></sup> of Israel that they were praised only for their judging.<sup><xref rid="fn1312">12</xref></sup> It is written concerning Samuel (in I Sam. 7:6): <small>AND HE WENT ON A CIRCUIT YEAR BY YEAR &#x003C;TO BETHEL, &#x003C;GILGAL, AND MIZPAH;&#x003E; AND HE JUDGED ISRAEL &#x003C;IN ALL THOSE PLACES&#x003E;</small>. And David also was praised only for his judging, as stated (in I Chron. 18:14 // II Sam. 8:15): <small>AND</small> &#x007B;<small>DAVID</small>&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1313">13</xref></sup> <small>ADMINISTERED JUDGMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TO ALL HIS PEOPLE</small>.</p>
<title>5.2 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part II</title>
<p>And in the case of Jehoshaphat also, when he was installed in the kingship, he did not occupy himself with the business of kingship nor with honor but with the business of judging.<sup><xref rid="fn1314">14</xref></sup> It is so stated (in II Chron. 17:1): [<small>THEN &#x003C;HIS SON&#x003E; JEHOSHAPHAT REIGNED</small>] <small>&#x003C;IN HIS STEAD,&#x003E; AND HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF OVER ISRAEL</small>. What is the meaning of [<small>AND HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HZQ</small></italic>)]? That <small>HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF</small>, when he appointed judges. It also says (in II Chron. 17:6): <small>HIS HEART WAS EXALTED IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD, AND IN ADDITION HE REMOVED THE HIGH PLACES AND ASHERIM FROM JUDAH</small>. Was there a haughty spirit within him, in that it says: <small>HIS HEART WAS EXALTED</small>? It is simply that he had appointed judges over them who knew how to walk <small>IN THE WAYS OF THE LORD</small><sup><xref rid="fn1315">15</xref></sup> <small>AND TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">16</xref></sup> (II Chron. 19:6&#x2013;7:) <small>THEN HE SAID UNTO THE JUDGES: CONSIDER WHAT YOU ARE DOING, SINCE YOU JUDGE NOT FOR HUMANS BUT FOR THE LORD. SO NOW LET THE FEAR OF THE LORD BE UPON YOU. TAKE CARE WHEN YOU ACT, FOR WITH THE LORD OUR GOD THERE IS NO INJUSTICE, PARTIALITY, OR TAKING A BRIBE</small>. Now if Moses our Master, who was not commanded concerning Judges,&#x2014;rather Jethro told him (in Exod. 18:21): <small>YOU SHALL SEEK OUT &#x003C;ABLE MEN&#x003E; FROM AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE&#x2026;</small>, &#x2014;&#x003C;if he&#x003E; convened a sanhedrin<sup><xref rid="fn1317">17</xref></sup> for Israel, how much more &#x003C;important is a sanhedrin&#x003E; in our case, when it has been commanded here in the Torah (in Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS FOR YOURSELVES</small>. Where is it shown that Moses convened a sanhedrin? Where it is stated (in Exod. 18:25): <small>SO MOSES CHOSE ABLE MEN FROM ALL ISRAEL &#x003C;AND APPOINTED THEM AS HEADS OVER THE PEOPLE&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And Jerusalem also was praised only because of the justice system, as stated (in Ezek. 16:14): <small>AND YOUR NAME SHALL BE SPREAD AMONG THE GENTILES BECAUSE OF YOUR BEAUTY</small>. And what adornment (rt.: <italic><small>HDR</small></italic>) is that? This is the justice system, since it is stated (in Exod. 23:3): <small>NOR SHALL YOU FAVOR</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HDR</small></italic>) <small>SOMEONE POOR IN HIS LAWSUIT</small>. And Jerusalem was destroyed only over perversion of justice, since it is stated (in Ezek. 22:5): <small>YOU WITH A BESMIRCHED NAME; YOU WHO ARE FULL OF COMMOTION</small>. A name for justice that you had at first is besmirched. It is also written (in Is. 1:21): <small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>WAS FULL OF JUSTICE</small>; but Jeremiah said this to them (in Lam. 4:12&#x2013;13): <small>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH DID NOT BELIEVE</small>, [ &#x2026; ] <small>&#x003C;THAT FOE OR ENEMY WOULD COME THROUGH THE GATES OF JERUSALEM&#x003E;. IT WAS FOR THE SINS OF HER PROPHETS AND THE INIQUITIES OF HER PRIESTS &#x003C;WHO SHED THE BLOOD OF THE RIGHTEOUS IN HER MIDST&#x003E;</small>. At that time the Holy One swore that he himself would exact retribution from them and from their judges, as stated (in Is. 1:24): <small>THEREFORE THUS SAYS THE LORD, THE LORD OF HOSTS, THE MOST MIGHTY OF ISRAEL: &#x003C;AH, I WILL EXACT VENGEANCE FROM MY FOES&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. Now <small>THEREFORE</small> can only be a term &#x003C;related to&#x003E; an oath, since it is stated (in I Sam. 3:14): <small>AND I THEREFORE SWEAR TO THE HOUSE OF ELI</small>. Moreover, <small>MIGHTY</small> can only be a term for the <italic>Av bet Din,</italic> since it is stated (in I Sam. 21:8 [7]): <small>THE MOST MIGHTY OF THE SHEPHERDS THAT BELONG TO SAUL</small>. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach you that the Holy One became an <italic>Av bet Din</italic> in order to exact vengeance from them. And where is it shown? Where the text speaks about judges. See what is written after it (in Is. 1:26): <small>AND I WILL RESTORE YOUR JUDGES AS IN THE BEGINNING</small>. Therefore David has said (in Ps. 147:19): <small>HE DECLARES HIS WORDS TO JACOB, &#x003C;HIS STATUTES AND HIS ORDINANCES TO ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>5.3 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 16:18:) <small>&#x003C;YOU SHALL APPOINT&#x003E; JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS &#x003C;FOR YOURSELVES&#x003E;: JUDGES</small> operate in courts, and <small>LAW OFFICERS</small> operate in the community.<sup><xref rid="fn1318">18</xref></sup> R. Eleazar said: If there is no law officer, there is no judge. How so? When someone is found by a court to have a legal obligation to his companion, if there is no law officer who will collect from him when he withdraws from the judges, there is no power in the hands of the judge to do anything to him. If, however, &#x003C;a law officer is present&#x003E;, he delivers him into the hand of the law officer, and the law officer extracts compliance from him. R. Eleazar ben Pedat said: If it had not been for the law-enforcing office<sup><xref rid="fn1319">19</xref></sup> of Joab, David could not have enforced justice. And so it says (in I Chron. 18:14&#x2013;15 // II Sam. 8:15&#x2013;16): <small>SO</small> &#x007B;<small>DAVID</small>&#x007D;<sup><xref rid="fn1320">20</xref></sup> <small>ADMINISTERED JUDGMENT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TO ALL HIS PEOPLE, WHILE JOAB BEN ZERUIAH WAS OVER THE ARMY</small>. Were David and Joab judges? It is simply that whenever someone did not heed the judge, they delivered him into the hands of Joab, and he extracted compliance from him against his will. And so Joab said (in Job 29:16&#x2013;17): <small>I WAS A FATHER TO THE POOR&#x2026;. I BROKE THE JAWS OF THE EVILDOER</small>.</p>
<title>5.4 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 16:18:) <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT &#x003C;JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&#x003E; FOR YOURSELVES</small>, and not for the peoples of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">21</xref></sup> Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT &#x003C;JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&#x003E; FOR YOURSELVES</small>. &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that the judges were called in the name of Moses. Moreover, this is one of three things over which Moses risked his life and were called by his name.<sup><xref rid="fn1322">22</xref></sup> He offered his life over the Torah, [as stated (in Exod. 34:28): <small>AND HE WAS THERE &#x003C;WITH THE LORD&#x003E; FORTY DAYS AND FORTY NIGHTS; &#x003C;HE ATE NO BREAD AND DRANK NO WATER&#x003E;</small>.] It was also called by his name, as stated (in Mal. 3:22 [4:4]): <small>REMEMBER &#x003C;THE&#x003E; TORAH OF MY SERVANT MOSES</small>. He offered his life over Israel, as stated (in Exod. 32:32): <small>BUT NOW, IF YOU WILL FORGIVE THEIR SIN, &#x003C;WELL AND GOOD;&#x003E; BUT IF NOT, PLEASE BLOT ME OUT &#x003C;OF THE BOOK THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN</small> &#x003E;. And where is it shown that they were called by his Name? Where it is stated (in Exod. 32:7, in which the Holy One tells Moses): <small>FOR YOUR PEOPLE &#x003C;WHOM YOU BROUGHT UP FROM THE LAND OF EGYPT&#x003E; HAVE ACTED BASELY</small>. He also offered his life over the judges, as stated (in Exod. 2:12&#x2013;14): <small>HE SMOTE THE EGYPTIAN &#x003C;AND HID HIM IN THE SAND. WHEN HE WENT OUT ON THE SECOND DAY, HERE THERE WERE TWO HEBREW MEN FIGHTING&#x003E;; SO HE SAID TO THE WICKED ONE: WHY WOULD YOU STRIKE YOUR COMRADE</small>? <small>&#x003C;BUT HE SAID: WHO APPOINTED YOU</small><sup><xref rid="fn1323">23</xref></sup> <small>A PRINCE AND A JUDGE OVER US</small>?&#x003E; For that reason they were called in his name, as stated (in Deut. 16:18): <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small>.</p>
<title>5.5 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part V</title>
<p>[(Deut. 16:18:) <small>YOU SHALL APPOINT JUDGES AND LAW OFFICERS&#x003E; FOR YOURSELVES IN ALL YOUR GATES</small> &#x2026;,] in every single city, <small>FOR YOUR TRIBES</small>. Even when the whole city consists of a single family, appoint judges for yourselves.<sup><xref rid="fn1324">24</xref></sup> (Deut. 16:18, cont.:) <small>SO THAT THEY MAY JUDGE THE PEOPLE WITH RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT</small>. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach you that one effects righteousness with both of them, with the innocent one who gets what belongs to him and with the guilty one from under whose hand they take away the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:18): <small>RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT</small>. During the time that they judge righteously, they effect righteousness with the people, as stated (in Ps. 85:12 [11]): <small>FAITHFULNESS SHALL SPRING UP FROM THE LAND WHILE RIGHTEOUSNESS LOOKS DOWN FROM HEAVEN</small>. During the time that a faithful judgment springs up from the land, the Holy One effects righteousness with the people. He also saves them from divine punishment and afflictions, while good will comes into the world.</p>
<title>5.6 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Deut. 16:19:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE; YOU SHALL NOT SHOW PARTIALITY; &#x003C;YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A BRIBE, BECAUSE A BRIBE BLINDS THE EYES OF THE WISE&#x003E;</small>. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a warning for the prince not to place one suited to be low too high and one suited to be high too low.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE &#x003C;JUSTICE&#x003E;</small> because of wealth; <small>YOU SHALL NOT SHOW PARTIALITY</small> because of honor.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19). So that a poor person does not stand while a wealthy one sits.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE</small>. Let the judges always feel as if the Divine Presence is among them, as stated (in Ps. 82:1): <small>&#x003C;GOD STANDS IN THE DIVINE CONGREGATION;&#x003E; HE PRONOUNCES JUDGMENT IN THE MIDST OF GODS&#x2026;.</small> From here it follows for litigants that they conduct themselves in awe.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE JUSTICE</small>. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a warning for a wise person not to seat someone beside one who is unfit for jurisdiction. Moreover, if he should so seat someone, it is as though he had planted an Asherah. So near &#x003C;this verse&#x003E; is &#x003C;the following&#x003E; (in Deut. 16:21): <small>YOU SHALL NOT PLANT FOR YOURSELVES ANY TREE AS AN ASHERAH &#x003C;BESIDE AN ALTAR OF THE LORD YOUR GOD&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; There is a story about a certain person who had a lawsuit with a king, one of the kings of the Hasmonean dynasty.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">27</xref></sup> He came and stood before Simeon ben Shetah. He said to him: I have a lawsuit with the king. Simeon ben Shetah said to those judges who were judging along with him: If I send for the king, will you reprimand him? They told him: Yes. He sent for him. He came and put his throne beside Simeon ben Shetah. Simeon ben Shetah said to him: Stand on your feet and give satisfaction. He said to him: Are they judging the king? He turned to the right, and the judges &#x003C;on the right&#x003E; pressed their faces on the ground (to hide them). He turned to the left, and &#x003C; those on the left&#x003E; pressed their faces on the ground. The angel<sup><xref rid="fn1328">28</xref></sup> came and beat them on the ground, until their breath left them. Immediately the king trembled. Simeon ben Shetah said to him: Stand on your feet and give satisfaction, since you are not standing before us but before the one who spoke and the world came into being. He immediately stood on his feet and gave satisfaction. From here it follows that litigants conduct themselves in awe. They are rendering judgment, as it were, before the Holy One. Therefore Jehoshaphat said to the judges (in II Chron. 19:6): <small>CONSIDER</small> [<small>WHAT YOU ARE DOING</small>], <small>SINCE YOU ARE NOT RENDERING JUDGMENT FOR HUMANS BUT FOR THE LORD</small>. R. Hama bar Hanina said: Come and see&#x0021; If there it no scriptural text written, it is not possible for him to say that flesh and blood judges its creator. The Holy One said to the Judges: Let them conduct themselves in awe, as if you were judging me. How? One fulfills a commandment before me. I have decreed over him to give him a hundred fields. If you pass judgment against him on one thing that I have decreed over him, I will give him other &#x003C;fields&#x003E; from what I possess; and I will credit it against you as though you had gotten it from me.</p>
<title>5.7 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Deut. 16:19, cont.:) <small>YOU SHALL NOT TAKE A BRIBE</small>. When the judge sets his heart on a bribe, he becomes blind to justice and he is unable to judge &#x003C;a case&#x003E; honestly.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">29</xref></sup> R. Eleazar said: It says here (in Ezek. 22:6): <small>BEHOLD, THE PRINCES OF ISRAEL, EACH ONE ACCORDING TO HIS STRENGTH</small> (literally: <small>ARM</small>), <small>HAVE EXISTED AMONG YOU &#x003C;FOR THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD&#x003E;</small>. Thus they stretched out<sup><xref rid="fn1330">30</xref></sup> their arms under their robes to take a bribe. R. Abbahu said: Whoever takes the equivalent of a <italic>peruta</italic> (the smallest of coins) from his fellow is called wicked, as stated (in Prov. 17:23): [<small>A WICKED ONE</small>] <small>TAKES A CONCEALED BRIBE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1331">31</xref></sup> R. Ishmael ben Elisha said: Come and see how harmful a bribe is. One time a certain person came and brought me the first fruits of the sheep shearing.<sup><xref rid="fn1332">32</xref></sup> He also had a lawsuit before the judge, so I stood to one side. Now I said, &#x003C;to myself&#x003E;: If he pleads such and such before the judge, he will win the suit; for I was hoping for him to win. Even though he had only given me my due, and it was not a bribe, my heart was drawn to him every time I saw him. Furthermore, although had gone to the court, I asked about him whether he had won or not. &#x003C;This incident serves&#x003E; to make known to you how harmful a bribe is, since it makes the eyes blind. Now here is an argument <italic>a fortiori.</italic> If I, to whom he had &#x003C;only&#x003E; brought what was due and who &#x003C;only&#x003E; got what was due me, was hoping for him to win, how much the more so with one who gets a bribe.</p>
<p>Rabban Johanan ben Zakkay said: (Mal. 3:5:) <small>THEN I WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU IN JUDGMENT</small>; [<small>AND I WILL BE A SWIFT WITNESS AGAINST SORCERERS, AGAINST ADULTERERS, AGAINST THOSE WHO SWEAR TO A LIE, AGAINST THOSE WHO OPPRESS THE HIRED WORKER IN THEIR WAGES, THE WIDOW, THE ORPHAN AND THOSE WHO TURN ASIDE THE SOJOURNER</small>]. Woe to us for the day of judgment&#x0021; Woe to us for the day of retribution&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1333">33</xref></sup> Scripture compares (<italic>heqish</italic>) one who turns aside justice to all the worst transgressions. Therefore the Holy One warned (in Deut. 16:19): <small>YOU SHALL NOT TURN ASIDE &#x003C;JUSTICE&#x003E;</small>. R. Hama bar Osha&#x2019;ya said: A person having a pain in his eye gives a lot of money to a physician, &#x003C;when&#x003E; it is doubtful whether he is being healed or not.<sup><xref rid="fn1334">34</xref></sup> But the one who takes a bribe corrupts justice, makes her eyes blind, causes exile for Israel, and brings hunger into the world. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE AND POSSESS &#x003C;THE LAND&#x003E;</small>; and if not, you shall not possess it.</p>
<p>(Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE</small>, [&#x003C;with <small>JUSTICE</small> repeated&#x003E; two times]. From here they have maintained that one should pursue a worthy court.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of (Deut. 16:20): <small>JUSTICE, JUSTICE YOU SHALL PURSUE</small>, &#x003C;with <small>JUSTICE</small> repeated&#x003E; two times. &#x003C;Here is&#x003E; a warning for judges who judge capital cases not to render judgment on the same day as the trial. Rather let them suspend the judgment overnight (rt.: <italic><small>LWN</small></italic>), just as they suspend it overnight (rt.: <italic><small>LWN</small></italic>) in Jerusalem, since it is stated (in Is. 1:21): [<small>SHE</small> (i.e., Jerusalem) <small>WAS FULL OF JUSTICE</small>,] <small>FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS LODGED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>LWN</small></italic>) <small>THERE</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 16:20, cont.:) <small>SO THAT YOU MAY LIVE &#x003C;AND POSSESS THE LAND&#x003E;</small>. Everyone who judges a case with unvarnished truth merits life in the world to come, as stated (in Is. 56:1): <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: OBSERVE JUSTICE, AND PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS; &#x003C;FOR SOON MY SALVATION SHALL COME, AND MY RIGHTEOUSNESS BE REVEALED&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>5.8 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Zech. 13:8): <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS IN IT &#x003C; SHALL BE CUT OFF AND DIE, BUT ONE-THIRD SHALL REMAIN IN IT&#x003E;</small>. This is what is stated through the Holy Spirit at the hands of David (in Ps. 97:7): <small>ALL WHO WORSHIP AN IMAGE, WHO BOAST IN IDOLS, ARE PUT TO SHAME</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">35</xref></sup> With reference to whom were they speaking? They were only speaking with reference to the works of the Holy One. R. Hanina said: The Holy One is going to show his glory to all who have come into the world; for he will lower his throne in the middle of the firmament and again set it in place where the sun rises during the period of &#x003C;the month of&#x003E; Tebeth. R. Hanina the Elder said to him: Is it possible to see his glory, even the one of whom it is written (in Exod. 33:20): <small>FOR NO HUMAN MAY SEE ME AND LIVE</small>? Now you are saying: The Holy One is going to show his glory to all who have come into the world. He said to him: See, it is written (in Ps. 84:12 [11]): <small>FOR THE LORD</small> &#x007B;<small>OF HOSTS</small>&#x007D; [<small>GOD</small>] <small>IS SUN AND SHIELD</small> [&#x2026;.] Just as <small>A SUN AND SHIELD</small> denotes a shield over one in time of war, so also will Holy One be a shield over his children in time of war, at that time &#x003C;of his appearing&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">36</xref></sup> R. Hanina said: In the time that the Lord judges the peoples of the world, he seizes them for judgment, them, their gods, and the one who sets up images<sup><xref rid="fn1337">37</xref></sup> for them. Next he brings the two tablets with the Ten Commandments and says to them (i.e., to the tablets): Have they all paid attention to you? Then they say to him: From the day that you created us, no one has paid attention to us with the lone exception of your people Israel. (Ps. 96:7): <small>WHO BOAST IN IDOLS</small>. &#x003C;It would be&#x003E; more fitting for Scripture to say: <small>WHO TRUST</small>. What is the meaning of <small>WHO BOAST</small>? That they did not perform idol worship until they had honored each other (for doing so). The Holy One said: On each and every day you will feel shame before me. There are those among you who serve doves, and a lot of doves are slaughtered. There are also those among you who serve bricks, and a lot of bricks are broken. There are those among you who serve fish, and a lot of fish are sold in the marketplace. Immediately the Holy One put them to shame, as stated (in Micah 7:16):<small>THE NATIONS SHALL SEE ME AND BE ASHAMED</small>.</p>
<title>5.9 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part IX</title>
<p>R. Hama bar Hanina said: What is the meaning of (Is. 43:9): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER</small>. In the world to come the Holy One brings the book of Torah and puts it on his lap.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">38</xref></sup> Then he says to everyone who has been occupied with Torah: Let him come and receive his reward.<sup><xref rid="fn1339">39</xref></sup> Immediately all the peoples gather in confusion, as stated (ibid.): <small>ALL THE NATIONS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER</small> [&#x2026;.] The Holy One says to them: Do not be gathered in confusion, but &#x003C;have&#x003E; every nation &#x003C;come&#x003E; with its scribe, [as stated] (ibid, cont.): <small>AND LET THE PEOPLES ASSEMBLE</small>. The Roman Empire entered. The Holy One said to them: With what were you occupied? They say: We have established a lot of marketplaces, produced a lot of baths, and multiplied silver and gold. Everything was &#x003C;done&#x003E; so that Israel would &#x003C;have leisure to&#x003E; be occupied with Torah. He said to them: Everything that you did you did for your own needs. Marketplaces are for settling harlots in. Baths are to refresh yourselves. Silver and gold are mine, as stated (in Hag. 2:8): <small>THE SILVER IS MINE, AND THE GOLD IS MINE</small>. The Persian Empire entered. He said to them: With what were you occupied? They say: We have &#x007B;established&#x007D; [conquered] a lot of cities, established a lot of bridges, waged a lot of wars. Everything was &#x003C;done&#x003E; for the sake of Israel. He said to them: Everything that you did you did for the sake of yourselves. Cities were for producing forced labor<sup><xref rid="fn1340">40</xref></sup> in them. Bridges were for collecting tolls. Wars &#x003C;are what&#x003E; I have waged, as stated (in Exod. 15:3): <small>THE LORD IS A MAN OF WAR</small>. Are there any among you declaring this? It is so stated (in Is. 43:9, cont.): <small>WHO AMONG THEM WILL DECLARE THIS</small>? Now <small>THIS</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Deut. 4:44): <small>AND THIS IS THE TORAH WHICH MOSES SET &#x003C;BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. They say to him: Did you give us anything that we have not accepted? [It says about them (in Deut. 33:2): <small>THE LORD CAME FORTH FROM SINAI, AND SHONE UPON THEM FROM SEIR</small>. &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that the Holy One caused &#x003C;the light of Torah&#x003E; to shine over all the peoples of the world, but they did not accept it.] They say to him: Sovereign of the World, give it to us in advance, and we will carry it out. He says to them: I am giving you an easy commandment. If you observe it, I will give [you a reward] like &#x003C;that of&#x003E; Israel. He says to them: Go and build a sukkah. Immediately each and every one goes and builds a sukkah for himself. But when the Holy One brings out the sun from its case,<sup><xref rid="fn1341">41</xref></sup> each one tramples down his sukkah and goes away, as stated (in Ps. 2:3): <small>LET US BREAK THEIR BONDS ASUNDER</small>. Then the Holy One laughs at them, as stated (in vs. 4): <small>THE ONE SITTING IN THE HEAVENS WILL LAUGH; THE LORD WILL DERIDE THEM</small>.</p>
<title>5.10 Deuteronomy 16:18ff, Part X</title>
<p>(Ps. 97:7, end:) &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>ALL GODS BOW DOWN TO</small> &#x007B;<small>YOU</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIM</small>]. When he judges the peoples of the world, he will judge their gods along with them, as stated (in Is. 66:16): <small>FOR IN FIRE WILL THE LORD EXECUTE JUDGMENT&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1342">42</xref></sup> When they are unable to remain in the fire, they fly away. Then the Holy One sends out angels with &#x003C;prisoner&#x003E; collars<sup><xref rid="fn1343">43</xref></sup> and chains, and they cast them into the midst of the daylight, as stated (in Mal. 3:19 [4:1]): <small>AND DAY THAT COMES SHALL SET THEM ABLAZE&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Ps. 97:7): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>ALL GODS BOW DOWN TO</small> &#x007B;<small>YOU</small>&#x007D; [<small>HIM</small>]. The peoples of the world say to their gods: Come and fall down before the Holy One, for you have led us astray. Immediately (according to Is. 2:18): <small>AND THE IDOLS SHALL COMPLETELY VANISH</small>. Then the Holy One brings the peoples of the world down into Gehinnom. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 97:7): <small>ALL WHO WORSHIP AN IMAGE, &#x003C;WHO BOAST IN IDOLS, &#x003E; ARE PUT TO SHAME&#x2026;</small>. (Zech. 13:8:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND, SAYS THE LORD, THAT TWO-THIRDS IN IT SHALL BE CUT OFF</small> &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>DIE, BUT ONE-THIRD</small> (<italic>shelishit</italic>) <small>SHALL REMAIN IN IT</small>. [These comprise Israel, who are from a deposit (<italic>shelishut</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1344">44</xref></sup> for the world &#x003C;as&#x003E; the children of three (<italic>sheloshet</italic>) patriarchs. Another interpretation (of Zech. 13:8:) <small>BUT ONE-THIRD SHALL REMAIN IN IT</small>.: &#x003C;These words mean&#x003E; that they shall only settle in their land in a third deliverance. The first deliverance was the deliverance from Egypt. The second was the deliverance of &#x003C;in the time of&#x003E; Ezra. The third has no interruption. R. Simlay said: Six hundred and thirteen commandments were spoken to Moses on Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn1345">45</xref></sup> David came and reduced them to eleven, as stated (in Ps. 15:1&#x2013;2): <small>O LORD, WHO SHALL DWELL IN YOUR TENT</small>? [&#x2026;. ] <small>THE ONE WHO WALKS BLAMELESSLY&#x2026;</small>. up to (vs. 5): <small>THE ONE WHO DOES THESE THINGS SHALL NEVER BE SHAKEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">46</xref></sup> Isaiah came and reduced them to six, as stated (in Is. 33:15): (1) <small>ONE WHO WALKS RIGHTEOUSLY AND</small> (2) <small>SPEAKS UPRIGHTLY</small>, (3) <small>WHO DETESTS THE UNJUST GAIN OF OPPRESSION</small>, (4) <small>WHO SHAKES HIS FINGER</small> (literally: <small>HIS HAND</small>) <small>AGAINST GRASPING AT A BRIBE</small>, (5) [<small>WHO SHUTS OFF HIS EARS AGAINST HEARING OF BLOODSHED</small>,] <small>AND</small> (6) <small>CLOSES HIS EYES AGAINST LOOKING AT EVIL</small>. It is also written after that (in vs.16): &#x007B;<small>AND</small>&#x007D; <small>THAT SUCH A ONE SHALL DWELL ON THE HEIGHTS; THE STRONGHOLDS ON CLIFFS SHALL BE HIS REFUGE, WITH HIS FOOD SUPPLIED AND HIS WATER ASSURED</small>. Micah came and reduced them to three, as stated (in Micah 6:8): <small>HE HAS TOLD YOU, O HUMAN, WHAT IS GOOD. SO WHAT DOES THE LORD DEMAND OF YOU BUT TO PRACTICE JUSTICE, LOVE KINDNESS, AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH YOUR GOD</small>. Amos came and reduced them to two, as stated (in Amos 5:4): <small>FOR THUS SAYS THE LORD</small> [&#x2026;]: <small>SEEK ME AND LIVE</small>. Habakkuk came and reduced them to one, as stated (in Hab. 2:4): <small>BUT THE RIGHTEOUS PERSON SHALL LIVE BY HIS FAITHFULNESS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">47</xref></sup></p>

<title>6.1 Deuteronomy 21:10ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 21:10:) <small>WHEN YOU GO OUT TO WAR &#x003C;AGAINST YOUR ENEMIES, AND THE LORD YOUR GOD GIVES THEM INTO YOUR HAND&#x003E; AND YOU TAKE THEM CAPTIVE</small>. Our masters have taught (<italic>Avot</italic> 4:2): <small>&#x003C;ONE&#x003E; GOOD DEED BRINGS ABOUT &#x003C;ANOTHER&#x003E; GOOD DEED, AND &#x003C;ONE&#x003E; TRANSGRESSION BRINGS ABOUT &#x003C;ANOTHER&#x003E; TRANSGRESSION</small>. (Deut. 21:11&#x2013;12:) <small>AND WHEN YOU SEE AMONG THE CAPTIVES A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN &#x003C;WHOM YOU DESIRE TO TAKE FOR A WIFE, YOU SHALL BRING HER INTO YOUR HOUSE, &#x003E; WHERE SHE SHALL SHAVE HER HEAD</small>, so that she will not find favor in his eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn1348">1</xref></sup> What is written after that (in vs. 15):) <small>WHEN A MAN HAS TWO WIVES</small>. Two wives in &#x003C;one&#x003E; house &#x003C;means&#x003E; strife in the house. And moreover (ibid., cont.:) <small>ONE LOVED AND THE OTHER HATED</small>, or both of them hated. What is written after that (in vs. 18)? <small>IF ONE HAS A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>. Whenever anyone marries a pretty face, there results from it <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>. Thus we find it so in the case of David, because (as suggested by II Sam. 3:3) he had lusted for Maacah bat Talmai king of Geshur, while he had gone to war.<sup><xref rid="fn1349">2</xref></sup> So Absalom came out of him &#x003C;in this union&#x003E;, who wanted to kill him and (according to II Sam. 16:22) slept with his wives before the eyes of all Israel and in broad daylight. Also because of him several myriads from Israel were killed. So he made discord in Israel. Also killed were Shimei [ben Gera] (in I Kings 2:46), Sheba ben Bichri (in II Sam. 20:22), Ahithophel (in II Sam. 17:23), Mephibosheth,<sup><xref rid="fn1350">3</xref></sup> and Ishbosheth (in II Sam. 4:7). Moreover &#x003C;David&#x003E; had Ziba rule over the whole house of Saul (II Sam. 16:4; cf. II Sam. 9:9). It is also taught: R. Jose says:<sup><xref rid="fn1351">4</xref></sup> Is it because <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small> ate half a pound<sup><xref rid="fn1352">5</xref></sup> of meat and drank half a log of wine that Torah says for one to go out to the place for &#x003C;execution by&#x003E; stoning (cf. Deut. 21:18&#x2013;21)? It is simply that Torah has foreseen the end of <small>A DEFIANT AND REBELLIOUS SON</small>, that he ends up squandering his father&#x2019;s assets with wastrels with whom he eats and drinks, until he seeks what he has been accustomed to and does not find it.<sup><xref rid="fn1353">6</xref></sup> Then he goes out to the crossroads, where he kills people and robs<sup><xref rid="fn1354">7</xref></sup> them. So Torah is saying: Let him die innocent and not die guilty, for the death of the wicked is fitting for them and fitting for the world. And what is written after that (in vs. 22)? <small>AND WHEN SOMEONE IS GUILTY OF A CRIME PUNISHABLE BY DEATH AND IS PUT TO DEATH</small>. If he is delivered from the one,<sup><xref rid="fn1355">8</xref></sup> he is not delivered from the other.

[<small>WHEN YOU BUILD A NEW HOUSE, &#x003C;YOU SHALL MAKE A PARAPET FOR YOUR ROOF&#x003E;</small>.] You have the right to build a house and make a parapet.

<title>6.2 Deuteronomy 22:6ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 22:6&#x2013;7): <small>WHEN YOU COME ACROSS A BIRD NEST</small>, [&#x2026;.] <small>YOU MUST SURELY LET &#x003C;THE MOTHER&#x003E; GO</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 4:23): <small>MORE THAN ANY OBSERVANCE PRESERVE YOUR HEART, FOR OUT OF IT COMES LIFE</small>. R. Abba said:<sup><xref rid="fn1357">10</xref></sup> There are two hundred and forty-eight [positive] commandments in the Torah corresponding to the organs that are in a human being; for each and every organ cries out at the person and says: Perform a commandment with me so that we may live through its merit and you may lengthen your life. There are also three hundred and sixty-five negative commandments like the number of the solar days. So on each day while the sun rises until it sets, it speaks and cries out at a person: You who have lived your life up to this day. Do not commit this transgression against me, and do not tilt me and the whole world toward the scale of guilt. Here are six hundred and thirteen commandments. Moreover, for each and every commandment mentioned there is a reward. For example honoring father and mother (in Exod. 20:12 // Deut. 5:16) and leaving a nest alone (in Deut. 22:7) &#x003C;result in&#x003E; a lengthening of life. There are also commandments with children as the reward, as, for example, Sarah, who lodged travellers (in Gen. 18:6&#x2013;14), and the Shunammite woman, who received Elisha (II Kings. 4:8&#x2013;17). There is also transgression, &#x003C;which may&#x003E; require stoning, burning, slaying (with the sword),<sup><xref rid="fn1358">11</xref></sup> or strangulation.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">12</xref></sup> Of all the commandments, however, none is as easy as leaving a nest alone. And what it its remuneration (according to Deut. 22:7)? <small>IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH YOU AND YOU MAY LENGTHEN YOUR LIFE</small>. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who brought laborers into his field to plant it but did not reveal to them the remuneration for their planting. At evening he gave one gold coin to whoever planted one tree. They all began to be amazed [and say]: Now if the one who has only planted a light and small tree [has received] one gold coin, how much the more will there be for us who have planted many &#x003C;of them&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">13</xref></sup> So if the remuneration for leaving a nest alone [&#x003C;has&#x003E; a lengthening of life as its remuneration], how much the more will be the remuneration for a commandment in which there is material loss, hardship, and &#x003C;the need to&#x003E; preserve one&#x2019;s life. For this reason the Holy One did not explain the remuneration for the commandments which are in the Torah, so that Israel of its own accord would fulfill them and thereby increase the remuneration. Thus we have learned (in <italic>Avot</italic> 1:3): <small>DO NOT BE LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER &#x003C;FOR THE SAKE OF RECEIVING AN AWARD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. [It is therefore written (in Prov. 4:23): <small>MORE THAN ANY OBSERVANCE PRESERVE YOUR HEART, FOR OUT OF IT COMES LIFE</small>.]</p>
<title>6.3 Deuteronomy 22:6ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 22:7): <small>YOU MUST SURELY LET &#x003C;THE MOTHER&#x003E; GO</small>. If you let it<sup><xref rid="fn1361">14</xref></sup> go, (Is. 59:18:) <small>ACCORDING TO THEIR DEEDS, SO SHALL HE REPAY</small>. See what is written (in Jer. 50:33): <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ARE OPPRESSED&#x2026;. THEY REFUSE TO LET THEM GO</small>. It also says (in vs. 34): <small>THEIR REDEEMER IS MIGHTY, &#x003C;HIS NAME IS&#x003E; THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>. It also says (in Is. 16:2): <small>FOR IT SHALL BE THAT THE DAUGHTERS OF MOAB AT THE FORDS OF THE ARNON SHALL BE LIKE A MIGRATING BIRD, AN ABANDONED NEST</small>. This text is related (to Jer. 17:11): <small>AS A PARTRIDGE HATCHES WITHOUT LAYING, SO IS ONE WHO MAKES MONEY APART FROM JUSTICE&#x2026;</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 12): <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE EXALTED FROM THE BEGINNING, OUR SACRED SHRINE</small>. What is the connection between the two &#x003C;verses&#x003E;? Whoever says <small>A PARTRIDGE HATCHES</small> is &#x003C;really&#x003E; saying <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE</small>. &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach you that a partridge brings eggs from other birds and sits on them until &#x003C;the young&#x003E; emerge from their shells and become fledglings. Then they rise up over it and pluck its wings. When it goes out to fly, it is unable &#x003C;to do so&#x003E; because its wings are plucked. So a wild beast or reptile finds it and eats it. And what caused his &#x003C;destruction&#x003E;? &#x003C;It happened&#x003E; because it had raised eggs that were not its own. So it shall be with the peoples of the world, when they stretch their hands against (according to Jer. 17:12) <small>A GLORIOUS THRONE EXALTED FROM THE BEGINNING, OUR SACRED SHRINE</small>. They destroyed it, burned its temple, and carried Israel into exile. But as for Moab and Ammon, the Holy One shall destroy their memory, as stated (in Zeph. 2:9): <small>THEREFORE, AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD OF HOSTS</small>, [<small>THE GOD OF ISRAEL</small>,] <small>SURELY MOAB SHALL BECOME LIKE SODOM, AND THE CHILDREN OF AMMON LIKE GOMORRAH, &#x2026;, AND DESOLATION EVERMORE. A REMNANT OF MY PEOPLE SHALL PLUNDER THEM&#x2026;</small>.</p>

<p>(Deut. 25:17:) <small>REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK</small> (Esau&#x2019;s grandson) <small>DID TO YOU</small>. This verse is related (to Ps. 109:14): <small>MAY THE INIQUITY OF HIS FATHERS BE REMEMBERED BEFORE THE LORD&#x2026;.</small> Were the fathers of Esau wicked?<sup><xref rid="fn1362">15</xref></sup> And were they not righteous? His grandfather was Abraham. His father was Isaac. Yet are you saying (in Ps. 109:14): <small>MAY THE INIQUITY OF HIS FATHERS BE REMEMBERED</small>&#x0021; &#x003C;The verse is&#x003E; simply &#x003C;referring to&#x003E; a sin that he sinned against his fathers.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">16</xref></sup> And how did he sin against his fathers?<sup><xref rid="fn1364">17</xref></sup> You find that Isaac got his vitality from Abraham; yet he lived a hundred and eighty years, while Abraham &#x003C;only&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1365">18</xref></sup> lived a hundred and seventy-five years.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">19</xref></sup> Rabbi Levi said: During the five years that were withheld from Abraham&#x2019;s life, Esau committed two serious transgressions. He violated a betrothed maiden, and he took a life. The one is what is written about (in Gen. 25:29): <small>THEN ESAU CAME FROM THE FIELD, AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED</small>. Now <small>FIELD</small> can only be a reference to a <small>BETROTHED MAIDEN</small> [of whom it is stated (in Deut. 22:25): <small>IF IN THE FIELD THE MAN FINDS A MAIDEN WHO IS BETROTHED, &#x003C;AND THE MAN SEIZES HER AND LIES WITH HER&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small>] Moreover, <small>EXHAUSTED</small> can only be a reference to a murderer, of whom it is stated (in Jer. 4:31): <small>WOE TO ME, NOW</small>&#x0021; <small>FOR MY LIFE IS EXHAUSTED BEFORE THOSE WHO KILL</small>. Rabbi Zakkay [the Elder] said: He also stole, as stated (in Obad. 5): <small>IF THIEVES HAVE COME TO YOU</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1367">20</xref></sup> The Holy One said: I had already promised my beloved Abraham (in Gen. 15:15): <small>YOU SHALL GO UNTO YOUR ANCESTORS IN PEACE; YOU SHALL BE BURIED &#x003C;AT A GOOD OLD AGE&#x003E;</small>. But now he would see his grandson, when he was robbing with violence, practicing seduction, and shedding blood. At that time he was a good grandfather; &#x003C;so&#x003E; it was better for him as a righteous man to be gathered (to his ancestors) in peace, as stated in Ps. 63:4 [3]): <small>FOR STEADFAST LOVE IS BETTER THAN LIFE</small>. And what sin did he commit against his father? He caused his eyes to become dim during his lifetime. Hence they have said: Whoever produces a wicked son or a wicked disciple causes his eyes to grow dim during his lifetime. A wicked son came from Isaac, as written (in (Gen. 27:1): <small>&#x003C;AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD&#x003E; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE</small>. [Why? Because he produced Esau the Wicked.] In regard to a wicked disciple, &#x003C;there was a disciple&#x003E; from Ahijah the Shilonite, as stated (in I Kings 14:4): <small>NOW AHIJAH</small> &#x007B;<small>THE SHILONITE</small>&#x007D; <small>COULD NOT SEE, BECAUSE HIS EYES WERE DIM FROM OLD AGE</small>. Why? Because he produced a wicked disciple in Jeroboam. [(Ps. 109:14:) <small>AND LET NOT THE SIN OF HIS MOTHER BE BLOTTED OUT</small>.] But how had he sinned against his mother? R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and &#x003C;our&#x003E; masters &#x003C;differ&#x003E;. R. Judah says: When he left his mother&#x2019;s belly, he severed her uterus<sup><xref rid="fn1368">21</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., placenta&#x007D;, with the result that she would not bear &#x003C;any more children&#x003E;. This is what is written (in Amos 1:11): <small>BECAUSE HE</small> (i.e., Edom, which is Esau) <small>PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD AND DESTROYED HIS WOMB</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">22</xref></sup> Moreover, R. Berekhyah says: You should not say &#x003C;this&#x003E; in reference to when he had left &#x003C;his mother&#x2019;s uterus&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1370">23</xref></sup> Rather, as he was leaving his mother&#x2019;s uterus, his <italic>zerta</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1371">24</xref></sup> &#x007B;i.e., fist&#x007D; was stretched out against him (i.e., against his brother Jacob). What is the reasoning? (Ps. 58:4 [3]:) <small>THE WICKED GO ASTRAY</small> (<italic>zoru</italic>) <small>FROM THE WOMB</small>. R. Nehemiah says: He was the cause of her not producing twelve tribes, since Rav Huna has said: Rebekah was worthy of producing twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 25:23): <small>AND THE LORD SAID TO HER: TWO NATIONS ARE</small> [<small>IN YOUR WOMB</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1372">25</xref></sup> Here] are two. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND TWO PEOPLES</small>. Here are four. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND ONE PEOPLE SHALL BE STRONGER THAN THE OTHER</small>. Here are six. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND THE ELDER SHALL SERVE THE YOUNGER</small>. Here are eight. (vs. 24:) <small>AND BEHOLD THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB</small>. Here are ten. (vs. 25:) <small>THE FIRST CAME OUT RUDDY</small>. [Here are eleven.] (vs. 26:) <small>AND AFTERWARD HIS BROTHER CAME OUT</small>. Here are twelve. There are also some who apply a passage to her (from vs. 22): <small>AND SHE SAID: IF SO, WHY AM I HERE</small> (<italic><small>ZH</small></italic>)? By gematria<sup><xref rid="fn1373">26</xref></sup> <small>Z</small> (&#x003D;7) &#x002B; <small>H</small> (&#x003D;5) &#x003C;for a total of&#x003E; twelve. But &#x003C;our&#x003E; masters have said: He was the cause of her bier not going forth publicly &#x003C;to her funeral&#x003E;. You find that when Rebekah died, they were saying: Who will go before her? Abraham is dead. Isaac&#x2019;s eyes are dim, and he is sitting at home. Jacob has gone to Paddan-aram. Should Esau the Wicked go before her? Then people would say &#x003C;in Aramaic&#x003E;:<sup><xref rid="fn1374">27</xref></sup> Cursed be her breasts for suckling this man &#x007B;i.e., &#x003C;in Hebrew&#x003E;: cursed be the breasts that have suckled one like this man&#x007D;. What did they do? They brought out her bier at night. R. Jose bar Hanina said: Because they brought out her bier at night, the text only explained about her obliquely. Thus it is written (in Gen. 35:8): <small>THEN REBEKAH&#x2019;S NURSE, DEBORAH, DIED &#x003C;AND WAS BURIED UNDER THE OAK BELOW BETHEL&#x003E;</small> [<small>AND ITS NAME WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK</small> (<italic>Allon-bacuth</italic>)]. What is the meaning of <italic>Allon-bacuth</italic>? Two weepings.<sup><xref rid="fn1375">28</xref></sup> While Jacob was seated in observance of mourning for &#x007B;his&#x007D; [her] nurse, the news about his mother came to him. This is related (to Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>AND BLESSED HIM</small>. With what blessing did he bless him? He blessed him with the blessing &#x003C;of consolation given to&#x003E; mourners.<sup><xref rid="fn1376">29</xref></sup> The Holy One said: Did his father pay him (i.e. Esau) back with evil? Did his mother pay him back with evil? Did his brother pay him back with evil? Did his grand[father] pay him back with evil? Did you pay him back with evil? So should I pay him back with evil? When you mention his name below, I shall blot out his name above. (Ps. 109:15:) <small>LET THEM</small> (the iniquity against his fathers and the sin against his mother) <small>ALWAYS BE BEFORE THE LORD</small>. Whatever he has done, he has done against me. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND MAY HE HAVE THEIR MEMORY CUT OFF FROM THE EARTH</small>.

<p>(Deut. 25:17:) <small>REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK DID TO YOU</small>. R. Tanhum bar Hanila&#x2019;i opened &#x003C;his discourse&#x003E; (with Job 13:12): <small>YOUR REMEMBRANCES</small> (i.e., of Amalek) <small>ARE PROVERBS OF ASHES; YOUR RESPONSES ARE RESPONSES OF CLAY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1377">30</xref></sup> The Holy One said to Israel: These two remembrances are what I have mentioned to you in the Torah: &#x007B;You are to be mindful of them.&#x007D; (Deut. 25:19:) <small>YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>. [(Exod. 17:14:) <small>I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>. You are to be mindful of them.] (Job 13:12:) <small>PROVERBS OF ASHES</small>. If you are worthy, you shall be children of Abraham who compared himself with ashes, where it is written (in Gen. 18:27): <small>FOR I AM DUST AND ASHES</small>. But if &#x003C;you are&#x003E; not &#x003C;worthy&#x003E;, (according to Job 13:12): <small>YOUR RESPONSES ARE RESPONSES OF CLAY</small>. Prepare yourselves for enslavement in Egypt, as written (in Exod. 1:14): <small>AND THEY MADE THEIR LIVES BITTER</small> &#x2026; <sup><xref rid="fn1378">31</xref></sup> <small>WITH HARD LABOR AT CLAY AND BRICKS</small>.</p>

<p>Rabbi Judan opened &#x003C;his discourse&#x003E; in the name of R. Ayyevu (with Ps. 32:9): <small>DO NOT BE LIKE A HORSE OR A MULE, WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1379">32</xref></sup> Six things are stated about the horse:<sup><xref rid="fn1380">33</xref></sup> (1) It eats much and (2) excretes little. (3) It loves promiscuity, (4) loves battle, (5) has a haughty spirit, (6) and abhors sleep. Moreover, there are also some who say: The horse wants to kill its master in battle. (Ibid.:) <small>DO NOT BE LIKE A HORSE OR A MULE &#x003C;WITH A BRIDLE AND A BIT&#x003E;. ITS TRAPPINGS ARE FOR HOLDING IT IN CHECK</small>. In the case of such a horse, when one bridles it, it balks. When one feeds it barley, it balks. When one pacifies it, it balks. When one approaches it, it balks &#x007B;i.e., kicks&#x007D;. You are not to be like that. Rather be careful [to repay] the good person for his goodness and to repay the evil person for his evil. (Deut. 25:17:) <small>REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK DID TO YOU</small>.</p>
<title>6.7 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Rabbi Banna&#x2019;ah opened &#x003C;his discourse&#x003E; (with Prov. 11:1): <small>FRAUDULENT SCALES ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1381">34</xref></sup> If you see a generation whose measures are false, know that the empire will engage that generation in battle.

<title>6.8 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part V</title>
<p>R.

Is it really possible for a generation with false measures to be successful? Actually (ibid., cont.): <small>AND WITH A BAG OF FRAUDULENT WEIGHTS</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1383">36</xref></sup> R.

YOU SHALL NOT HAVE ALTERNATIVE EPHAH MEASURES IN YOUR HOUSE&#x2026;</small>. If you do so, the empire will come and engage you in battle. And what evidence is there? (Deut.: 25:16:) <small>FOR EVERYONE WHO DOES THESE THINGS, WHO ACTS DISHONESTLY, IS AN ABOMINATION TO THE LORD</small> [<small>YOUR GOD</small>].

If someone says to you: Jacob also is &#x003C;included&#x003E; in the total &#x003C;number of people with wicked descendants&#x003E;, say to such a one: &#x201C;You have destroyed wicked ones (in the plural)&#x201D; is not written here, but <small>YOU HAVE DESTROYED THE WICKED ONE</small> (in the singular). [This refers to Esau the Wicked]. <small>YOU HAVE BLOTTED OUT THEIR NAME FOR EVER AND EVER&#x003E;</small>. (Deut. 25:19): <small>YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK&#x2026;</small>.</p>

R. Judan bar Gadya, R. Joshua ben Levi, and the masters differ.<sup><xref rid="fn1385">38</xref></sup> R.

And this agrees with what R. Hanina bar Shilqa, Joshua of Sikhnin, and R. Levi said in the name of R. Johanan. What did the children of the house of Amalek do to Israel?<sup><xref rid="fn1386">39</xref></sup> They cut off their penes and flung them heavenward, as they said: This is what you have chosen for yourself. R. Joshua [ben Levi] said: It should be remembered against them what they did to the Temple, which was the bosom (<italic>heq</italic>) &#x003C;i.e., the center&#x003E; of the earth, as stated (with reference to the Temple in Ezek. 43:14): <small>AND FROM THE LAP</small> (<italic>heq</italic>) <small>OF THE EARTH</small><sup><xref rid="fn1387">40</xref></sup> <small>TO THE &#x003C;LOWER&#x003E; LEDGE: &#x003C;TWO CUBITS&#x003E;</small>. When Samuel came, he repaid them, as stated (in I Sam. 15:33): <small>THEN SAMUEL HEWED AGAG IN PIECES</small>. What did he do to him? R. Abba bar Kahana said: He cut many olive-sized pieces from his flesh and fed them to ostriches. This is what is written (in Job 18:13): <small>&#x003C;IT SHALL CONSUME PIECES OF HIS FLESH; &#x003E; THE FIRSTBORN OF DEATH SHALL CONSUME HIS PIECES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1388">41</xref></sup> in that &#x003C;Samuel&#x003E; chose a cruel (<italic>mar</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1389">42</xref></sup> death for him.

Thus do they put princes (<italic><small>SR</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1392">45</xref></sup> to death with bitter deaths. R. Samuel bar Avdimi said: He judged him by the justice of the peoples of the world (instead of by Torah) without witnesses and without a warning. R.

R. Levi said: The Torah also gave a hint to Israel (about Agag&#x2019;s castration), since it is stated (in Deut. 25:11): <small>WHEN TWO MEN GET INTO A FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER, &#x003C;AND THE WIFE OF ONE DRAWS NEAR TO SAVE HER HUSBAND FROM THE HAND OF THE ONE SMITING HIM,&#x003E; IF SHE PUTS OUT WITH HER HAND AND GRABS &#x003C;THE OTHER MAN&#x003E; BY HIS GENITALS, YOU SHALL CUT OFF HER HAND&#x2026;</small>.

<p>(Deut. 25:17:) <small>AMALEK</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>MLQ</small></italic>): People (&#x2018;<small><italic>M</italic></small>) of the locust (<italic><small>YLQ</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1394">47</xref></sup> They spread out like the <italic>zahla</italic> locust. Another interpretation of <small>AMALEK</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>MLQ</small></italic>): People (&#x2018;<italic>am</italic>) lapping (<italic>leq</italic>), a people who came to lap up the blood of Israel like a dog.<sup><xref rid="fn1395">48</xref></sup> R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon ben Halafta: To what may Amalek be likened? To a fly who is inflamed &#x003C;with passion&#x003E; after an &#x003C;open&#x003E; wound. So was Amalek inflamed like a dog &#x003C;with passion&#x003E; after Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">49</xref></sup> It is taught (in a baraita) in the name of R. Nathan: Amalek came four hundred parasangs (i.e., a little over 900 English miles) to fight with Israel in Rephidim, as stated (in Numb. 13:29):<sup><xref rid="fn1397">50</xref></sup> <small>AMALEK DWELLS IN THE LAND OF THE NEGEB&#x2026;</small>. And he [dwells] in the interior beyond all of them (i.e., beyond all the tribes listed in this passage).<sup><xref rid="fn1398">51</xref></sup> (Deut. 25:17:) <small>&#x003C;REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK DID TO YOU&#x003E; ON THE WAY AS YOU CAME OUT OF EGYPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1399">52</xref></sup> R. Levi said: He came upon them from the wayside like a bandit.<sup><xref rid="fn1400">53</xref></sup> It is comparable to a king who had a vineyard which he had enclosed with a fence and in which he had put a biting dog. The king said: Whenever anyone comes to break through the fence, the dog will bite him. One day the king&#x2019;s son came and broke through the fence. The dog bit him. Whenever he wanted to bring to mind the transgression of his son who broke through to the vineyard, he would say to him: You remember how the dog bit you. Similarly, whenever the Holy One wants to bring to mind the sin of Israel, what they did in Rephidim, when they said (in Exod. 17:7) <small>IS THE LORD PRESENT AMONG US OR NOT</small>? He says to them (in Deut. 25:17): <small>REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK DID TO YOU</small>.</p>
<title>6.13 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 25:18:) <small>HOW HE ENCOUNTERED YOU ON THE WAY</small>. R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and and the masters &#x003C;differ&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1401">54</xref></sup> R. Judah says: <small>HOW HE ENCOUNTERED</small> (<italic><small>QR</small></italic>, rt.: <italic><small>QRH</small></italic>) <small>YOU</small>, &#x003C;i.e.,&#x003E; defiled you. &#x003C;It is&#x003E; just as you say (in Deut. 23:11 [10]): <small>&#x003C;WHO IS UNCLEAN BECAUSE OF&#x003E; WHAT HE ENCOUNTERS</small> (rt.: <italic><small>QRH</small></italic>) <small>AT NIGHT</small> (i.e., a nocturnal emission). R. Nehemiah said: He read (<italic><small>QR</small></italic>&#x2019;) data concerning you. What did Amalek do? He went down to the Egyptian hall of records<sup><xref rid="fn1402">55</xref></sup> and obtained the records<sup><xref rid="fn1403">56</xref></sup> on the tribes, where their names were inscribed against them for the number of bricks. Then he would stand outside &#x003C;Israel&#x2019;s protective&#x003E; cloud and cry out (rt.: <italic><small>QRH</small></italic>) to them: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, come out, for I am your brother; and we want to transact business<sup><xref rid="fn1404">57</xref></sup> with you. When they came out, he killed them. And the masters say: He cooled (<italic><small>QR</small></italic>) you, i.e., he made Israel &#x003C;appear&#x003E; lukewarm (rt.: <italic><small>QRR</small></italic>) before others. R. &#x007B;Huna&#x007D; [Hanina] said: A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a boiling bath<sup><xref rid="fn1405">58</xref></sup> into which no creature is able to descend. A certain child of Belial came and leaped down into it. Even though he was scalded, he made it cool to others. So also when Israel came out of Egypt, and when the sea was divided before them, while the Egyptians were drowned in its midst, fear of them fell upon all the peoples, as stated (in Exod. 15:15&#x2013;16): <small>THEN WERE THE CHIEFS OF EDOM DISMAYED&#x2026;. TERROR AND FRIGHT FELL UPON THEM</small>. When Amalek came and joined in battle with them, even though he received his &#x003C;scalding&#x003E; at their hands, he made &#x003C;Israel appear&#x003E; lukewarm (in battle) before the peoples of the world.</p>
<title>6.14 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 25:18, cont.:) <small>AND HE CUT OFF</small> (rt.: <italic><small>ZNB</small></italic>) <small>ALL WHO WERE LAGGING BEHIND YOU</small>. He smote them with a blow to the tail (rt.: <italic><small>ZNB</small></italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1406">59</xref></sup> for that is what R.

Judah said: They said: If he is master over all that happens, as he is ruler over us, we will serve him; but if not, we will not serve him. R. Nehemiah said: They said: If he furnishes us with our food like a king who is living in the province so that the province lacks nothing at all, we will serve him; but if not, we will revolt against him. And the Rabbis said: They said: If we have a thought in our hearts and he knows what we are thinking, we will serve him; but if not, we will revolt against him. R. Berekhyah said [in the name of R. Levi]: In their heart they had a thought, and the Holy One granted them their request. And what is the evidence? (Ps. 78:18:) <small>THEY TESTED GOD IN THEIR HEART &#x003C;BY ASKING FOOD FOR THEMSELVES&#x003E;</small>.

<title>6.16 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part VI</title>
<p>(Deut. 25:18, cont.:) <small>WHEN YOU WERE TIRED AND WEARY, AND HE DID NOT FEAR GOD</small>. &#x003C;You were&#x003E; TIRED from thirst <small>AND WEARY</small> from the road, <small>AND HE DID NOT FEAR GOD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1415">68</xref></sup> R. Pinhas said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahmani: It is a transmitted <italic>aggada</italic> &#x003C;that&#x003E; Esau (i.e., Rome) will fall at the hand of the children of Rachel (Joseph and Benjamin), as stated (in Jer. 49:20): <small>SURELY THE YOUNGEST OF THE FLOCK SHALL DRAG THEM AWAY</small>. Why does it call them <small>THE YOUNGEST OF THE FLOCK</small>? Because they were the youngest of the tribes, for <small>YOUTH</small> is written with reference to the one and <small>LEAST</small> is written with reference to the other (i.e., with reference to Esau). <small>YOUTH</small> is written with reference to the one (in Gen. 37:2): <small>SINCE HE</small> (Joseph) <small>WAS A YOUTH WITH THE CHILDREN OF BILHAH &#x003C;AND WITH THE CHILDREN OF ZILPAH&#x003E;</small>. And <small>LEAST</small> is written with reference to the other (in Obad., vs. 2): <small>I WILL SURELY MAKE YOU</small> (Edom, i.e., Rome) <small>LEAST AMONG THE NATIONS</small>. The one (Esau) grew up with two who were righteous (i.e., with Isaac and Rebekah) and did not learn from their deeds, while the other grew up with two who were wicked (i.e., Potiphar and Pharaoh) and did not learn from their deeds. Therefore, the former will come and fall by the hand of the latter. The former, of whom it is written (in Deut. 25:18): <small>AND HE DID NOT FEAR GOD</small>, will come and fall by the hand of the latter, of whom it is written (in Gen. 42:18): <small>I FEAR GOD</small>.</p>
<title>6.17 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part VII</title>
<p>(Deut. 25:19:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS WHEN THE LORD YOUR GOD GRANTS YOU REST &#x2026;, YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>. R. Azariah said R. Judah bar Simon said in the name of R. Judah bar Il&#x2019;ay: Israel was given three commandments on their entrance to the land:<sup><xref rid="fn1416">69</xref></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>To appoint a king over themselves, as written (in Deut. 17:15): <small>YOU SHALL SURELY PLACE A KING OVER YOURSELF</small>.</li>
<li>To build the Temple, as written (in Exod. 25:8): <small>AND MAKE ME A SANCTUARY</small>.</li>
<li>To blot out the remembrance of Amalek, as stated (in Deut. 25:19): <small>YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>R. Joshua ben Levi &#x003C;said&#x003E; in the name of Rabbi Alexandri: One text says (in Deut. 25:19): <small>YOU SHALL BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>, while another another text says (in Exod. 17:14): <small>I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF AMALEK</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">70</xref></sup> How are these two texts to be harmonized? Before &#x003C;the Amalekites&#x003E; raised their hands against the &#x003C;heavenly&#x003E; throne, <small>YOU SHALL BLOT OUT</small>. When they had raised their hands against the &#x003C;heavenly&#x003E; throne, <small>I WILL &#x2026; BLOT OUT</small>. Can flesh and blood possibly raise one&#x2019;s hand against the throne of the Holy One? It is simply &#x003C;a reference&#x003E; to the hands of those who destroyed Jerusalem, since it is written (in Jer. 3:17): F<small>OR AT THAT TIME THEY SHALL CALL JERUSALEM THE THRONE OF THE LORD</small>. It is therefore written (in Exod. 17:14): <small>I WILL UTTERLY BLOT OUT</small>.</p>
<title>6.18 Deuteronomy 25:17ff, Part VIII</title>
<p>(Exod. 17:15&#x2013;16:) <small>&#x003C;AND MOSES BUILT AN ALTER AND CALLED ITS NAME <italic>ADONAI-NISSI</italic>.&#x003E; AND HE SAID: &#x003C;IT IS&#x003E; BECAUSE A HAND IS UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD. THE LORD HAS A WAR WITH AMALEK FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION</small>. It is taught in the name of R. Eleazar: The Holy One swore an oath and said: By my right hand, &#x003C;by&#x003E; my right hand, &#x003C;by&#x003E; my throne, &#x003C;by&#x003E; my throne, &#x003C;I swear that&#x003E; if gentiles come from any of the peoples, them I will accept; but those from the seed of Amalek I will not accept.<sup><xref rid="fn1418">71</xref></sup> And David also acted in this way, as stated (in II Sam. 1:13): <small>AND DAVID SAID UNTO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD TOLD HIM: WHERE DO YOU COME FROM</small>? <small>THEN HE SAID I AM THE SON OF AN AMALEKITE PROSELYTE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1419">72</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: He was the son of Doeg the Edomite. Then David said to him (in vs. 16): <small>YOUR BLOOD BE UPON YOUR OWN HEAD</small>. &#x003C;This is what one reads, but&#x003E; [the written text (<italic>ketiv</italic>) is <small>YOUR BLOODS</small>.] You shed a lot of bloods in Nob, the city of priests.</p>
<p>(Exod. 17:16:) <small>FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION</small>. David said: The Holy One said: <small>FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION</small>, and I am &#x003C;keeping&#x003E; after them (i.e., after the Amalekites) for generations of generations. R. Eliezer, R. Joshua, and R. Jose differ: R. Eliezer says: From the generation of Moses to the generation of Samuel. R. Joshua says: From the generation of Samuel to the generation of Mordecai and Esther. And R. Jose says: From the generation of Mordecai and Esther to the generation of the Messianic King, which itself equals three generations. And where is it shown that the generation of the Messianic King equals three generations?<sup><xref rid="fn1420">73</xref></sup> Where it is stated (of the Messianic King in Ps. 72:5): <small>LET THEM FEAR YOU AS LONG AS THE SUN ENDURES AND AS LONG AS THE MOON, A GENERATION AND GENERATIONS</small>. &#x003C;The singular&#x003E; <small>GENERATION</small> equals one, &#x003C;and the plural&#x003E; GENERATIONS equals two, for a total of three. R. Berekhyah [said] in the name or R. Abba bar Kahana: As long as the seed of Amalek remains alive in the world, it is, as it were, as though a wing is hiding the &#x003C;divine&#x003E; face.<sup><xref rid="fn1421">74</xref></sup> When the seed of Amalek has passed from the world, the wing is removed, as stated (in Is. 30:20): <small>YOUR TEACHER</small> (i.e., the Holy One) <small>WILL NO LONGER HIDE HIMSELF</small>.</p>
<p>[(Exod. 17:16:) <small>BECAUSE A HAND IS UPON THE THRONE OF THE LORD</small>.] R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: As long as the seed of Amalek is in the world, the &#x003C;divine&#x003E; Name will not be at peace (literally: whole) and the &#x003C;divine&#x003E; throne will not be at peace. When the seed of Amalek passes from the world, the throne will be at peace, and the Name will be at peace. What is the evidence? That which is stated (in Ps. 9:7[6]): <small>THE ENEMY IS NO MORE, IN EVERLASTING RUINS, AND YOU HAVE UPROOTED &#x003C;THEIR&#x003E; CITIES. THEIR VERY MEMORY HAS PERISHED</small>. What is written after that (in vs. 8[7]): <small>BUT THE LORD SITS &#x003C;ENTHRONED&#x003E; FOREVER; HE HAS ESTABLISHED HIS THRONE FOR JUDGMENT</small>.

<title>7.1 Deuteronomy 26:1ff., 16ff., Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 26:1:) <small>AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS THAT WHEN YOU COME INTO THE LAND</small>, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; (vs. 16:) <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">1</xref></sup> This text is related (to Ps. 95:6): <small>COME, LET US BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP, LET US KNEEL &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD OUR MAKER&#x003E;</small>&#x0021; Now what does the instruction mean by <small>LET US BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1423">2</xref></sup> Moses simply foresaw that the Temple was going to be destroyed and that the firstfruits were going to cease. He arose and arranged for Israel to pray three times on every day, because prayer is more pleasing to the Holy One than a hundred good works. When it was decreed for him not to enter the land, he began to pray, and he said (in Deut. 3:25): <small>PLEASE LET ME CROSS OVER AND SEE &#x003C;THE GOOD LAND&#x003E;</small>. The Holy One said to him (in vss. 26&#x2013;27:): <small>ENOUGH FROM YOU</small>&#x0021; <small>DO NOT EVER SPEAK UNTO ME ON THIS MATTER AGAIN. GO UP TO THE TOP OF PISGAH</small>. It is therefore stated (in 26:16): <small>&#x003C;THIS DAY&#x003E; THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1424">3</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.2 Deuteronomy 26:1ff., 16ff., Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 26:16:) <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM&#x2026;</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1425">4</xref></sup> What is written above about the matter (in vs. 15)? <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, &#x003C;FROM THE HEAVENS AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. R. Abbahu said in the name of R. Jose bar Hanina: How much gratification are they given&#x0021; For those who perform the commandments have a pretext &#x003C;for doing so&#x003E;. If someone has business with the Empire, there are times when he gives some money, until they have him reach the king. When he does reach the king, he has doubts whether he will fulfill his request or not. The Holy One, however, is not like that. Rather when one goes down into his field &#x003C;and&#x003E; sees a &#x003C;grape&#x003E; cluster that has ripened early, a fig tree that has ripened early, a pomegranate that has ripened early, he puts it in a basket, stands in the middle of the field and asks mercy for himself, for Israel, and for the land of Israel. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 26:15): <small>LOOK DOWN FROM YOUR HOLY DWELLING, &#x003C;FROM THE HEAVENS AND BLESS YOUR PEOPLE&#x003E;</small>. And not only that, but when he said: I am not moving from here until you perform my requirements this day, as written next (in vs. 16): <small>THIS DAY THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM&#x2026;</small>. Resh Laqish said: A heavenly voice (<italic>bat qol</italic>) comes forth and says: You shall do it again on this day in the coming year. &#x003C;He is&#x003E; like one who gives fresh fruit to his friend. Then he says: Would that you would do this again, and give me some next year.</p>
<title>7.3 Deuteronomy 26:1ff., 16ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 26:16:) <small>THIS DAY &#x003C;THE LORD YOUR GOD IS COMMANDING YOU TO PERFORM&#x2026;</small>. &#x003E; What is the meaning of <small>THIS DAY</small>? Had the Holy One not given a command to Israel until now? And was not this the fortieth year (since Sinai), as stated (in Deut. 1:3): <small>AND IT CAME TO PASS IN THE FORTIETH YEAR&#x2026;.</small> Then what is the meaning of the words: THIS DAY? Simply that Moses spoke to Israel as follows: On each and every day let the Torah be dear to you, as if you had received it <small>THIS DAY</small> from Mount Sinai. Moreover, it is written in another place (i.e., in Deut. 4:9): <small>&#x003C;LEST YOU FORGET THE THINGS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN &#x2026;,&#x003E; MAKE THEM KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDERN&#x2026;</small>. Then it is written (in vs. 10): <small>AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT &#x003C;HOREB&#x003E;</small>. (Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>THESE STATUTES</small>: These are the midrashic commentaries, <small>AND THESE ORDINANCES</small>: These are the court decisions.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 26:16): <small>THESE STATUTES AND THESE ORDINANCES</small>. &#x003C;They are meant&#x003E; to include light and heavy &#x003C;commandments&#x003E;, inferences from analogy, and fine points of scribal exegesis.</p>
<p>(Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>SO YOU ARE TO BE DILIGENT IN PERFORMING THEM</small>. R. Johanan said: When anyone performs Torah for its own sake, they ascribe it to him as if he had performed it himself &#x003C;at Sinai&#x003E;.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">5</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:14): <small>AND THE LORD COMMANDED ME AT THAT TIME</small> (i.e., not in the future) <small>TO TEACH YOU</small> [<small>THE STATUTES AND THE ORDINANCES FOR YOU TO PERFORM THEM</small>.] &#x201C;To perform&#x201D; is not stated, but: <small>FOR YOU TO PERFORM THEM</small>. Hence they ascribe it to him as if he had performed it himself &#x003C;at Sinai&#x003E;.</p>
<p>[(Deut. 26:16, cont.:) <small>WITH ALL YOUR HEART</small>.] When you pray to the Holy One, you shall not have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One and one for something else.<sup><xref rid="fn1427">6</xref></sup></p>
<title>7.4 Deuteronomy 26:1ff., 16ff., Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 27:9:) <small>THEN MOSES AND THE LEVITICAL PRIESTS SPOKE TO ALL ISRAEL, SAYING: PAY ATTENTION AND LISTEN, O ISRAEL</small>&#x0021; What is the meaning of <small>PAY ATTENTION</small>? Moses said to Israel: Form &#x003C;yourselves into&#x003E; individual classes for &#x003C;the study of&#x003E; Torah, and incline your heart to hear the words of Torah. Another interpretation of <small>PAY ATTENTION</small>: He said to them: Set your heart and soul to hear the words of Torah.</p>
<p>(Deut. 26:16:) <small>WITH ALL YOUR HEART</small>. R. Eliezer ben Jacob says: The text has come to warn Israel with regard to something else.<sup><xref rid="fn1428">7</xref></sup> (Ibid., cont.:) <small>AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL</small> (<italic>nafsheka</italic>), even though &#x003C;someone&#x003E; takes your life (<italic>nafsheka</italic>). On one occasion &#x003C;the Romans&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1429">8</xref></sup> decreed a religious persecution &#x003C;against Israel&#x003E;, in which they were not to occupy themselves with the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1430">9</xref></sup> R. Aqiva proceeded to sit down and occupy himself with the Torah. When Pappus ben Judah found him, he said to him: See here, Rabbi, you are endangering yourself, when you transgress against a decree of the King. R. Aqiva said to him: Let me illustrate for you in a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a fox. As he was walking near a river, he saw &#x003C;some&#x003E; fish there.<sup><xref rid="fn1431">10</xref></sup> He said to them: Get yourselves to me, and I will hide you in the clefts of the rocks. Then you shall not be afraid. They said to him: Are you the most clever of the animals? You are only a fool. All our lives have been &#x003C;spent&#x003E; only in the water. So would you tell us to walk onto the dry land&#x0021; Similarly all the life of Israel exists only in the Torah, of which it is written (in Deut. 30:20): <small>FOR THAT IS YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LENGTH OF DAYS</small>; yet you are saying: You are endangering yourself. In a few days they arrested the both of them. He said to him: It would have been better for you to be arrested for the words of Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">11</xref></sup> Woe to that Pappus, who was arrested for vain words. Subsequently when they brought out R. Aqiva for execution, it was time to recite the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018;. While they combed his flesh,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">12</xref></sup> he was calling out the recitation of the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2018;. About them David has said (in Ps. 17:14): <small>OF THOSE WHO DIE BY YOUR HAND, O LORD &#x003C; &#x2026; THEIR PORTION IS LIFE</small>.&#x003E;<sup><xref rid="fn1434">13</xref></sup> R. Hanina bar Pappa said: Do not read: <small>OF THOSE WHO DIE</small>, but: &#x201C;Those who kill,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1435">14</xref></sup> because they kill themselves for the sake of the Torah, which was given &#x003C;by your hand&#x003E;. Therefore, when the children of Adam see them, they say to each other: They have sins on their hand; that is the reason they were killed. But they do not know that their portion is among the living in the world to come and that everything good is being kept in store for them. It is so stated (Ibid. cont.): <small>MAY YOU FILL THEIR BELLY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE KEPT IN STORE FOR THEM</small>. And not only that, but they attain merit for their children after them. Moreover, because &#x003C;the children of&#x003E; Israel lay down their lives for the Torah and for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, for that reason the Holy One provides them with a blessing in the world, as stated (in Deut. 26:17): <small>TODAY YOU HAVE HAD THE LORD PROMISE</small>. Just as Israel declares [its love] for the Holy One, so does the Holy One declare [his love] for them, as stated (in vs. 18): <small>THE LORD HAS PROCLAIMED YOU TODAY &#x003C;TO BE FOR HIM A TREASURED PEOPLE&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> R. Joshua ben Levi said: Just as the &#x003C;collapsing&#x003E; upper story crushes, so is Israel going to crush four empires. It is so stated (in Deut. 16:19): <small>AND TO SET YOU ON HIGH OVER ALL THE NATIONS THAT HE HAS MADE IN PRAISE, IN NAME, AND IN HONOR</small>.</p>
<p>The End of Parashah <bold><italic>Ki-Tavo</italic></bold></p>
<ftnote id="fn1422">1. In the midrash the parashah actually begins with vs. 16, but the additional verse at the beginning adapts the parashah to the traditional yearly cycle of readings. Note also that verse 16 is translated to fit the context of the midrash.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1424">3. I.e., to obey the command to go up to the top of Pisgah. Although the midrash understands the performance in reference to this one command, the biblical text is speaking about performing statutes and ordinances.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1425">4. According to vs. 12, what the Holy One is commanding concerns the payment of tithes <small>FOR THE LEVITE, THE SOJOURNER, THE ORPHAN, AND THE WIDOW</small>.</ftnote>

<title>Chapter 8 Deuteronomy, Parashah VIII: <italic>Nitstsavim</italic></title>
<title>8.1 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part I)</title>
<p>(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY, ALL OF YOU &#x003C;BEFORE THE LORD&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 12:7): <small>THE WICKED ARE OVERTURNED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>HPK</small></italic>) <small>AND ARE NO MORE, BUT THE HOUSE OF THE RIGHTEOUS SHALL STAND</small>. &#x007B;&#x2026;.&#x007D; Every time that the Holy One looks at the works of the wicked and turns (rt.: <italic><small>HPK</small></italic>) against them, there is no recovery for them.<sup><xref rid="fn1436">1</xref></sup> He overturned the works of the generation of the flood, and there was no recovery for them. What is written concerning them (in Gen. 7:23)? <small>AND HE WIPED OUT ALL LIVING THINGS</small>. He overturned the works of the Sodomites, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25): <small>AND HE OVERTURNED THOSE CITIES</small>. He overturned the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28): <small>AND NOT SO MUCH AS ONE OF THEM REMAINED</small>. He overturned the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22): <small>AND FROM BABYLON I WILL CUT OFF NAME, REMNANT, OFFSPRING, AND POSTERITY&#x2026;</small>. Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13 [12]): <small>THERE THE EVILDOERS HAVE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN AND CANNOT RISE</small>. When Israel falls, however, it stands up &#x003C;again&#x003E;, as stated (in Micah 7:8): <small>REJOICE NOT OVER ME, O MY ENEMY; WHEN I FALL, I SHALL ARISE&#x2026;</small>. It also says (in Mal. 3:6): <small>FOR I THE LORD DO NOT CHANGE; AND YOU, O CHILDREN OF JACOB, ARE NOT DESTROYED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>). R. Hanina bar Pappa said: The Holy One said: I have never smitten a people and restored them, but you children of Jacob are not destroyed, as stated (in Deut. 32:23): <small>I WILL USE UP</small> (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>) <small>MY ARROWS ON THEM</small>. My arrows are used up (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>) but they are not destroyed (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>). And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12): <small>HE HAS BENT HIS BOW; HE HAS SET ME AS A TARGET FOR THE ARROW</small>. To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the &#x003C;target&#x003E; post and shoots the arrows at them (<italic>sic</italic>). The arrows are used up (rt.: <italic><small>KLH</small></italic>), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7): <small>THE WICKED ARE OVERTURNED AND ARE NO MORE</small>. [&#x2026;.]</p>
<title>8.2 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part II</title>
<p>[(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY</small>.] Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said: Why is this parashah next to the parashah on curses (i.e., Deut. 27:11&#x2013;28:69 [29:1]).<sup><xref rid="fn1437">2</xref></sup> Because Israel heard a hundred curses less two in this parashah, apart from the forty-nine which are uttered in the Priestly Torah (i.e., in Leviticus). They immediately turned green in the face and said: Who can withstand these &#x003C;curses&#x003E;? Moses called them immediately (in Deut. 29:1 [2]) and pacified them with words (i.e., with Deut. 29:9 [10].)</p>

<p>What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 29:1&#x2013;2, 6 [2&#x2013;3, 7])? <small>THEN MOSES SUMMONED ALL THE</small> &#x007B;<small>ELDERS OF</small>&#x007D; <small>ISRAEL</small> [<small>AND SAID UNTO THEM</small>]: <small>YOU HAVE SEEN &#x003C;ALL THAT THE LORD DID BEFORE YOUR EYES IN THE LAND OF EGYPT, &#x003E; &#x2026;, THE GREAT TRIALS &#x003C;WHICH YOUR EYES SAW, THE SIGNS, AND THOSE GREAT WONDERS&#x003E;&#x2026;. WHEN YOU CAME UNTO THIS PLACE, &#x003C;SIHON KING OF HESHBON AND OG KING OF BASHAN CAME OUT TO ENGAGE US IN BATTLE; BUT WE DEFEATED THEM&#x003E;</small>. Now in your case, for what reason were you not destroyed? After all, you did not heed my voice, and you uttered words before me for which you deserved destruction. Still I did not wreak destruction upon you, when it is stated (in Ps. 106:7): <small>WHEN OUR ANCESTORS WERE IN EGYPT, THEY DID NOT CONSIDER YOUR WONDROUS WORKS&#x2026;.</small> And not only that but they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. Now if you should say: For what reason are the nations of the world deserving destruction, while we are remaining alive? It is because, when afflictions come upon them, they kick against them and do not recognize the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 79:6): <small>POUR OUT YOUR WRATH UPON THE NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT KNOWN YOU</small>,&#x2026;. In the case of Israel, however, when afflictions come upon them, they submit, as stated (in Ps. 116:3&#x2013;4): <small>I FOUND TROUBLE AND SORROW, BUT I SHALL INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>. Therefore the Holy One said: even though maledictions were coming upon you, they themselves were raising you up; and so it says (in Deut. 8:16): &#x003C;They were coming upon you&#x003E; <small>IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOU AND IN ORDER TO TEST YOU, SO AS TO BENEFIT YOU IN THE END</small>. Thus did Moses say to Israel: Even though afflictions come upon you, you have a standing.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">3</xref></sup> It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU</small> &#x007B;it is therefore stated: <small>YOU</small>&#x007D; <small>ARE STANDING</small>.</p>
<title>8.4 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>YOU ARE STANDING TODAY &#x003C;ALL OF YOU&#x003E;</small>. Just as <small>TODAY</small> (literally: <small>THE DAY</small>) sometimes darkens and sometimes lightens, so it is with you. Although you have darkness, the Holy One is going to shine on you with light eternal, as stated (in Is. 60:19): <small>FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT</small>. When? When you all become one group, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): [<small>BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>] <small>ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY</small>. According to universal custom, if one takes a group of reeds, will he be able to break them at one stroke&#x0021; But if he takes them one by one, even an infant can break them. So also you find that Israel was not redeemed until they became one group, as stated (in Jer. 50:4): <small>IN THOSE DAYS AND AT THAT TIME, SAYS THE LORD, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THEY AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH, SHALL COME TOGETHER</small>. It also says (In Jer. 3:18): [<small>IN THOSE DAYS</small>] <small>THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL GO WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, AND THEY SHALL COME TOGETHER FROM THE LAND OF THE NORTH</small>. When they are united, they shall welcome the face of the Divine Presence.</p>
<title>8.5 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part V</title>
<p>(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) <small>&#x003C;YOU ARE STANDING TODAY, ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE LORD:&#x003E; YOUR TRIBAL LEADERS, &#x003C;YOUR ELDERS, AND YOUR LAW OFFICERS&#x003E;</small>. Although I have appointed for you heads, judges, elders, and law officers, you shall all be equal before me, since it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1439">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): All of you are responsible for each other. Even though there is &#x003C;only&#x003E; one righteous person among you, you all shall survive (literally: stand) through his merit; and not only you, but the whole world in toto, as stated (in Prov. 10:25): <small>BUT A RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE WORLD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1440">5</xref></sup> However, when one sins, the whole generation is stricken, and so you find in the case of Achan (in Josh. 22:20): <small>WAS IT NOT ACHAN BEN ZERAH WHO COMMITTED</small> [<small>EMBEZZLEMENT</small>] <small>IN THE PROSCRIPTION</small> (i.e., the <italic>herem</italic> of Jericho)? <small>YET &#x003C;DIVINE&#x003E; WRATH CAME UPON THE WHOLE</small> [<small>CONGREGATION OF</small>] <small>ISRAEL, SINCE HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO DIE FOR HIS SIN</small>. If when the measure of punishment was small, the &#x003C;whole&#x003E; generation was seized, how much the more &#x003C;will the generation prosper&#x003E;, when the measure of &#x003C;divine&#x003E; favor is great. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL</small>; and not only the great ones who are among us, but (according to vs. 10 [11]) <small>YOUR LITTLE ONES, YOUR WIVES, AND THE ALIEN</small>. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): <small>EVERY PERSON</small>. Now flesh and blood shows more mercy over males than over females, but the Holy One is not like that. Rather (according to Ps. 145:9), <small>&#x003C;THE LORD IS GOOD TO ALL&#x003E; AND HIS MERCY IS UPON ALL HIS WORKS</small>, upon males and upon females, upon the righteous and upon the wicked, as stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10], cont.): <small>FROM THE ONE WHO CHOPS YOUR WOOD TO THE ONE WHO DRAWS YOUR WATER</small>. R. Isaac ben Tavlay said: &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that, when the Gibeonites came to [Moses he did not accept them; but when they came to] Joshua, he did accept them.<sup><xref rid="fn1441">6</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in Josh. 9:4): <small>AND THEY ALSO ACTED WITH CUNNING</small>. What is the meaning of <small>THEY ALSO</small>? &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that they had come to Moses, and he had not accepted them.</p>
<title>8.6 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part VI</title>
<p>(Deut. 29:11 [12]:) <small>TO ENTER INTO THE COVENANT WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD, EVEN THROUGH HIS OATH</small>. Three covenants did the Holy One make with Israel: one when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, &#x007B;one at Horeb,&#x007D; and one here.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">7</xref></sup> But why did he make &#x003C;a covenant&#x003E; with them here? Because they had &#x007B;cooked&#x007D; [revoked] the one which he had made with them &#x003C;on Sinai&#x003E;,<sup><xref rid="fn1443">8</xref></sup> when they said (of the Golden Calf in Exod. 32:4): <small>THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL</small>. For that reason he made &#x003C; another covenant&#x003E; with them on Horeb<sup><xref rid="fn1444">9</xref></sup> and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, <small>ENTER</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>), &#x003C;can&#x003E; only be in the sense of one who says to his companion: May this curse come (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) upon me, if I go back on this word. And so you find that, when they provoked the Holy One, they went into captivity. What did Daniel say (in Dan. 7:11)? <small>AND ALL ISRAEL HAS TRANSGRESSED</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>BR</small></italic>) <small>YOUR TORAH</small> [&#x2026;.] <small>SO THE CURSE</small> (<italic>alah</italic>) <small>AND THE OATH ARE POURED DOWN UPON US</small>. Now <italic>alah</italic> can only be a curse,<sup><xref rid="fn1445">10</xref></sup> as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27): <small>AND THE WOMAN SHALL BECOME A CURSE</small> (<italic>alah</italic>). &#x003C;This is&#x003E; to teach you that, just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say: Why all this bother? It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never change anything for you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12 [13]): <small>IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE</small> [&#x2026;,] <small>&#x003C;AS HE SWORE TO YOUR ANCESTORS, TO ABRAHAM, TO ISAAC, AND TO JACOB&#x003E;</small>. It also says (in Cant. 7:6 [5]): <small>THE KING IS BOUND BY THE TRESSES</small>. Now no one is bound except by an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4 [3]): <small>&#x003C;WHEN A WOMAN VOWS A VOW TO THE LORD&#x003E; AND BINDS HERSELF WITH A BOND &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E;</small> Therefore, one cannot break his oath.</p>
<title>8.7 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part VII</title>
<p>And so you find, when they sought to get rid of a yoke in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1): <small>SOME</small> &#x007B;<small>CHILDREN</small>&#x007D; [<small>ELDERS</small>] <small>OF ISRAEL CAME TO CONSULT THE LORD</small>. They said to him: Son of Adam, when a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the <italic>terumah</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1446">11</xref></sup> He said to them: He may eat it. They said to him: If a priest returned and sold him to an &#x003C;ordinary&#x003E; Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction? He told them: Yes. &#x007B;He said to them:&#x007D; [They said to him:] If we leave the jurisdiction of the Holy One, do we become like the peoples of the world? Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32&#x2013;33): <small>BUT THAT WHICH YOU HAVE IN MIND SHALL NEVER COME TO PASS, THAT SHOULD YOU SAY: LET US BECOME LIKE THE GENTILES&#x2026;. AS I LIVE, SAYS</small> [<small>THE LORD</small>] <small>GOD, SURELY I WILL REIGN OVER YOU</small> [<small>WITH A POWERFUL HAND, WITH AN OUTSTRETCHED ARM</small>,] <small>AND WITH WRATH POURED FORTH</small> &#x007B;<small>AND WITH A POWERFUL ARM</small>&#x007D;. He said to them: As long as one has not sold &#x003C;a slave&#x003E;, he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price. It is so stated (in Is. 52:3): [<small>FOR</small>] <small>THUS SAYS THE LORD: YOU WERE SOLD FOR FREE, &#x003C;AND YOU SHALL BE REDEEMED FOR NO MONEY&#x003E;</small>.</p>
<title>8.8 Deuteronomy 29:9 [10]ff., Part VIII</title>
<p>(Deut. 29:12 [13]:) <small>IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE</small>&#x2026;, i.e., so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to their ancestors. Deut. 29:13 [14]): <small>AND NOT ONLY WITH YOU &#x003C;HAVE I MADE THIS COVENANT AND THIS OATH&#x003E;</small>, but the generations that have yet to come were also there, as stated (in vs. 14 [15]): <small>BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE &#x003C;STANDING</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>MD</small></italic>)<small>&#x003E; HERE WITH US &#x003C;TODAY&#x003E; &#x2026; AND WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY</small>. Now why does it say: <small>THOSE WHO ARE &#x003C;STANDING</small> (&#x2018;<italic><small>MD</small></italic>)<small>&#x003E; HERE</small>? And why does it say: <small>THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE</small> (without using the word <small>STANDING</small>)? Because all the souls were there, &#x003C;even&#x003E; when &#x003C;their&#x003E; bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason &#x003C;their&#x003E; existence (literally: standing, rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>MD</small></italic>) is not stated here. R. Eleazar said: A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30): <small>WHY DID YOU STEAL MY GODS</small>? It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself [from theft]. How could it save others?<sup><xref rid="fn1447">12</xref></sup> But Israel is not like that, as stated (in Deut. 10:21): <small>HE IS YOUR PRAISE, AND HE IS YOUR GOD, &#x003C;WHO HAS DONE THESE GREAT AND AWFUL THINGS FOR YOU THAT YOUR OWN EYES HAVE SEEN&#x003E;</small>. He also watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4): <small>BEHOLD THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP</small>.</p>

<title>10.1 Deuteronomy 32:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, AND LET ME SPEAK; LET THE EARTH HEAR THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 16:26): <small>THE SOUL OF A LABORER LABORS FOR HIM, BECAUSE HIS MOUTH</small> (i.e., hunger) <small>URGES HIM ON</small>. Why did Moses call to the heavens and the earth at the time of his passing away?<sup><xref rid="fn1448">1</xref></sup> &#x003C;It was&#x003E; simply to teach you that he called them to charge them concerning himself. He said to them: Behold, the Holy One has decreed over me that I am to die. Set your mind on how you will receive me in glory, so that you look at me, as if I were alive and speaking words of Torah for the world. (Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small> to what I have already told you (in Deut. 4:26): <small>I HAVE CALLED HEAVEN AND EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY</small>. See to it that you do not accuse<sup><xref rid="fn1449">2</xref></sup> Israel after my death,<sup><xref rid="fn1450">3</xref></sup> but be mindful in this way, as if I were alive, standing up to ask mercy for Israel.</p>
<title>10.2 Deuteronomy 32:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Deut. 32:1:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, &#x003C;&#x2026;&#x003E;; LET THE EARTH HEAR&#x2026;.</small>] Isaiah said (in Is. 1:2): <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS, AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>. What was the reason for Isaiah saying: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS, AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>? &#x003C;It was&#x003E; simply to teach you that all the words of the prophets are equivalent. Moses said: <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small>, and Isaiah said: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS</small>. R. Aqiva said: &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that when Moses uttered the Torah, he was in the heavens, and that he speaks with the heavens like one who is speaking with his friend, since he said: <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS</small>. But when he saw that the earth was far from him, he said: <small>LET THE EARTH HEAR THE WORDS OF MY MOUTH</small>. In the case of Isaiah, however, because he was on earth, he said: <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS</small>, [since they were] far from him. After that he said: <small>AND GIVE EAR, O EARTH</small>, because it was near to him.</p>
<p>(Is. 1:2, cont.:) <small>FOR THE LORD HAS SPOKEN</small>. They said to Isaiah: If the Lord had spoken, would not the earth have quaked? Moreover, there is the text (of Ps. 68:9 [8]): <small>THE EARTH QUAKED, AND THE HEAVENS POURED, &#x003C;BECAUSE OF THE GOD OF SINAI, BECAUSE OF GOD, THE GOD OF ISRAEL&#x003E;</small>. The waters also trembled, as stated (in Ps. 93:4): <small>THAN THE ROARINGS OF MANY WATERS</small>. When? &#x003C;When&#x003E; (in Exod. 20:1) <small>GOD SPOKE ALL THESE WORDS, SAYING</small>. If he had spoken with you, would you<sup><xref rid="fn1451">4</xref></sup> have lived? It is comparable to a governor who entered a city. A prefect<sup><xref rid="fn1452">5</xref></sup> of that city came. When the governor came to speak with them, they became bewildered. A certain bumpkin came. The governor said to them: This is my friend, and am accustomed to speak with him. They said to him: We cannot speak with him, but if he is your friend, speak with him on our behalf. Similarly, Israel said to Isaiah: In our case he has called us his children, as stated (in Exod. 4:22): <small>ISRAEL IS MY FIRST-BORN SON</small>. It is also written (in Is. 46:3) <small>&#x003C;HEARKEN UNTO ME, O HOUSE OF JACOB &#x2026;,&#x003E; THE ONES WHO HAVE BEEN BORNE BY ME FROM BIRTH, &#x003C;CARRIED FROM THE WOMB&#x003E;</small>. When he spoke with us at Horeb, our soul departed at his word. Should he speak with us &#x003C;again&#x003E;, we shall die. But you are our master. You draw near and listen, just as Moses our Master did. And what was this protection that Isaiah had? What is stated (in Is. 49:5): <small>AND NOW THE LORD HAS SPOKEN, THE ONE WHO FORMED ME IN THE WOMB TO BE HIS SERVANT&#x2026;.</small> He therefore said (in Is. 32:1:) <small>HEAR, O HEAVENS&#x2026;</small>.</p>
<title>10.3 Deuteronomy 32:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 32:1&#x2013;2:) <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS, &#x003C;&#x2026;.&#x003E; LET MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: When Moses went up to the heights, the angels were about to kill him.<sup><xref rid="fn1453">6</xref></sup> He said to them: Is it because of the two things in my hands that were granted to me from the heavens that you wish to kill me? They left him alone. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a great merchant who was walking in a dangerous place. &#x003C;When some&#x003E; brigands<sup><xref rid="fn1454">7</xref></sup> seized him &#x003C;and&#x003E; wanted to kill him, he said to them: Is it because of the five minas<sup><xref rid="fn1455">8</xref></sup> in my hand that you wish to kill me? But they did not know that there were in his hand precious stones and pearls,<sup><xref rid="fn1456">9</xref></sup> which were invaluable. They said to each other: What profit is there in killing him? He has nothing on him. So they left him alone. When he entered the city, he began to sell precious stones and pearls. They said to him: When we captured you yesterday, you said: There is nothing on me but five minas; but now you are bringing out precious stones and pearls. He said to them: When I spoke to you, I was in a dangerous situation. So also did Moses our Master say to the angels: There are two things in my hand. &#x003C;In fact&#x003E; there was in his hand a great gift, as stated (in Ps. 68:19 [18]): <small>YOU ASCENDED ON HIGH; YOU CAPTURED CAPTIVES; YOU RECEIVED GIFTS FOR HUMANS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1457">10</xref></sup> <small>&#x003C;EVEN THOSE WHO REBEL AGAINST THE LORD GOD</small>&#x2019;s <small>ABIDING THERE&#x003E;</small>. Therefore David said (in Ps. 119:72): <small>THE LAW OF YOUR MOUTH IS BETTER FOR ME THAN THOUSANDS OF GOLD AND SILVER PIECES</small>. It also says (in Ps. 19:11 [10]): <small>MORE DELIGHTFUL ARE THEY THAN GOLD, THAN MUCH FINE GOLD</small> &#x2026;; and it says (in Ps. 12:7 <bold>[6]):</bold> <small>THE SAYINGS OF THE LORD ARE PURE SAYINGS</small>. Israel said to Moses our Master: Blessed are you, for your having received gifts. He said to them: If I had not said to the ministering angels that there were two things, I should have been burned by their fire, but this Torah saved me from their hand. It was with reference to them that he said (in Deut. 32:2): <small>LET MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN. DROP DOWN</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RP</small></italic>) must mean killing, since it is stated (in Deut. 21:4): <small>AND THEY SHALL BREAK THE NECK</small> (rt.: &#x2018;<italic><small>RP</small></italic>) <small>OF THE HEIFER THERE</small>; and <small>INSTRUCTION</small> must mean Torah, since it is stated (in Prov. 4:2): <small>FOR I GAVE YOU GOOD INSTRUCTION</small>.</p>
<title>10.4 Deuteronomy 32:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 32:2): <small>LET &#x003C;MY INSTRUCTION DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN</small>. Israel said to Moses our Master: You have not come to speak with heaven and earth but with the rain and the dew. It is comparable to a wealthy person who went to honor the King. He took with him great princes and people of honor. He went into the king along with them, and the king received them cordially. So also did Moses say: It is better for me to call for heaven and earth, the rain and the dew to be with me, so that when I call upon the Holy One, he will answer me. For that reason he said to them (in Deut. 32:1&#x2013;3): <small>GIVE EAR, O HEAVENS&#x2026;. LET &#x003C;MY INSTRUCTION&#x003E; DROP DOWN LIKE THE RAIN&#x2026;. FOR I AM PROCLAIMING THE NAME OF THE LORD</small>.</p>

<title>11.1 Deuteronomy 33:1ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 33:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>. This text is related (to Prov. 31:29): <small>MANY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE VALIANTLY, BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL</small>. This is the blessing of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn1458">1</xref></sup> in respect to which you should note that in the case of the earlier generations each and every one blessed his generation, but compared to all of them none was like the blessing of Moses. Noah blessed his children, but it contained a divergence. He blessed one and cursed another. (Gen. 9:27:) <small>MAY GOD ENLARGE</small> (<italic><small>YPT</small></italic>) <small>JAPHETH</small> (<italic><small>YPT</small></italic>); but he said (vs. 25:) <small>CURSED BE CANAAN</small>. Isaac blessed Jacob. There was strife in it, in that he said to Esau (in Gen. 27:35): <small>YOUR BROTHER CAME WITH DECEIT</small>; and it is stated (in vs. 41): <small>THEN ESAU HATED JACOB &#x003C;&#x2026;, AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART: LET THE DAYS OF MORNING FOR MY FATHER COME, AND I WILL KILL MY BROTHER JACOB&#x003E;</small>. Jacob blessed the tribes, but there was strife among them, in that he said to Reuben (in Gen. 49:4): <small>UNSTABLE AS WATER</small>; and similarly (in vs. 5): <small>SIMEON AND LEVI &#x003C;ARE BROTHERS; WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE ARE THEIR SWORDS&#x003E;</small>. And from where did each and every one of the patriarchs learn to bless his generation? [They learned] from the Holy One. When he created Adam, he blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED THEM</small>; [and<sup><xref rid="fn1459">2</xref></sup> the world was maintained by that blessing, until the generation of the flood came, and they cancelled it out, as stated (in Gen. 6:7): <small>AND THE LORD SAID: I WILL BLOT OUT THE HUMANITY WHICH I CREATED</small>. When Noah left the ark, the Holy One saw that this blessing had passed from them. He blessed Noah and his children anew, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): <small>THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN</small>. The world was maintained by this blessing, until Abraham came into the world. Then the Holy One added one blessing for him, as stated (in Gen. 12:2): <small>FOR I WILL MAKE YOU INTO A GREAT NATION&#x2026;</small>. When Abraham came, the Holy One said: It is not a practice worthy of me, that I should be obliged to bless my creatures. Rather take note&#x0021; I am handing over the blessings to Abraham and to his seed, so that for all who issue a blessing through him, I am placing my seal upon &#x003C;those blessings&#x003E;, as stated (in vs. 2, cont.): <small>&#x003C;I WILL BLESS YOU AND MAGNIFY YOUR NAME&#x003E; AND SO BECOME A BLESSING</small>. (vs. 3:) <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU&#x2026;</small>. What is the meaning of <small>I WILL BLESS THOSE WHO BLESS YOU</small>. The Holy One said: Take note. I am handing over the blessings to <small>ALL WHOM YOU BLESS</small>, and I am sealing &#x003C;them&#x003E; through you. But if from then on the blessings were &#x007B;spoken&#x007D; [handed over] to Abraham, why did he not bless Isaac? It was because Abraham saw that Esau would issue from him. He said: If I bless Isaac, then Esau will be blessed, and Isaac will be found lacking. A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the head of a household that had a vineyard.<sup><xref rid="fn1460">3</xref></sup>: He gave it to a tenant. And in that vineyard was a tree of life, but it had overgrown a tree having a deadly poison. Now he did not know what to do. He said: If I cultivate that vineyard, then the tree having a deadly poison will flourish; but if I do not cultivate that vineyard, then the tree of life will die. So what shall I do? I will bear with that vineyard until the owner of the vineyard comes. Then he may do what he wants with his vineyard.<sup><xref rid="fn1461">4</xref></sup> And so also did Abraham say: If I bless Isaac, Esau will end up being blessed and Jacob will lose out. Look here. It is simply that he is leaving him alone until the Holy One comes, when he will deal with what belongs to him.] Jacob came and received five blessing: two from his father, one from Abraham, one from the angel, and one from the Holy One.<sup><xref rid="fn1462">5</xref></sup>: Two from his father, according to what is stated (in Gen. 27:33): <small>THEN ISAAC TREMBLED</small> (when he realized he had blessed Jacob instead of Esau). Why <small>TREMBLED</small>? R. Eleazar ben Padat said: &#x003C;He did so&#x003E; because he saw Gehinnom open for Esau. He wanted to say: Cursed. He repented and added a blessing when he said (ibid., end): <small>HE ALSO SHALL BE BLESSED</small>. Here is one blessing. A second (is in Gen. 28:1): <small>SO ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM</small>. [The blessing of Abraham (is in Gen. 28:4): <small>AND MAY HE GRANT YOU THE BLESSING OF ABRAHAM</small>&#x2026;; the blessing of an angel is (in Gen. 32:30 [29]): <small>AND HE</small> (the angel) <small>BLESSED HIM THERE</small>; and the blessings of the Holy One (in Gen. 35:9): <small>NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN&#x2026;, AND BLESSED HIM</small>.] When Jacob came to bless the tribes, he blessed them with the five blessing that he had in hand and added one blessing to them, as stated (in Gen. 49:28): <small>ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, &#x003C;TWELVE IN NUMBER, AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM&#x003E; WHEN HE BLESSED THEM, EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING IS HOW HE BLESSED THEM</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1463">6</xref></sup> When Moses came to bless Israel, he added a seventh blessing to them. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 33:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>. &#x003C; According to another interpretation, Moses made&#x003E; an addition to the blessings with which Balaam had blessed Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1464">7</xref></sup> since it was fitting for him to bless with seven blessings corresponding to the seven altars &#x003C;he had built&#x003E;;<sup><xref rid="fn1465">8</xref></sup> but &#x003C;Balaam&#x003E; only blessed them with three, as stated (in Numb. 24:10): <small>BUT HERE YOU HAVE EVEN BLESSED THEM THESE THREE</small> [<small>TIMES</small>]. The Holy One said to him: You are wicked. Your eye is too jaundiced for you to bless them. Moreover, I am not putting the power in your hand to finish your blessing over Israel. Moses will come, whose eye is fair. Then he will bless Israel, and it is about him that Solomon has said (in Prov. 22:9): <small>HE THAT HAS A BENEVOLENT EYE SHALL BE BLESSED</small> (<italic><small>YBRK</small></italic>). Do not read <italic><small>YBRK</small></italic> &#x003C;with vowels meaning&#x003E; <small>SHALL BE BLESSED</small>, but &#x003C;with vowels meaning&#x003E; <small>SHALL BLESS</small>. This refers to Moses our Master whose eyes were fair when he blessed Israel. He also blessed them with &#x003C;the other&#x003E; four blessings:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is (in Exod. 39:43): <small>WHEN MOSES SAW ALL THE WORK &#x2026;; HE BLESSED THEM</small>.</li>
<li>The second is (in Lev. 9:23): <small>THEN MOSES AND AARON CAME UNTO THE TENT OF MEETING; AND WHEN THEY CAME OUT, THEY BLESSED THE PEOPLE&#x2026;</small>.</li>
<li>The third is (in Deut. 1:11): <small>MAY THE LORD GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN YOU ARE AND BLESS YOU</small>.</li>
<li>The fourth is (here in Deut. 33:1): <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING</small>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is therefore stated (in Prov. 31:29): <small>MANY DAUGHTERS HAVE DONE VALIANTLY, BUT YOU SURPASS THEM ALL</small>.</p>
<title>11.2 Deuteronomy 33:1ff, Part II</title>
<p>(Deut. 33:1:) <small>AND THIS IS THE BLESSING, WITH WHICH MOSES, &#x003C;THE MAN OF GOD,&#x003E; BLESSED &#x003C;THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEFORE HIS DEATH&#x003E;</small>. It was fitting for Moses to bless Israel because he had constantly risked his life for them.<sup><xref rid="fn1466">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 33:1:) <small>THE MAN OF GOD</small>. Resh Laqish said: If it were not in Scripture, it would be impossible to say this:<sup><xref rid="fn1467">10</xref></sup> Just as when a man gives an order to his wife, she carries it out; so when the Holy One gave an order to Moses, he carried it out for him.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 33:1:) <small>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</small>. It was Israel&#x2019;s merit that enabled him.</p>
<p>(Deut. 33:1:) <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>. Would it cross your mind that he blessed Israel after he died?<sup><xref rid="fn1469">12</xref></sup>: Then what is the meaning of <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>? Before the Angel of Death. When the Holy One said to him (in Deut. 32:49-50) <small>ASCEND &#x003C;THIS MOUNTAIN OF THE ABARIM&#x003E;&#x2026;; AND YOU SHALL DIE ON THIS MOUNTAIN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">13</xref></sup> The Angel of Death thought that the Holy One had already given him authority over Moses&#x2019; life. He came and stood directly above him. Moses said to him: The Holy One has already promised me that he would not deliver me into your hand. Then he blessed Israel before the Angel of Death. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 33:1) <small>BEFORE HIS DEATH</small>.</p>
<title>11.3 Deuteronomy 33:1ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 33:2:) <small>THEN HE SAID: THE LORD CAME FROM SINAI&#x2026;</small>. &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches you that the Holy One brought the Torah around to the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn1471">14</xref></sup> but they would not accept it, until he came to Israel; and they did accept it. Thus it is stated (ibid., cont.): <small>AND HE SHONE UPON THEM FROM SEIR</small>. These are the children of Esau, in that they were children of Seir. (ibid., cont.:) <small>HE APPEARED FROM MOUNT PARAN</small>. These are the children of Ishmael, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 21:21): <small>HE DWELT IN THE WILDERNESS OF PARAN</small>. It is also written (in Hab. 3:6): <small>HE AROSE AND MEASURED THE EARTH; HE LOOKED AND MADE NATIONS TREMBLE</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>, literally: <small>LEAP</small>). When he saw that they did not want to accept the Torah, he made them jump into Gehinnom, even as it says (in Lev. 11:21): <small>&#x003C;KNEE JOINTS ABOVE THEIR FEET&#x003E; TO LEAP</small> (rt.: <italic><small>NTR</small></italic>) <small>WITH UPON THE GROUND</small>. It also says in another place (in Ps. 138:4): <small>ALL THE KINGS OF THE EARTH SHALL GIVE THANKS TO YOU, O LORD, FOR THEY HAVE HEARD THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH</small>. But we still need to say: Perhaps they wanted to heed. Micah the Morashtite came and put an end to the matter, where it is stated (in Micah 5:14 [15]): I<small>N ANGER AND WRATH WILL I EXECUTE RETRIBUTION ON THE NATIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT OBEYED</small>. &#x007B;&#x2026;.&#x007D;: Here you learn that they did not want to receive the Torah. David came and gave thanks to the Holy One over this, where it is stated (in Ps. 77:15 [14]): <small>YOU ARE THE GOD WHO PERFORMS WONDERS; YOU HAVE MADE YOUR STRENGTH KNOWN AMONG THE PEOPLES</small>. David said: Sovereign of the Universe, O the wonders that you performed when you made your Torah known to the nations of the world&#x0021; <small>YOUR STRENGTH</small> can only be Torah, since it is stated (in Ps. 29:11): <small>THE LORD WILL GRANT STRENGTH TO HIS PEOPLE</small>. R. Abbahu said: It was revealed and made known to the one who spoke and world came into being that the nations of the world would not accept the Torah. Then for what reason did he make them the offer? It is simply that this represents the character of the Holy One. First he made an offer to his creatures, and after that he drove them from the world, because the Holy One does not deal with his creatures in tyranny.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">15</xref></sup> [A second reason for his making them an offer: &#x003C;It was&#x003E; because they were fortunate in their ancestors.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Deut. 33:2, cont.:) <small>HE ARRIVED</small> (&#x2019;<italic><small>T</small></italic>&#x2019;)<sup><xref rid="fn1474">17</xref></sup> <small>FROM HOLY MYRIADS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1475">18</xref></sup>: &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that the Holy One is great and his name is to be praised by all his host, because his attributes are not like the attribute of flesh and blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1476">19</xref></sup> &#x003C;Consider&#x003E; the character of flesh and blood. If the king comes out with his household,<sup><xref rid="fn1477">20</xref></sup> he is handsome; but among his hosts there are some more handsome than he. He is valiant, but among his hosts there some more valiant than he. In the case of the Holy One, however, there is no one like him among all his myriads. It is so stated (in Ps. 86:8): <small>THERE IS NO ONE LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD</small>. It also says (in Exod. 15:11): <small>WHO IS LIKE YOU AMONG THE GODS, O LORD</small>&#x2026;?]</p>
<p>(Deut. 33:2, cont.:) <small>AT HIS RIGHT HAND IS A FIERY LAW</small>. &#x003C;This&#x003E; teaches that the Torah was given only by the right hand.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">21</xref></sup> R. Johanan said: Whoever wants to be engaged with the Torah should see himself as if he were standing in the fire. It is therefore stated (ibid.): <small>A FIERY LAW</small>.</p>
<title>11.4 Deuteronomy 33:1ff, Part IV</title>
<p>(Deut. 33:3:) <small>INDEED HE SHOWS LOVE TO THE PEOPLES</small> (by letting them rule over Israel).<sup><xref rid="fn1479">22</xref></sup> Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, you have placed two yokes upon your children, the yoke of Torah and the yoke of enslavement to empires. The Holy One said to him: Whoever is engaged with the Torah [is delivered from enslavement to empires]. (Ibid., cont.:) <small>ALL HIS HOLY ONES ARE IN YOUR HAND</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 33:3, cont.:) <small>AND THEY ARE POUNDED</small> (rt.: <italic><small>TKH</small></italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1480">23</xref></sup> <small>AT YOUR FEET</small>. Rav Joseph taught: These are the disciples of the sages, who beat (rt.: <italic><small>KTT</small></italic>) their feet from city to city in order to learn Torah and cast off the yoke of empire from upon them.</p>
<p>Another interpretation (of Deut. 33:3): <small>AND THEY ARE POUNDED AT YOUR FEET</small>. Although they are beaten, they do not move from your dwellings, but (ibid., end) <small>THEY TAKE UP YOUR WORDS</small>.</p>
<p>(Deut. 33:4:) <small>MOSES CHARGED US WITH TORAH, AS THE HERITAGE FOR THE CONGREGATION OF ISRAEL</small>. It is a heritage for all the congregations of Jacob, for whoever engages in it for its own sake is worthy of the inheritance of Jacob, as stated (in Is. 58:14): <small>THEN YOU SHALL TAKE DELIGHT IN THE LORD&#x2026;, AND I WILL FEED YOU THE INHERITANCE OF YOUR FATHER JACOB</small>.</p>
<title>11.5 Deuteronomy 31:14ff, Part I</title>
<p>(Deut. 31:14:) <small>THEN THE LORD SAID UNTO MOSES: BEHOLD THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU TO DIE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">24</xref></sup>: This text is related (to Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>?<sup><xref rid="fn1482">25</xref></sup> With reference to whom is this text spoken? It speaks of none other than Moses the Righteous, for there is no one like him, not among the prophets and not among the sages. So here is the Holy One testifying concerning him after his death (in Deut. 34:10): <small>NEVER AGAIN DID THERE ARISE IN ISRAEL A PROPHET LIKE MOSES &#x003C;WHOM THE LORD KNEW FACE TO FACE&#x003E;</small>; still, he did not have the power to save himself from death. David therefore said (in I Chron. 29:15): <small>FOR WE ARE SOJOURNERS BEFORE YOU AND TRANSIENTS LIKE ALL OUR ANCESTORS; OUR DAYS ON THE EARTH ARE LIKE A SHADOW, AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>. But is it not written (in Ps. 37:34): <small>HOPE IN THE LORD AND KEEP HIS WAY, AND HE WILL RAISE YOU UP TO INHERIT THE LAND</small>? So why does the text say (in I Chron. 29:15): <small>AND THERE IS NO HOPE</small>? David said: Sovereign of the Universe, in all circumstances a person has hope. If one is poor, &#x003C;there is hope&#x003E; until he becomes rich. &#x003C;If he is&#x003E; feeble, &#x003C;there is hope&#x003E; until be becomes strong. If he is sick, &#x003C;there is hope&#x003E; until he is healed. If he is confined in prison, &#x003C;there is hope&#x003E; until they free him. On the day of death, however, he has no hope. So here the Holy One spoke with Moses face to face, but he was not able to save himself from death. And so Solomon has said (in Eccl. 9:2): <small>SINCE EVERYTHING &#x003C;HAPPENS&#x003E; TO EVERYONE, THE SAME LOT &#x003C;FALLS&#x003E; TO THE RIGHTEOUS AND TO THE WICKED</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1483">26</xref></sup>: R. Hanina said: In the case of an intercessory spirit,<sup><xref rid="fn1484">27</xref></sup> it has authority to speak before the Holy One. &#x003C;Such a one is&#x003E; like a senator<sup><xref rid="fn1485">28</xref></sup> before the King. So he says to &#x003C;the Holy one&#x003E;: Sovereign of the Universe, all flesh is &#x003C;destined&#x003E; for death. Abraham experienced death; the wicked Nimrod experienced death; Isaac experienced death; Abimelech experienced death; Moses experienced death; the wicked Pharaoh experienced death; for Solomon has stated (in Eccl. 3:20): <small>EVERYONE IS GOING TO THE SAME PLACE</small>. So from now on, what gain is there for the righteous to be engaged with the Torah and good works in this world? And what loss is there for the wicked to sin and cause &#x003C;others&#x003E; to sin in this world? Solomon has the explanation (in vs. 21): <small>WHO KNOWS THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS THAT &#x003C;RISE UPWARD AND THE LIFEBREATH OF THE BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH&#x003E;</small>? <small>THE LIFEBREATH OF HUMANS</small>: These are the spirits of the righteous, because they are put in storage and hidden under the Throne of Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn1486">29</xref></sup> <small>AND THE LIFEBREATH OF THE BEAST THAT GOES DOWN INTO THE EARTH</small>: These are the spirits of the wicked, which go down to Gehinnom. And so it says (in Is. 14:15): <small>YOU SHALL ALSO</small> &#x007B;<small>GO DOWN</small>&#x007D; [<small>BE BROUGHT DOWN</small>] <small>UNTO SHEOL, &#x003C;UNTO THE UTTERMOST PARTS OF THE PIT&#x003E;</small>. But where is it shown that the righteous are called <small>ADAM</small>? Where Jonah says so (in Jonah 4:11): <small>SO SHOULD I NOT TAKE PITY ON NINEVEH, &#x003C;THAT GREAT CITY&#x003E; IN WHICH THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND PERSONS</small> (literally: <small>ADAMS</small>), <small>AND &#x003C;MANY&#x003E; ANIMALS. ADAMS</small>: These are the righteous; <small>AND &#x003C;MANY&#x003E; ANIMALS</small>: These are the wicked, in that their works are like the work of the wicked. It is therefore stated (in Prov. 11:31): <small>BEHOLD, SHALL A RIGHTEOUS ONE BE RECOMPENSED ON EARTH</small>?</p>
<title>11.6 Deuteronomy 3 14ff, Part II</title>
<p>[(Deut. 31:14:) <small>BEHOLD</small> (<italic><small>HN</small></italic>) <small>THE DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR FOR YOU &#x003C;TO DIE&#x003E;</small>. Moses said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the Universe, with the word that I &#x003C;used to&#x003E; praise<sup><xref rid="fn1487">30</xref></sup> you when I said (in Deut. 10:14): <small>BEHOLD</small> (<italic><small>HN</small></italic>) <small>THE HEAVENS &#x003C;AND THE HEAVENS OF THE HEAVENS, THE EARTH AND ALL THAT IS IN IT&#x003E; BELONG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD</small>&#x0021; By that &#x003C;very word&#x003E; (i.e., <italic><small>HN</small></italic>) you have condemned me at death.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">31</xref></sup>: The Holy One said to him: I am bringing about contentment, (as in Deut. 31:16): <small>BEHOLD</small> (<italic><small>HN</small></italic>-) <small>YOU</small> (-<italic><small>K</small></italic>) <small>ARE &#x003C;SOON&#x003E; TO SLEEP WITH YOUR ANCESTORS&#x2026;</small>. R. Abbahu said: The words, <small>BEHOLD YOU</small> (<italic><small>HNK</small></italic>), can only mean contentment, since it is stated (in Job 3:17): <small>THERE</small> (in death) <small>THE WEARY ARE AT REST</small> (<italic>yanuhu,</italic> understood to have the root <italic><small>HNK</small></italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1489">32</xref></sup></p>
<title>11.7 Deuteronomy 31:14ff, Part III</title>
<p>(Deut. 31:14, literally:) <small>BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR &#x003C;TO DIE&#x003E;</small>. R. Joshua ben Levi said: A drawing near is uttered with reference to the ancestors, and a drawing near is uttered with reference to the kings (in I Kings 2:1): <small>THEN WHEN THE DAYS FOR DAVID TO DIE DREW NEAR</small>. With reference to the prophets (there is Moses, whom the Holy One addresses in the second person in Deut. 31:14): <small>BEHOLD YOUR DAYS ARE DRAWING NEAR &#x003C;TO DIE&#x003E;</small>. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said: Do days die? These words are simply a reference to the righteous. When they die, their days pass away from the world, but they themselves remain alive, as stated (in Job 12:10): <small>IN WHOSE HAND IS EVERY LIVING SOUL</small>. If the living are delivered into his hand, are the dead not delivered into his hand? It is simply that these are the righteous, who even in their death are called living.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">33</xref></sup> Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 23:20): <small>AND BENAIAH BEN JEHOIADA, THE SON OF A VALIANT WARRIOR</small> (literally: <small>OF A LIVING PERSON</small>) <small>FROM KAZBEEL, WHO HAD PERFORMED GREAT DEEDS&#x2026;</small>. However, the wicked during their lifetime and in their death are called dead, as stated (in Ezek. 21:30 [25]): <small>AND YOU, O SLAIN WICKED &#x003C; PRINCE OF ISRAEL, WHOSE DAY HAS COME&#x003E;&#x2026;</small>. And so it says (in Deut. 17:6): <small>ON THE EVIDENCE OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES SHALL THE DEAD BE PUT TO DEATH</small>. Does someone dead deserve another death? It is simply that the wicked during life are regarded as dead. For what reason? On seeing the rising sun, such a one does not say the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed Be the One Who Forms the Luminaries.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1491">34</xref></sup> When it sets, he does not say the blessing, &#x201C;Who Brings on Evenings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1492">35</xref></sup>: Nor does he say a blessing when eating or drinking. However, the righteous do say a blessing for each and every &#x003C;one of these&#x003E; things. Moreover, they are uttered, not &#x003C;only&#x003E; while they are alive, but even when they are dead. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 149:5): <small>LET THE SAINTS REJOICE IN GLORY; LET THEM SING FOR JOY UPON THEIR BEDS&#x2026;</small>.</p>
