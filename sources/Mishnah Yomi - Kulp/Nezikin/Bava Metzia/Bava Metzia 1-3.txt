Bava Metzia Chapter One Mishnayoth Three and Four

Introduction
The third and fourth mishnah of our chapter deal with ownership disputes in which two people lay claim to a found object.    

Mishnah Three
If a man was riding on a beast and saw lost property and said to his fellow, “Give it to me”, and the other took it and said, “I have acquired it”, he (the other) has acquired it.
But if after he gave it to him he said, “I acquired it first”, he has said nothing.

Explanation
In the first section of the mishnah a person saw an object while riding on an animal and told his friend to pick it up for him.  When his friend picked it up he claimed it for himself.  According to the mishnah the person who picked it up can claim title to the object.  If, however, the person picked it up and then gave it to his fellow, he cannot subsequently claim title.  The person’s claim to ownership must come at the same time that he actually has possession of the object and not after he has already given it to someone else.
