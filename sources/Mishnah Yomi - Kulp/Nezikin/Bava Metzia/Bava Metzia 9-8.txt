Mishnah Eight
If one leased a field from his fellow with the condition that he sow barley, he may not sow wheat;
[But if he leased the field with the condition that he sow] wheat, he may sow barley.
Rabban Gamaliel forbids this.
If one leased a field from his fellow with the condition that he sow grain, he may not sow beans;
[But if he leased the field with the condition that he sow] beans, he may sow grain.
Rabban Gamaliel forbids this.

Explanation
Both sections of this mishnah in essence teach the same law, so we will explain them together.  If one leased a field with the stipulation that he sow a certain type of produce he may not sow something else that is more damaging to the soil of that field.  He may, however, sow something that is less damaging to the soil.  For instance, if he promised to sow barley he may not sow wheat since wheat is more damaging; but if he promised to sow wheat he may sow barley, since barley is less damaging.  Similarly, if he promised to sow grain he may not sow beans which are more damaging; but if he promised to sow beans he may sow wheat which is less damaging.  This is the anonymous opinion expressed in the first two clauses of each section.  Rabban Gamaliel disagrees and states that one may not change the condition under any circumstance, even if the new seed will be less damaging to the field.  Although there may not be exist a specific reason why in certain cases one should not change the conditions of the agreement, one is in general forbidden to do so.

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah seven:  Why does the mishnah teach both clauses?  What might you have thought had the mishnah taught only the first clause and not the second? What might you have thought had the mishnah taught only the second clause and not the first?
Mishnah eight:  What do you think Rabban Gamaliel would say if the renter asked the ownerâ€™s permission to change the type of seed?  Would he still forbid?
