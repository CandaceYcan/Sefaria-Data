Mishnah Eight
With wine he may exact [a reduction] of one-sixth.
Rabbi Judah says:  “One-fifth.”
He may exact of him three logs in every one hundred logs of oil—one log and a half for sediment and one log and a half for absorption.
If the oil was refined he may not exact for sediment.
If the jars were old he may not exact for absorption.
Rabbi Judah says:  “Also if a man sells to his fellow through the year, the buyer must undertake to accept a reduction of one and a half logs because of sediment.

Explanation
With wine and oil there are no reductions for mice, as there were with produce, but there are reductions due to sediment and absorption in the sides of the clay vessels which were used at the time.  With wine the guardian may exact a reduction of one-sixth or one-fifth according to Rabbi Judah.
With regards to oil it depends on the type of jar and the type of oil.  Regular oil is reduced 1½  per cent due to sediment, but refined oil does not produce any sediment and therefore reductions may not be exacted.  Regulars jars absorb 1½ per cent but old jars, whose sides are more hardened and have already absorbed oil, do not absorb any oil.  Therefore if the jars were old the guardian may not exact a reduction for absorption.
Rabbi Judah adds that not only may a guardian exact a reduction of 1½ per cent the oil returned to the owner, but so too may a person who sells refined oil.  In other words if Reuven tells Shimon that he is selling him 100 logs of oil and then gives him refined oil, he only need give him 98 ½ logs since 1½ logs of regular oil would be worthless sediment anyway. 

Questions for Further Thought:
Mishnah seven, section two:  Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri’s statement (section 2a) seems to be very logical.  What might be the logic behind those who disagree with him (section 2)?
Mishnah eight, section three:  If the seller told the buyer that he was selling him refined oil, would he be allowed to still make a reduction for sediment?
