Bava Metziah Chapter One Mishnayoth Seven and Eight

Introduction
Mishnayoth seven and eight continue to deal with returning lost documents, a topic which was also discussed in the previous mishnah.

Mishnah Seven
If a man found bills of divorce, or writs of emancipation or wills, or deeds of gifts, or receipts, he should not return them, for I might say, “they were written out, and the writer might have changed his mind and decided not to give them.”

Explanation
In this short mishnah are listed types of documents where one person gives something to another person, whether it be a divorce given to a wife by her husband, freedom to a slave from his master, inheritance to an inheritor, a present, or a receipt.  These documents would normally be kept by the recipient.  If one of these was found one might have expected to return it to the recipient, i.e. the wife, slave, etc.  However, the mishnah states that they should not be returned.  Since it is possible that the writer wrote the document and subsequently changed his mind and did not give the document, we cannot be sure that the recipient lost it.
