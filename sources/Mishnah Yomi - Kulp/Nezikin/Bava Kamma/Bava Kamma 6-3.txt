Bava Kamma Chapter Six Mishnah Three


Mishnah Three
1. If a man stacked his sheaves in his fellow’s field without his permission, and the owner of the field’s beast ate the sheaves, he is exempt. If [the beast] was injured by them, the owner of the stack is liable. If he made the stack with his permission, the owner of the field is liable.


Mishnah Three
This mishnah contains laws that were all learned previously in chapter five mishnah three.  We will just summarize.  If someone brings his belongings onto another’s property without permission and his belongings are damaged there, the property owner is not liable.  If the belongings damage the other person’s property he will be liable.   However, the reverse will be true if he brings the belongings with the other person’s permission.

Questions for Further Thought:
What might be another way of explaining mishnah one section two?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different explanations?
In mishnah two why is Rabbi Shimon’s assessment of damages a higher assessment?
