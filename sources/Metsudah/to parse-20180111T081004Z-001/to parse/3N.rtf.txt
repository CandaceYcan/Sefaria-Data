@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*5>5@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>This prayer is an abbreviated form of the @hh<HEB>àÇäÂáÈä øÇáÌÈä@eeENG prayer in the morning service.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*18>18@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>We particularly ask of Him at night to bless us with wise counsel. Daytime is the time for achievement, but the rest that comes with nightfall is made to allow man to compose his thoughts. By virtue of the complete relaxation it affords, sleep endows the mind and spirit with renewed vigor. We pray therefore for Divine aid so that our nightly rest will help us take wise counsel and affirm worthy resolution for future days.<IT>Avudraham<ITC> and <IT>Siach Yitzchak<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*19>19@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Shield us from trouble before it comes, and remove it from us if it has already come.<IT>Siach Yitzchak<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*20>20@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The Hebrew word @hh<HEB>ùÒÈèÈï@eeENG (Satan) used in the Prayer Book refers to the Evil Impulse, the lower passions which are a hindrance to mans pursuit of the nobler aims in life. It is against the dominance of this impulse that the Jew prays. The adversary, therefore, is any person, spirit, or Evil Impulse that seduces us to do wrong.<IT>Dover Sholom<ITC> and others
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*21>21@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Up to this point the Shabbos Maariv Service is identical to the week night services. Since this Friday evening prayer is the point of transition to the Shabbos <IT>Shemoneh Esrei,<ITC> the concluding phrase of this blessing is changed from @hh<HEB>ùÑåÉîÅø rÇîåÉ éÄùÒÀøÈàÅì ìÈrÇã@eeENG, Who guards His people Israel forever, for the Shabbos does not require protection. The Shabbos itself protects the Jew and causes every thought of grief and anxiety to fade away. It brings us the blissful sense of security that we lack during the week when we feel the need for protection.
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*22>22@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Exodus<ITC> 31:1617. This is merely metaphorical, since God of course does not become tired, nor does He require rest.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*24>24@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The first three and the last three blessings of <IT>Shemoneh Esrei<ITC> are identical in all Sabbath services as well as in the regular weekday <IT>Shemoneh Esrei.<ITC> The intermediate blessing, however, differs in each of the four Sabbath services. The thirteen petitions which make up the intermediate blessings of the weekday <IT>Shemoneh Esrei<ITC> are omitted because prayers for personal needs are not recited on the Sabbath and Festivals. In reciting such personal requests one is reminded of his troubles and shortcomings, and our Sabbaths are not to be desecrated by sadness and misery.
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*25>25@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The earthly hosts include all vegetation, all the living creatures, and mankind; while the heavenly hosts are the sun, moon, all the stars, and even the celestial beings such as angels.<IT>Ramban<ITC>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*27>27@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>God in His goodness, renews every day, continually the work of creation. On the Sabbath, however, God ceased even from His work of renewal.
