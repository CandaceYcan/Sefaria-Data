@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*29>29@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Radak<ITC> writes that the Hebrew word @hh<HEB>ãÄìÄéúÈğÄé@eeENG is an expression used to describe either a downtrodden or an uplifted state. The downtrodden state of the Jewish people is actually part of their uplifting says the <IT>Sfas Emes,<ITC> as it is said, when I was brought low, He delivered me (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 116:6). My downtrodden state was the cause of my salvation, proclaims David, just as when one lowers a bucket (@hh<HEB>ãÀìÄé@eeENG) into a well in order to bring up the water.

The verb @hh<HEB>ìÀñÇôÌÅø@eeENG means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the @hh<HEB>ùÑÈîÇéÄí@eeENG recount the fact that long ago God created a glorious universe. The @hh<HEB>øÈ÷ÄérÇ@eeENG, on the other hand, relates that Gods handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*45>45@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The Talmud (<IT>Sanhedrin<ITC> 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but God formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike.
