@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*41>41@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Isaiah<ITC> 6:3. <IT>Targum Yonoson<ITC> paraphrases this verse: Holy [is God] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity. The Talmud, (<IT>Maseches Chulin<ITC> 91b) refers to this verse as the Sanctification of the Angels. According to <IT>Avudraham<ITC> and <IT>Yaavetz,<ITC> this <IT>Kedushah<ITC> has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that God relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*43>43@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Ezekiel<ITC> 3:12. According to the <IT>Kuzari,<ITC> Gods glory is a euphemism for God Himself. Thus the verse means, Blessed is Adonoy from His place, conveying this concept: God is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the <IT>Kuzari<ITC> is that Gods glory includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Gods glory similar to a kings retinue which is his royal splendor.<QL>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*49>49@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.<IT>Kuzari<ITC><QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*50>50@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The <IT>Kuzari<ITC> writes, When reciting the blessing Unbounded Love @hh<HEB>‡«‰¬·»‰ ¯«·Ã»‰@eeENG, one should bear in mind that Gods Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Gods will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.<QL>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*59>59@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Deuteronomy<ITC> 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter.

Interestingly, the last letter of the first word @hh<HEB>˘—¿Ó«Ú@eeENG and last letter of @hh<HEB>‡∆Á»„@eeENG are written larger than the others.

<EM><EN>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all ones thought on Gods unity. The last word, @hh<HEB>‡∆Á»„@eeENG One, is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that God, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Israel, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.<QL>

Ben Lakish explained that Jacob said Blessed [is His] Name in response to his sons exclamation. The Sages wondered, Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moses did not say it?
