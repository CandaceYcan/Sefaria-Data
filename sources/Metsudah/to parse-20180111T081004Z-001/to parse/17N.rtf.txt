This verse consists of thirteen Hebrew words. It recalls the thirteen attributes of Divine mercy (<IT>Exodus<ITC> 34:67). In the evening when man pauses from the rush of his daily activities, he is conscious of having sinned during the day, and thus begins his prayer with this appeal for Divine mercy.<IT>Machzor Vitry<ITC><QL>
@sn<EM><EN>Midrash Tanchuma (<IT>Pinchos<ITC> 13) notes that the morning sacrifice (@hh<HEB>˙Ã»ÓƒÈ„ ˘—∆Ï ˘—«Á«¯@eeENG) atoned for sins committed during the night, while the afternoon sacrifice (@hh<HEB>˙Ã»ÓƒÈ„ ˘—∆Ï ·Ã≈ÈÔ ‰»r«¯¿·Ã«ÈƒÌ@eeENG) atoned for sins committed during the day. Since the evening service does not represent Temple sacrifice, it became customary to recite this verse because it mentions that God atones iniquity.<IT>Avudraham<ITC><QL>
