@ky<IL0><IR0>All Israel have a share in the World to Come, as it is said: And all your people will be righteous; they will inherit the land forever; they are My plants, the work of My hands, wherein I glory [<IT>Isaiah<ITC> 60:21].<QL>
@pc<IL12><IR12>@p1<*2>@pcChapter 1<QC>
@p1<IL0><IR0>1:1<LT><EM>Moses received the Torah at Sinai and transmitted it to Joshua, and Joshua to the Elders, and the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets handed it down to the Members of the Great Assembly. They [the latter] stated three principles: Be deliberate in judgment; educate many disciples; and set protective bounds for the Torah.<QL>
@p2<*3>1:2<LT><EM>Shimon the Righteous was one of the last survivors of the Great Assem bly. He used to say: The world is based upon three principles: On the Torah; on serving God; and on acts of loving kindness.<QL>
@p2<*4>1:3<LT><EM>Antignos of Socho received the tradition from Shimon the Righteous. He used to say: Be not like the servants who serve the master on the condition of receiving reward. Rather, be as servants who serve the master without the condition of receiving reward; And let the fear of Heaven be upon you.<QL>
@p2<*5>1:4<LT><EM>Yos? ben Yoezer of Tzeredah and Yos? ben Yochanan of Jerusalem received the tradition from them. Yos? ben Yoezer of Tzeredah says: Let your house be a meeting place for the Sages and sit in the dust of their feet, and drink in their words with thirst.<QL>
@p2<*6>1:5<LT><EM>Yos? ben Yochanan of Jerusalem says: Let your house be open wide and let the poor be like members of your household, and do not engage in too much conversation with women. This has been said even with regard to ones own wife, how much more does this apply to his neighbors wife. Accordingly, the Sages said: whoever engages in too much conversation with women, brings evil upon himself, neglects the study of Torah and in the end will inherit Gehennom.<QL>
@p2<*7>1:6<LT><EM>Yehoshua ben Perachya and Nittai the Arbelite received the tradition from them. Yehoshua ben Perachya says: Provide yourself with a teacher, acquire for yourself a companion and judge all men meritoriously.<QL>
@p2<*8>1:7<LT><EM>Nittai the Arbelite says: Keep far from an evil neighbor, do not associate with a wicked man, and do not abandon the belief in retribution.<QL>
@p2<*9>1:8<LT><EM>Yehudah ben Tabbai and Shimon ben Shatach received the tradition from them. Yehudah ben Tabbai says: Do not [if you are a judge] play the part of a counselor; when the parties in a lawsuit stand before you, regard them as wicked; but when they leave, regard them as innocent once they have accepted the judgment.<QL>
@p2<*10>1:9<LT><EM>Shimon ben Shatach says: Examine the witnesses thoroughly, and be careful with your words lest through them they learn to lie.<QL>
@p2<*11>1:10<LT><EM>Shemayah and Avtalyon received the tradition from them. Shemayah says: Love work, scorn the holding of public office, and do not seek to become intimate with the authorities.<QL>
@p2<*12>1:11<LT><EM>Avtalyon says: Scholars, be careful with your words, for you may incur the penalty of Galuth (exile) and be exiled to a place of evil waters, and the disciples who follow you will drink of them and die, and thus the Name of Heaven would be profaned.<QL>
@p2<*13>1:12<LT><EM>Hillel and Shammai received the tradition from them. Hillel says: Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving your fellow men, and drawing them near to the Torah.<QL>
@p2<*14>1:13<LT><EM>He used to say: He who seeks greater reputation loses his reputation. He who does not increase his knowledge decreases it. He who does not study deserves death. And he who puts the crown (of Torah) to his own use shall perish.<QL>
@p2<*15>1:14<LT><EM>He used to say: If I do not do for myself, who will do it for me? And if I care only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?<QL>
@p2<*16>1:15<LT><EM>Shammai says: Make your study of Torah a regular practice, say little and do much, and receive all men with a cheerful countenance.<QL>
@p2<*17>1:16<LT><EM>Rabban Gamliel says: Provide yourself with a teacher and free yourself of doubt, and do not give extra tithe because of guesswork.<QL>
@p2<*18>1:17<LT><EM>Shimon his son says: All my life, I was brought up among the Sages and I have not found anything better for a person than silence. Study is not the most important thing but practice is, and too much talk brings sin.<QL>
@p2<*19>1:18<LT><EM>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The world is sustained by virtue of three principles; by truth, by justice, and by peace, as it is said: You shall administer truth, justice and peace in your gates (<IT>Zechariah<ITC> 8:16).<QL>
@pc<IL12><IR12>@p1<*20>@pcChapter 2<QC>
@p1<IL0><IR0><*21>2:1<LT><EM>Rebbe says: Which is the right course that a man should choose for himself? One which is a credit to the person who chooses it and which also earns him respect from his fellow man. Be careful to perform a minor mitzvah in the same manner as a major one for you do not know the reward for each mitzvah. Consider the loss incurred in the performance of a mitzvah against the reward secured by its observance, and the gain received from a sin against the loss which will be suffered. Reflect upon three things and you will not come into the clutches of sin. Know what is above you: An eye that sees, an ear that hears, and a book in which all your deeds are recorded.<QL>
@p2<*22>2:2<LT><EM>Rabban Gamliel, the son of Rabbi Yehudah haNasi, says: The study of Torah combined with a worldly occupation is an excellent thing, for the energy needed by both keeps sinful thoughts out of ones mind. And any study of Torah when not accompanied by a trade must fail in the end and become the cause of sin. Let all those who occupy themselves with the affairs of the community do so only for the sake of Heaven, for then the merit of their fathers will help them, and their righteousness will last forever. And as for you (says God), I credit you with great reward as if you had achieved it all.<QL>
@p2<*23>2:3<LT><EM>Be cautious of the ruling authorities because they befriend a person only for their own interests. They appear as friends when it is to their own advantage but they do not stand by a person in the time of his distress.<QL>
@p2<*24>2:4<LT><EM>He used to say: Do the will of God as if it were your own, so that He will do your will as if it were His will. Nullify your will for the sake of His will so that He will nullify the will of others for your sake. Hillel said: Do not separate yourself from the community. Do not be sure of yourself until the day of your death. Do not judge your fellow man until you have been in his position. Do not say anything unless its full meaning and implications are understood immediately. And do not say, When I have leisure time I will study, for you may never have leisure.<QL>
@p2<*25>2:5<LT><EM>He used to say: An uncultivated person can have no fear of sin; a man lacking instruction cannot be pious; a bashful person cannot learn; and a person without patience cannot teach. One too deeply involved in business cannot become a scholar, and where there are no men, strive to be a man.<QL>
@p2<*26>2:6<LT><EM>He saw a skull floating on the surface of the water. He said to it: They have drowned you because you drowned others, and those who drowned you will themselves be drowned.<QL>
@p2<*27>2:7<LT><EM>He used to say: The more flesh, the more worms; the more property, the more worry; the more wives, the more superstition; the more maidservants, the more lewdness; the more menservants, the more robbery; the more Torah [study] the more life; the more study, the more wisdom; the more counsel, the more understanding; the more charity, the more peace. One who has acquired a good name, has acquired it for himself; one who has acquired the knowledge of Torah, has acquired life of the World to Come.<QL>
@p2<*28>2:8<LT><EM>Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai received the tradition from Hillel and Shammai. He used to say: If you have learned a great deal of Torah, do not pride yourself on it, because you were created for this purpose. Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai had five disciples (of special excellence) whose names were: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananyah, Rabbi Yos? the Kohen, Rabbi Shimon ben Nesanel and Rabbi Elazar ben Arach. He used to enumerate their merits: Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkenos is a cemented cistern which does not lose a drop. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananyahhappy is she who bore him. Rabbi Yos? the Kohen is pious. Rabbi Shimon ben Nesanel is one who fears sin. Rabbi Elazar ben Arach is like a spring which steadily increases its flow. He used to say: If all the Sages of Israel were on one scale of the balance and Eliezer ben Horkenos on the other, he would outweigh them all. Abba Shaul said in his name: If all the Sages of Israel including Eliezer ben Horkenos were on one scale of the balance and Elazar ben Arach on the other, he would outweigh them all.<QL>
@p2<*29>2:9<LT><EM>He said to them: Go out and see which is the best trait a person should acquire. Rabbi Eliezer said: A good eye. Rabbi Yehoshua said: A good friend. Rabbi Yos? said: A good neighbor. Rabbi Shimon said: One who considers the consequences of an action. Rabbi Elazar said: A good heart. He said to them: I prefer the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Arach to yours, because your answers are included in his words. He said to them: Go out and see which evil trait a person should shun. Rabbi Eliezer said: An evil eye. Rabbi Yehoshua said: A bad friend. Rabbi Yos? said: A bad neighbor. Rabbi Shimon said: One who borrows and does not repay. Borrowing from man is the same as borrowing from God, for it is said: A wicked person borrows and does not repay, but a righteous person deals graciously and gives [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 37:21]. Rabbi Elazar said: An evil heart. He said to them: I prefer the words of Rabbi Elazar ben Arach to yours, because your words are included in his words.<QL>
@p2<*30>2:10<LT><EM>They each said three things. Rabbi Eliezer said: Your friends honor should be as precious to you as your own, and do not be easily moved to anger. Repent the day before you die. Warm yourself by the fire of the Sages but beware of their glowing coals so you will not be burned; because their bite is like that of a fox, their sting is like that of a scorpion, their hiss is like that of a serpent, and all their words are like fiery coals.<QL>
@p2<*31>2:11<LT><EM>Rabbi Yehoshua says: The evil eye, the evil impulse, and hatred of mankind shorten a persons life.<QL>
@p2<*32>2:12<LT><EM>Rabbi Yos? says: Your friends property should be as precious to you as your own. Discipline yourself to study Torah because the knowledge of Torah does not come to you by inheritance; and all your deeds should be done to honor God.<QL>
@p2<*33>2:13<LT><EM>Rabbi Shimon says: Be careful in reading the Shema and the Shemoneh Esrei (<IT>Amidah<ITC>). When you pray, do not regard your prayer as a fixed, mechan ical routine but as an appeal for mercy and grace before God, as it is said: For He is gracious and full of mercy, slow to anger and abundant in loving kind ness, and relenting of the evil decree [<IT>Joel<ITC> 2:13]. And do not consider yourself a wicked person.<QL>
@p2<*34>2:14<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar says: Be diligent to study the Torah, and know what to answer one who is scornful of the Law. And know before Whom you toil; Your Employer is trustworthy and will pay you the reward for your labor.<QL>
@p2<*35>2:15<LT><EM>Rabbi Tarfon says: The day is short, the task is great, the workers are lazy, the reward is great and the Master is insistent.<QL>
@p2<*36>2:16<LT><EM>He used to say: You are not expected to complete the work and yet you are not free to evade it. If you have studied a great deal of Torah, you will be given great reward and your Employer can be trusted to pay you the reward for your work, but know that the reward of the righteous will be paid in the World to Come.<QL>
@pc<IL12><IR12>@p1<*37>@pcChapter 3<QC>
@p1<IL0><IR0><*38>3:1<LT><EM>Akavya ben Mahalalel says: Consider three things and you will not sin. Know from what you came, where you are going and before Whom you will have to give account and reckoning. From what do you come?from a putrid drop. Where are you going?to a place of dust, decay and maggots. Before Whom are you destined to give account and reckoning?before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.<QL>
@p2<*39>3:2<LT><EM>Rabbi Chanina, the deputy to the Kohen Gadol, says: Pray for the welfare of the government, because if people had no fear of it, they would swallow each other alive. Rabbi Chananyah ben Teradyon says: When two people sit together and words of Torah are not exchanged between them, it is considered a session of scorners, as it is said: And he never sat in the session of scorners [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 1:1]. But when two sit together and discuss words of Torah, the pres ence of God is with them, as it is said: Those who feared God spoke to each other, and God listened and heard, and in His presence a record was written of those who fear God and think about His Name<TIE>.<TIE>.<TIE>. [<IT>Malachi<ITC> 3:16]. This refers to two people. How do we know that even if one person sits and studies the Torah, the Holy One blessed be He, sets aside a reward for him? Because it is said: Though he may sit alone in thoughtful meditation, yet he receives that which was set fo r him [<IT>Lamentations<ITC> 3:27].<QL>
@p2<*40>3:3<LT><EM>Rabbi Shimon says: If three people ate together at a table without speak ing words of Torah, it is as if they had eaten of sacrifices offered to the dead [idols], as it is said: All their tables are full of filth without room [<IT>Isaiah<ITC> 28:8]. But if three ate at a table and spoke words of Torah, it is as though they had eaten from the table of God, as it is said: He said to me this is the table which is in the presence of God [<IT>Ezekiel<ITC> 41:22].<QL>
@p2<*41>3:4<LT><EM>Rabbi Chaninah ben Chachinai says: He who keeps awake at night, or travels alone on the road, and makes room in his heart for idleness, sins against himself.<QL>
@p2<*42>3:5<LT><EM>Rabbi Nechunyah ben Hakanah says: Whoever accepts the yoke of Torah, will be relieved from the yoke of government and the yoke of secular life. But whoever throws aside the yoke of Torah, will be burdened with the yoke of the government and the yoke of secular life.<QL>
@p2<*43>3:6<LT><EM>Rabbi Chalaftah ben Dosa, of the village of Chananyah says: When ten people sit together and study Torah, the presence of God is among them as it is said: God stands in a congregation of the Almighty [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 82:1] How do we know that this applies even to five? Because it is said: He has founded his band upon the earth [<IT>Amos<ITC> 9:6]. How do we know that this applies even to three? Because it is said: He judges in the midst of judges [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 82:1]. How do we know that it applies even to two? Because it is said: Then those who feared God spoke with one another and God listened and heard [<IT>Malachi<ITC> 3:16]. How do we know that it also applies even to one? Because it is said: In every place where I have My Name remembered, I will come to you and bless you [<IT>Exodus<ITC> 20:24].<QL>
@p2<*44>3:7<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar of Bartosa says: Give Him what is His, because you and all that you have are His. This was also expressed by David who said: All things come from You and we have given You only what is Yours [<IT>Chronicles<ITC> 1 29:14]. Rabbi Yaakov says: One who walks on the road while he is studying and interrupts his study to exclaim, How beautiful is this tree! How fine is this field! the Scripture regards him as if he sins against himself.<QL>
@p2<*45>3:8<LT><EM>Rabbi Dostai bar Yannai says in the name of Rabbi Meir: Whoever forgets even one word of his studies, Scriptures regards him as if he had sinned against his soul, for it is said: Only take care and guard your soul diligently that you do not forget the facts which your eyes have seen [<IT>Deuteronomy<ITC> 4:9]. Now, one might suppose that this applies even to a person who has forgotten because his study was too difficult for him. The Torah, therefore, concludes by adding: And lest they be removed from your heart all the days of your life [ibid.]. Accordingly, he is not guilty unless he deliberately removes these teachings from his heart.<QL>
@p2<*46>3:9<LT><EM>Rabbi Chaninah ben Dosa says: Anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom shall endure. But one whose wisdom precedes the fear of sin, his wisdom shall not endure. He used to say: Anyone whose deeds exceed his wisdom, his wisdom will endure, but anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds, his wisdom will not endure.<QL>
@p2<*47>3:10<LT><EM>He used to say: He who is pleasing to his fellow men is pleasing also to God, but he who is not pleasing to men is displeasing to God. Rabbi Dosa ben Horkinos says: Morning sleep and midday wine, childrens talk and sitting in the meeting places of the ignorant, drive a man from the world [i.e., shorten his life].<QL>
@p2<*48>3:11<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar of Modin says: He who profanes sacred things, degrades the festivals, and puts his fellow man to shame in public, violates the covenant of our father, Abraham. And he who interprets the Torah contrary to the Halachaeven though he is learned in Torah and possesses good deedshas no share in the World to Come.<QL>
@p2<*49>3:12<LT><EM>Rabbi Yishmael says: Be yielding to your superior and affable to the young, and receive all man with gladness.<QL>
@p2<*50>3:13<LT><EM>Rabbi Akiva says: Jesting and levity accustom a man to lewdness. Tradi tion (Oral Law) is a protective fence about the Torah, the tithes are a protective fence for wealth, vows are a protective fence for voluntary abstinence. A protective fence for wisdom is silence.<QL>
@p2<*51>3:14<LT><EM>He used to say: Beloved is man, for he was created in the image of God. It was an act of special favor that it was disclosed to him that he was created in Gods image, as it is said: For in the image of God did He create man [<IT>Genesis<ITC> 9:6]. Beloved is Israel for they are called children of God. It was an act of special favor that it was disclosed to them that they are called the children of God, as it is said: You are the children of God [<IT>Deuteronomy<ITC> 14:1]. Beloved is Israel for a precious instrument was given to them which was used to create the world, as it is said: I have given you a good teaching, do not forsake My Torah [<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 4:2].<QL>
@p2<*52>3:15<LT><EM>Everything is foreseen, yet freedom of choice is given. The world is judged with goodness, and the judgment is according to the scope and magni tude of mans actions.<QL>
@p2<*53>3:16<LT><EM>He used to say: Everything is given on pledge and a net is spread out over all the living. The shop is open, the merchant extends credit, the ledger is open and the hand records therein. Whoever wishes to borrow, let him come and borrow. But the collectors make their regular, daily rounds and take payment from man whether or not he realizes it. They have good authority on which to rely and the legal procedure is proper. All is prepared for the festive banquet.<QL>
@p2<*54>3:17<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says: Without Torah there is no proper con duct and without proper conduct there is no Torah. Without wisdom there is no fear of God and without fear of God there is no wisdom. Without knowl edge there is no understanding and without understanding there is no knowl edge. Without sustenance there is no Torah and without Torah there is no sustenance. He used to say: One whose wisdom exceeds his deeds is like a tree that has many branches but few roots. When the wind comes, it uproots it and turns it over as it is said: And he will be like a lonely tree in the wasteland, and shall not see the coming of the good. He will live upon the parched soil in the wilderness, a salt land which is uninhabitable [<IT>Jeremiah<ITC> 17:6]. But he whose deeds exceed his wisdom is like a tree that has few branches and many roots. Even if all the winds in the world come and blow upon it, they cannot move it from its place, as it is said: And he sh all be like a tree planted by the waters which spreads out its roots toward the stream. It shall not see the coming of the heat and its leaf shall remain fresh. It will not be troubled in the year of drought, and will not stop from bearing fruit [<IT>Jeremiah<ITC> 17:8].<QL>
@p2<*55>3:18<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar ben Chisma says: The laws concerning the sacrificing of doves and the commencement of womans unclean period are essential pre cepts. Astronomy and numeric values are condiments to wisdom.<QL>
@pc<IL12><IR12>@p1<*56>@pcChapter 4<QC>
@p1<IL0><IR0><*57>4:1<LT><EM>Ben Zoma says, Who is wise? He who learns from all men, as it is said: From all my teachers I gained wisdom [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 119:99]. Who is mighty? He who conquers his evil inclination, as it is said: He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who controls his will is better than the one who conquers a city [<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 16:32]. Who is rich? He who rejoices with his portion, as it is said: When you enjoy the work of your hands, you will be happy and it will be well with you [<IT>Psalms<ITC> 128:2]. Happy in this world, and it will be well with you in the World to Come. Who is worthy of honor? He who knows his fellowman, as it is said: Those who honor Me, I will honor, and those who despise Me will be held in contempt [<IT>1 Samuel<ITC> 2:30].<QL>
@p2<*58>4:2<LT><EM>Ben Azzai says: Hasten to perform the easiest mitzvah, and run from all sin. For one mitzvah will lead to another mitzvah, and one sin to another sin. Because the reward of a mitzvah is a mitzvah, and the wages of sin is sin.<QL>
@p2<*59>4:3<LT><EM>He used to say: Do not despise any man, and consider nothing impossi ble because there is no man that does not have his hour, and nothing that does not have its place.<QL>
@p2<*60>4:4<LT><EM>Rabbi Levitas of Yavneh says: Be very humble of spirit for the end of man is decay. Rabbi Yochanan the son of Berokah says: He who profanes the Name of God in secret will suffer the penalty for it in public. This is true regardless of whether the act of profanity was done intentionally or unintentionally.<QL>
@p2<*61>4:5<LT><EM>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosse, says: He who learns in order to teach will be given the opportunity to learn and teach. But he who learns in order to perform mitzvos will be given the means to learn, to teach, to observe and to perform the mitzvos. Rabbi Tzadok says: Do not use the knowledge of Torah as a crown to magnify yourself or as a spade to dig. And this is what Hillel used to say: He who makes use of the crown (of Torah) shall pass away. From this you can learn that he who derives personal gain from the words of Torah, takes his own life from this world.<QL>
@p2<*62>4:6<LT><EM>Rabbi Yos? says: He who honors the Torah will himself be honored by mankind, but he who dishonors the Torah will himself be dishonored by mankind.<QL>
@p2<*63>4:7<LT><EM>Rabbi Yishmael, his son, says: He who avoids judicial office rids himself of hatred, robbery and needless oaths, and he who is over confident of his decisions is foolish, wicked and arrogant.<QL>
@p2<*64>4:8<LT><EM>He used to say: Do not judge alone, because there is only One Who judges alone. And do not say: Accept my opinion, for they have the authoritynot you.<QL>
@p2<*65>4:9<LT><EM>Rabbi Yonason says: Whoever fulfills the Torah despite poverty shall eventually fulfill it amidst wealth. He who neglects the Torah amidst wealth shall eventually neglect it in poverty.<QL>
@p2<*66>4:10<LT><EM>Rabbi Meir says: Limit your business activities and be occupied with the Torah instead. Be of humble spirit in the presence of all men. If you neglect the Torah, many causes for further neglect will come your way, but if you toil in the Torah, God has abundant reward to give you.<QL>
@p2<*67>4:11<LT><EM>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: He who performs one mitzvah gains one advocate for himself and he who commits one sin acquires one accuser. Repen tance and good deeds are a shield against calamity. Rabbi Yochanan HaSandler says: Every assembly that is called in the name of Heaven will endure, but that which is not for the sake of Heaven, will not endure.<QL>
@p2<*68>4:12<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua says: Let the honor of your student be as dear to you as your own. Let the honor of your colleague be as dear to you as the reverence due to your teacher. And let the reverence due to your teacher be as dear to you as the reverence due to God.<QL>
@p2<*69>4:13<LT><EM>Rabbi Yehudah says: Be careful in teaching, for an error in teaching may amount to an intentional sin. Rabbi Shimon says: There are three crowns: The crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty. But the crown of a good name exceeds them all.<QL>
@p2<*70>4:14<LT><EM>Rabbi Nehorai says: Move to a place where Torah is studied and do not say that the Torah will follow you, because your fellow students will make it your possession. And do not rely on your own understanding.<QL>
@p2<*71>4:15<LT><EM>Rabbi Yannai says: We cannot account for the tranquility of the wicked or the afflictions of the righteous. Rabbi Masyah ben Charash says: Be first to greet all men and be a tail among lions rather than a head among foxes.<QL>
@p2<*72>4:16<LT><EM>Rabbi Yaakov says: This world is like a lobby before the World to Come. Prepare yourself in the lobby so that you may enter the banquet hall.<QL>
@p2<*73>4:17<LT><EM>He used to say: One hour spent in repentance and good deeds in this world is worth more than the whole life of the World to Come. And one hour of the spiritual bliss in the World to Come is worth more than the whole life of this world.<QL>
@p2<*74>4:18<LT><EM>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Do not try to pacify your friend at the time of his anger and do not comfort him while his dead lies before him. At the time he makes a vow, do not suggest ways for him to reconsider his vow, and try not to see him at the time of his humiliation.<QL>
@p2<*75>4:19<LT><EM>Shmuel HaKattan says: Do not rejoice when your enemy falls and do not be glad in your heart when he stumbles lest God see it and be displeased and will divert His anger from him.<QL>
@p2<*76>4:20<LT><EM>Elisha ben Abuyah says: That which one learns in his youth to what is it compared? To ink written on new paper. That which one learns in his old age to what is it compared? To ink written on blotted paper. Rabbi Yos? ben Yehudah of Kfar HaBavli says: He who learns from young men is like one who eats unripe grapes and drinks the (new) wine from the wine press. He who learns from old men is like one who eats ripe grapes and drinks aged wine. Rabbi Meir says: Do not look at the bottle but at what it contains. A new bottle may be full of old wine and an old bottle may not even have new wine.<QL>
@p2<*77>4:21<LT><EM>Rabbi Elazar HaKapar says: Envy, lust and desire for honor drive a man out of the world.<QL>
@p2<*78>4:22<LT><EM>He used to say: Those who are born are destined to die and the dead to rise again; the living to be judged, to know, to teach and to make known that God is the Maker, He is the Creator. He understands everything, He is the Judge, He is the witness, He is the complainant. He will judge in the time to come, blessed be He, in Whose presence there is no wrong, no forgetfulness, no partiality, nor acceptance of bribes. Know that everything is according to reckoning, and do not let your passions give you hope that the grave is a place of refuge for you. Because against your will, you were formed; against your will you live; against your will you will die; and against your will you must, in the future, give account and reckoning before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He.<QL>

@p1<IL0><IR0><*80>5:1<LT><EM>By ten utterances was the world created. And what does this teach us? Surely the world could have been created by one utterance.

Pestilence comes upon the world to execute those death penalties mentioned in the Torah which are not within the jurisdiction of the Beth Din, and for making forbidden use of the harvest of the Sabbatical year.

An evil eye [a grudging nature], a haughty spirit, and a demanding soul [excessive desire] are the characteristics of the disciples of the wicked Biliam. What is the difference between the disciples of our father Abraham and the disciples of the wicked Biliam? The disciples of our father Abraham enjoy this world and inherit the World to Come, as it says: That I may cause those who love Me to inherit substance (wealth), and I will fill their treasuries (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 8:21). The disciples of the wicked Biliam inherit Gehennom and descend into the pit of destruction, as it is said: You, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction; men of murder and deceit will not live out half their days, but I trust in You (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 55:24).<QL>

@p1<*105>6:1<LT><EM>Rabbi Meir says: He who occupies himself with the Torah for its own sake acquires many things and he alone is sufficient for the existence of the entire world. He (who is so occupied) is called beloved friend; he loves God, he loves mankind; he is a joy to God and a joy to mankind. The Torah clothes him with humility and reverence; it enables him to be righteous, saintly, upright and trustworthy. It keeps him from sin and draws him to virtue. Men gain, through him, the benefits of counsel, sound wisdom, understanding and strength, for it is said: Counsel and sound wisdom are mine (the Torahs), I (the Torah) am understanding, might is mine (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 8:14). The Torah bestows upon him royalty and dominion (he will be accepted and trusted as a leader) and a discerning judge (his decisions will be sought after and accepted). The secrets of the Torah are revealed to him and he becomes like an everflowing spring, and like a river that constantly grows in vigor. He becomes modest, patient and forgiving (of insults) and it (the Torah) makes him great and raises him above all creatures.<QL>
@p2<*106>6:2<LT><EM>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Every day a heavenly voice goes forth from Mount Horeb, proclaiming these words: Woe to them, to mankind for their disregard of the Torah for whoever does not occupy himself with the Torah is considered rebuked, as it is said: As a golden ring in a swines snout, so is a beautiful woman that turns aside from discretion (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 11:22). And it is said: The Tablets are the work of God and the writing is the writing of God engraved (Charuth) upon the Tablets (<IT>Exodus<ITC> 32:16). Do not read charuth (engraved) but cheruth (freedom), for man is never more free than when he occupies himself with the study of Torah. Anyone who occupies himself with the study of the Torah will be exalted for it is said: From Mattanah (the gift of God, i.e. Torah) one attains Nachaliel (the heritage of God), and from Nachaliel one is raised to Bamoth (high places) (<IT>Numbers<ITC> 21:19).<QL>
@p2<*107>6:3<LT><EM>He who learns from his companion, even one chapter, one rule, one verse, one word, or even one letter, is obliged to treat him with respect. For so we find concerning David, King of Israel, who learned only two things from Achitophel and yet he called him his master, his guide, and his intimate friend, as it is said: You are my master, my guide and intimate friend (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 55:14). Now, we may infer as follows: If David, King of Israel, who learned only two things from Achitofel, addressed him as master, guide and intimate friend, how much more ought one who learns from his companion one chapter, one rule, one verse, one word or even one letter, treat him with honor. Honor is implicit only in reference to the Torah, as it is said: The wise shall inherit honor (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 3:35), and men of integrity shall inherit that which is good (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 28:10). That which is good, implies Torah, as it is said: I have given you good instruction, forsake not my Torah (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 4:2).<QL>
@p2<*108>6:4<LT><EM>This is the pathway of Torah: eat bread with salt, drink water by measure, sleep upon the bare earth, live a life of hardship and toil in the study of Torah.

@p2<*109>6:5<LT><EM>Do not seek greatness for yourself and do not crave honor. Let your deeds (mitzvos) exceed your learning and do not aspire after the table of kings.

@p2<*110>6:6<LT><EM>The (crown of) Torah is more glorious than (the crowns of) Priesthood and royalty. For while royalty is acquired by thirty qualifications and the Priesthood by twenty four, the Torah must be acquired by fortyeight qualifi cations, namely: study, attentive listening, orderly speech, understanding, intuitive insight, awe, reverence, humility, joy, purity, attendance on scholars, debate with colleagues, discussion with students, deliberation, knowledge of the Scriptures and of the Mishnah, moderation in business affairs, moderation in worldly affairs, moderation in pleasure, moderation in sleep, moderation in conversation, moderation in frivolity, patience, good naturedness, trust in the Sages, uncomplaining acceptance of suffering. (Torah is acquired also by him), who: knows his place; is content with his lot in life; limits his words; does not claim credit for his achievements; is beloved; loves God; loves mankind; loves acts of charity and kindness; loves straightforwardness; loves admonition; shuns honor; is not conceited with his learning; does not delight in dictating decisions; shares the burden of his fellowman; and judges him favorably; directs him to the truth; and to peace; is composed in his learning; asks pertinent questions and answers to the point; listens and adds to his learning; studies in order to teach; studies in order to practice; increases the wisdom of his teacher; notes accurately what he has learned; quotes a thing in the name of the person who said it. You should know that whoever reports a thing in the name of the person who said it brings deliverance to the world; for it is said: And Esther told the king in the name of Mordechai (<IT>Megilas Esther<ITC> 2:22).<QL>
@p2<*111>6:7<LT><EM>Great is the Torah, for it gives life to those who fulfill it, in this world and in the World to Come, as it is said: For they are life to those who find them and health to all flesh (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 4:22). And it also says: It will be health to your body and marrow to your bones (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 3:8). It is said: It is a tree of life to those who take hold of it and fortunate are those who support it (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 3:18). And it is said: They shall be a graceful garland about your head and necklaces around your neck (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 1:9). And it is said: It shall place a graceful garland on your head, and bestow a crown of glory on you (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 4:9). And it is said: Through me your days will be multiplied, the years of your life will be increased (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 9:11). And it is said: Length of days are in its right hand: wealth and honor are in its left hand (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 3:16).

@p2<*112>6:8<LT><EM>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah (some texts read, ben Menasya) says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai: Beauty, strength, riches, honor, wisdom, old age, fullness of years, and children are becoming to the righteous and becoming to the world, as it is said: Fullness of years is a crown of glory which is found in the way of righteousness (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 16:31). And it is said: Grand children are the crown of the old and the glory of children are their fathers (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 17:6). And it says: The glory of young men is their strength, and the adornment of old men is fullness of years (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 20:29). And it says: The moon will grow pale and the sun ashamed, for God has begun His reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and there will be glory for the elders of his people (<IT>Isaiah<ITC> 24:25).

@p2<*113>6:9<LT><EM>Rabbi Yos? ben Kisma said: One time as I was walking on the road a man met me and greeted me and I returned his greeting. He said to me: From where do you come? I replied: I come from a great city of sages and schol ars. He then said to me: Rabbi, if you would be willing to live with us in our vicinity, I would give you a million golden dinars and precious stones and pearls. I replied: Were you to give me all the silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls in the world, I would not live anywhere except in a place of Torah. For similarly it is written in the Book of Psalms, by David, King of Israel: Thy Torah means more to me than thousands in gold and silver (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 119:72). Furthermore, when a man dies, neither silver nor gold nor precious stones nor pearls accompany him. His only accompaniment will be the Torah he studied and the good deeds he performed, as it is said: As you walk, it will guide you; when you lie down, it will watch over you; when you awaken; it will speak to you (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 6:22). As you walk, it will guide youin this world; when you lie down, it will watch over youin the grave; when you awaken, it will speak to youin the World to Come.

@p2<*114>6:10<LT><EM>Five possessions has the Holy One, blessed be He, declared His own in His world: Torah, Heaven and Earth, Abraham, Israel, and the Holy Temple. How do we know that the Torah is considered Gods possession? Because it is written: God created me as His first possession, first of all His works from of old (<IT>Proverbs<ITC> 8:22). How do we know that heaven and earth are considered His possession? Because it is written, Thus says God: the heaven is my throne, the earth is My footstool; what manner of house will you build for Me, and what manner of place for My rest (<IT>Isaiah<ITC> 66:1). And it is also said: How numerous and varied are Your works, O God, you have made them all with wisdom: the earth is filled with Your possessions (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 104:24). How do we know that Abraham is considered His possession? Because it is written: And he (Malki zedek) blessed him and said: Blessed be Avrom to the most high God, the Possessor of heaven a nd earth (<IT>Genesis<ITC> 14:19). How do we know that Israel is considered His possession? Because it is written: Until your people pass over, O God, until the people you have acquired pass over (<IT>Exodus<ITC> 15:16). And it is also written: The holy ones that are on earth, they are excellent by virtue of My will that is achieved through them (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 16:3). How do we know that the Holy Temple is considered His possession? Because it is written: The dwelling place which You, O God have prepared; the Holy place of God, which Your hands have established (<IT>Exodus<ITC> 15:17).
