@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*5>5@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Why did our Sages institute three different forms for the Sabbath Shemoneh Esrei: in Maariv @hh<HEB>àÇúÌÈä ÷ÄãÇùÑÀúÌÈ@eeENG, in Shacharis @hh<HEB>éÄùÒÀîÇç îùÆä@eeENG, and in Mincha @hh<HEB>àÇúÌä àÆçÈã@eeENG, whereas on Festivals all three services have the identical Shemoneh Esrei? Our Sages ordained these three separate forms to signify three kinds of Sabbaththe Sabbath of creation, the Sabbath on which the Torah was given at Sinai, and the Sabbath of the World to Come. Thus at Maariv, we say @hh<HEB>àÇúÌÈä ÷ÄãÇùÑÀúÌÈ@eeENG, You have sanctified the Seventh daythe climax of making heaven and earth commemorating the Sabbath of creation. At Shacharis, we say, @hh<HEB>éÄùÒÀîÇç îùÆä@eeENG Moses will rejoice in the gift .<TIE>.<TIE>. when he stood before You on Mount Sinaito commemorate the giving of the Torah. And at Mincha we say, @hh<HEB>àÇúÌÈä àÆçÈã@eeENG, You are One, to remind us of the Sabbath of the WorldtoCome where indeed it will be revealed to all that He is One.<IT>Siach Yitzchok<ITC><QL>

@hs@b1@le@n2<BO><SZ9><LD11.5><JF><EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*11>11@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>In <IT>Leviticus<ITC> 9:22, we find that after he completed the Divine offering, Aaron lifted up his hands and blessed the people. In like manner, his descendants, the <IT>kohanim,<ITC> uttered the priestly blessing after performing the Temple Service. In our days on the occasions when the <IT>kohanim<ITC> recite the priestly blessings, they do so immediately after the We are thankful prayer which terminates the <IT>Avodah<ITC> (Service) section of the <IT>Shemoneh Esrei.<ITC> When <IT>kohanim<ITC> do not say the blessings, the blessings are mentioned by the <IT>Chazzan<ITC> in his repetition of the <IT>Shemoneh Esrei.<ITC><IT>Avudraham<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*12>12@b2<EN><IT><SZ9><SUP0>Rashi<ITC> paraphrases this blessing with the words @hh<HEB>éÄëÀáùÑ ëÌÇrÂñå@eeENG, May He withhold His anger from you.
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*13>13@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Since the <IT>Birkas Kohanim<ITC> conclude with a blessing for peace, this concluding blessing is a restatement of the last benediction in the form of a congregational prayer.<IT>Pesher Dovor<ITC>
@b1@le<BO><SZ9><LD11.5><JF><EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*14>14@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>One of the most important <IT>mitzvos<ITC> of the Torah of Life is the mitzvah of doing kindness. But it is incomplete unless there is a love of kindliness in the heart which precedes the act of kindliness.<IT>Pesher Dovor<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*15>15@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>This prayer was the personal meditation of Mar the son of Ravina, which he recited after he completed his prayers (<IT>Maseches Berachos<ITC> 17a), and it is therefore expressed in the singular. The Jew prays that his mouth, his tongue, and his lips, which have just served as the instruments for his communion with God, will not forfeit any of their moral purity in his dealings with his fellow men.<IT>Yaavetz<ITC>
@sn<EM><EN>This prayer is based on the verse, Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech (<IT>Psalms<ITC> 34:14). Even though good and evil depend on mans will, he nevertheless prays for Gods help in controlling himself, so as to permit no insult to provoke his wrath, and to remain calm and silent even in the face of a curse.<IT>Avudraham<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*16>16@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>May I have an open, receptive and understanding mind and spirit in the study of Torah.

Let me demonstrate zealous and vigorous endeavor in all things pertaining to Your <IT>mitzvos.<ITC><IT>Etz Yosef; S.R. Hirsch<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*17>17@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>According to <IT>Kitzur Shelah,<ITC> it is of special merit to recite a Scriptural verse signifying your name before you conclude the <IT>Shemoneh Esrei.<ITC> This verse (or verses) should be recited before you say @hh<HEB>éÄäÀéåÌ ìÀøÈöåÉï@eeENG.
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*18>18@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The Sabbath, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to God. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve God and to praise Him.<IT>Radak<ITC>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*19>19@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.<IT>Rashi<ITC>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*26>26@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>ùÑÄáÀúÌÄé@eeENG is my sitting. The Talmud states that no man may sit in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of David.<IT>Maseches Soteh<ITC> 40b<QL>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*29>29@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. Hear my voice, refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*30>30@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, God would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.<IT>S.R. Hirsch<ITC><QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*31>31@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>His enemies. David asks for Divine help that he be saved even from the mere semblance of wrongdoing so that his foes should not be able to rejoice over his faults.<IT>S.R. Hirsch<ITC><QL>
