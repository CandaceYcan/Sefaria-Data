@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*4>4@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The literal meaning of @hh<HEB> ùÑÈìÈì@eeENG is booty which implies an unexpected gain to which one had no prior claim.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*5>5@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>A person can do much good to another and still cause him moments of pain or shame by his conduct.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*8>8@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>This verse is connected with what follows. No time is wasted in idleness. Her other work being finished, she spends her leisure in spinning and making garments for the poor and for the members of her household.<QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*9>9@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>An @hh<HEB> àÆáéåÉï@eeENG, a needy person, is in more desperate need than an @hh<HEB>rÈğÄé @eeENG, a poor person. The <IT>woman of valor<ITC> recognizes that. To the poor man, therefore, she opens her palms, permitting him to take what he wishes. But regarding the needy man, she takes the initiative by extending her hands to provide his needs.<IT>Metsudas Dovid<ITC><QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*10>10@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>She was attired in the costliest garments, as befits a distinguished woman.<QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*11>11@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>Oriental cities had deep gateways shaded from the sun. There the elders sat as a court to adjudicate disputes and discuss important communal affairs.<QL>

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*13>13@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>These characteristics are borne by her as one wears clothes. See <IT>Psalms<ITC> 104:1, With beauty and splendor are You clothed.<QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*14>14@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>God shows the righteous, just before their death, the share they have earned in the World to Come.

Because these two words are part of a verse, the Sages incorporated the preceding words, @hh<HEB>åÇéÀäÄé rÆøÆá åÇéÀäÄé á÷Æø@eeENG and there was morning and there was evening, to form a complete sentence. These words however, are said quietly as they do not relate to the <IT>Kiddush.<ITC><QL>
@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*20>20@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>God completed His work at the precise moment which marked the beginning of the seventh day, but nevertheless was not part of it.

@b1<EM><EN><SZ6><SUP2.5><*48>48@b2<EN><SZ9><SUP0>The third stanza parallels the third blessing of Birchas Hamazon (See page 000.)
