<title>Acknowledgments</title>
<p>The guidance provided by Rabbi Abraham Lipshitz has greatly improved the quality of this translation. Much of the library work necessary to supply references for ibn Ezra&#x2019;s allusions was carried out at Chesed L&#x2019;Avrohom Nachlas David, where the books are nearly always properly shelved; a few of the rarer volumes were found at the Asher Library of the Spertus Institute. The English translation of Pentateuchal passages was influenced by Rabbi Charles Kahane&#x2019;s <italic>Torah Yesharah</italic>. The <italic>Me&#x1E25;oqeqey Yhuda</italic> of the late Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky served as primary commentary on the text, supplemented by the commentary of the late Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Netter. For a short period of time I had access to Abraham Lipshitz&#x2019;s copy of the Weiser commentary, which was greatly useful.</p>
<p>My greatest debt, however, is to Abraham ibn Ezra himself, and to his teachers and their teachers before them, who preserved and clarified traditions dating back to Moses, and gave them over to the keeping of future generations.</p>

<title>A Point of Law</title>
<p>Jewish law forbids one to accept payment for teaching Torah. Yet this book is not being given away &#x2014; it is being sold. One must not conclude from the behavior of the publisher, however, that an individual is permitted to draw a salary for teaching. Several factors combine which possibly render the sale of this book permissible:</p>
<p align="blockquote">1) The cost of printing books is not directly proportional to the number of books printed. Publishing entails both fixed costs and variable costs. Certain initial expenses &#x2014; e.g., setting up the plates &#x2014; must occur no matter how many copies are made. Other expenses &#x2014; e.g., buying paper &#x2014; depend on the size of the printing. Thus, unless you can predict exactly how many copies you will sell, it is impossible to establish a selling price that guarantees neither a profit nor a loss. Consequently, a sufficiently popular book will necessarily make money, while a sufficiently unpopular book will necessarily lose money, and there is no way to avoid both possibilities simultaneously.</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) The prohibition against teaching Torah professionally extends only to the oral Torah (<italic>tora sheb&#x2018;al peh</italic>). One is permitted to collect a fee for teaching the written Torah (<italic>tora shebikhtav</italic>). Although this book contains <italic>tora sheb&#x2018;al peh</italic>, it also contains <italic>tora shebikhtav;</italic> the portions of the book which may be sold are inseparable from the portions of the book which may not be sold.</p>
<p align="blockquote">3) The author of the book has been dead for several centuries and will collect no earthly royalties from it. The only people collecting royalties will be the publisher and the translator. Translating someone else&#x2019;s teachings is not the same thing as teaching something yourself, therefore it may be forbidden to do the latter, but not the former, for money. (This reason is probably the weakest of the four. Every translation is perforce an interpretation. Ibn Ezra himself often called the early Sages the <italic>ma&#x2018;atiqim</italic>.)</p>
<p align="blockquote">4) A book is a physical commodity. Conceivably, giving a lecture falls under the definition of &#x201C;teaching&#x201D;, but selling a commodity does not fall under that definition.</p>
<p>The absence of any of these four factors would have rendered the sale of this book of questionable legality. In fact, the legality of the sale ought still to be considered questionable. I do not hereby supply a <italic>psaq din</italic>, and no one should derive a <italic>hetter</italic> for similar behavior either from my actions or from their defense.</p>
<p>It should go without saying &#x2014; but perhaps it must be said &#x2014; that these words must not serve as a pretext for criticizing the well-intentioned actions of any other human being. Observing <italic>Hilkhot Talmud Tora</italic>, 1:7, does not allow one to disregard <italic>Hilkhot De&#x2018;ot</italic>, 2:3. Whoever uses the above point of law to justify feelings of disrespect or disdain commits a crime far more serious than any which I have here tried to prevent.</p>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn1">[1:1]</xref></sup>GOD called to Moshe and spoke to him from within the Tent of Assembly, saying: <sup><xref rid="fn2">[2]</xref></sup>Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: &#x201C;Any man who brings, from among you, a sacrifice to GOD &#x2014; you will bring your offering from domestic stock: from cattle, or from the flock. <sup><xref rid="fn3">[3]</xref></sup>If he brings a burnt-offering from the cattle, he will bring an unblemished male to the entrance of the Tent of Assembly. He will bring it willingly before GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn4">[4]</xref></sup>He will place his hand on the burnt offering&#x2019;s head, and it will be accepted, to atone for him. <sup><xref rid="fn5">[5]</xref></sup>He will slaughter the ox before GOD, and the sons of Aaron, the kohanim, will bring the blood, and will throw the blood around the sides of the altar at the entrance of the Tent of Assembly. <sup><xref rid="fn6">[6]</xref></sup>He will skin the burnt-offering and carve it into its limbs. <sup><xref rid="fn7">[7]</xref></sup>The sons of Aaron the kohen will light a fire on the altar, and arrange wood on the fire. <sup><xref rid="fn8">[8]</xref></sup>The sons of Aaron, the kohanim, will arrange the limbs, the head, and the fats upon the wood of the fire on the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn9">[9]</xref></sup>He will wash its innards and its legs with water, and the kohen will kindle all on the altar for a burnt-offering, consumed by fire, that is willingly accepted by GOD.</p>
<p><sup>[10]</sup>If his burnt-offering is from the flock, whether of sheep or of goats, he will offer an unblemished male. <sup><xref rid="fn10">[11]</xref></sup>He will slaughter it at the northern side of the altar, before GOD, and the sons of Aaron, the kohanim, will throw its blood around the sides of the altar. <sup>[12]</sup>He will carve it into its limbs, which the kohen will arrange with its head and fats on the wood of the fire on the altar. <sup>[13]</sup>He will wash the innards and the legs with water, and the kohen will bring and kindle all on the altar; it is a burnt-offering consumed by fire that is willingly accepted by GOD.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn11">[14]</xref></sup>If his burnt-offering to GOD is of fowl, he will bring his offering from turtledoves, or from the young of pigeons. <sup><xref rid="fn12">[15]</xref></sup>The kohen will bring it to the altar, and behead it, and kindle it on the altar. Its blood will be squeezed out against the wall of the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn13">[16]</xref></sup>He will remove its crop with its outer feathers, and cast it beside the altar, to the east, toward the ash-heap. <sup><xref rid="fn14">[17]</xref></sup>He will split it by its wings, but will not divide it completely; the kohen will kindle it on the altar, on the wood of the fire. It is a burnt-offering consumed by fire, willingly accepted by GOD.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn15">[2:1]</xref></sup>If someone should offer a cereal-offering to GOD, his offering will be of fine flour; he will pour oil over it, and put frankincense upon it. <sup><xref rid="fn16">[2]</xref></sup>He will bring it to Aaron&#x2019;s sons, the kohanim. He shall scoop out a fistful from its fine flour and oil, besides all its frankincense; the kohen will kindle its memorial-part on the altar: an offering consumed by fire, willingly accepted by GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn17">[3]</xref></sup>What remains of the cereal-offering will be for Aaron and his sons, most holy among the fire-offerings to GOD.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn18">[4]</xref></sup>If you bring a cereal-offering baked in the oven, bring either ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;a loaves of fine flour mixed with oil, or ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;a wafers smeared with oil.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn19">[5]</xref></sup>If your cereal-offering is fried in a pan, it will be ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;a of fine flour mixed with oil. <sup>[6]</sup>Crumble it into pieces and pour oil on it: it is a cereal-offering.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn20">[7]</xref></sup>If your offering is a braised cereal-offering, it will be made of fine flour with oil. <sup>[8]</sup>You will bring the cereal-offering made of these ingredients to GOD and present it to the kohen; he will bring it to the altar. <sup>[9]</sup>The kohen will lift out the memorial-part from the cereal-offering, and kindle it on the altar as an offering consumed by fire, willingly accepted by GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn21">[10]</xref></sup>What is left of the cereal-offering after the fire-offering will be most holy for Aaron and his sons. <sup><xref rid="fn22">[11]</xref></sup>Any cereal-offering you bring to GOD will not be leavened, for you must kindle no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering to be consumed by fire for GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn23">[12]</xref></sup>You may bring them to GOD as offerings of first-fruit, but they will not be willingly accepted to be burnt on the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn24">[13]</xref></sup>You must season all your cereal-offerings with salt. You must not withhold the salt of your God&#x2019;s covenant from your cereal-offerings. You must bring salt with all your offerings.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn25">[14]</xref></sup>If you bring a first-fruit offering to GOD, bring ripe ears dried in fire, ground-grain and fresh-grain as the cereal-offering of your first-fruits. <sup>[15]</sup>Put oil on it, and place frankincense on it, for it is a cereal-offering. <sup>[16]</sup>The kohen will kindle its memorial-part, some ground-grain and some oil with all the frankincense, as an offering consumed by fire for GOD.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn26">[3:1]</xref></sup>If his offering is a peace-offering: If he offers it from cattle, he may offer an unblemished male or female before GOD. <sup>[2]</sup>He will place his hand on the head of his offering, and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Assembly; Aaron&#x2019;s descendants, the kohanim, will throw the blood around the sides of the altar. <sup>[3]</sup>From the peace-offering he must bring a fire-offering to GOD: the fat that covers the stomach, all the fat that is on the stomach, <sup><xref rid="fn27">[4]</xref></sup>the two kidneys, and the fat on them &#x2014; which is near the loins &#x2014; and he will remove the lobe on top of the liver, with the kidneys. <sup>[5]</sup>Aaron&#x2019;s descendants will kindle it on the altar after the burnt-offering, on the wood of the fire: an offering consumed by fire, willingly accepted by GOD.</p>
<p><sup>[6]</sup>If his peace-offering to GOD is of the flock he will offer an unblemished male or female. <sup>[7]</sup>If he brings a lamb for his offering, he will bring it before GOD. <sup>[8]</sup>He will place his hand on the head of his offerings, and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Assembly; and Aaron&#x2019;s sons will throw its blood around the sides of the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn28">[9]</xref></sup>From the peace-offering he will make a fire-offering to GOD. He will remove its suet [for want of a better term, the word &#x201C;suet&#x201D; will be used to denote organic, as opposed to subcutaneous, fat &#x2014; Translator]: the entire fat-tail, adjoining the spinal column; the fat that covers the stomach; all the fat on the stomach; <sup>[10]</sup>the two kidneys, and the fat on them &#x2014; which is near the loins; and he will remove the lobe on top of the liver, with the kidneys. <sup><xref rid="fn29">[11]</xref></sup>The kohen will kindle it on the altar as food for the fire dedicated to GOD.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn30">[12]</xref></sup>If his offering is a goat, he will bring it before GOD. <sup>[13]</sup>He will place his hand on its head, and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Assembly. Aaron&#x2019;s sons will throw its blood around the sides of the altar. <sup>[14]</sup>He will offer from it his fire-sacrifice to GOD: the fat that covers the stomach; all the fat on the stomach; <sup>[15]</sup>the two kidneys, and the fat on them &#x2014; which is near the loins; and he will remove the lobe on top of the liver, with the kidneys. <sup><xref rid="fn31">[16]</xref></sup>The kohen will kindle them on the altar as food for the fire, willingly accepted. All of this fat will be offered to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn32">[17]</xref></sup>It is an everlasting decree for your generations in all your dwelling places: Eat no suet or blood.&#x201D;</p>
<p><sup>[4:1]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn33">[2]</xref></sup>Tell the Children of Israel: &#x201C;If anyone sins unintentionally against any of GOD&#x2019;s commandments, doing one of the things that should not be done: <sup><xref rid="fn34">[3]</xref></sup>If the Annointed Kohen commits a sin that brings the people to guilt, he must offer an unblemished bullock of the herd to GOD as a sin-offering to atone on his sin which he committed. <sup>[4]</sup>He will bring the bullock to the entrance of the Tent of Assembly before GOD. He will place his hand on the head of the bullock, and slaughter it before GOD. <sup>[5]</sup>The Annointed Kohen will take some of the bullock&#x2019;s blood and bring it into the Tent of Assembly. <sup><xref rid="fn35">[6]</xref></sup>The kohen will dip his finger in the blood, and will sprinkle of the blood seven times before GOD in front of the holy Partition. <sup><xref rid="fn36">[7]</xref></sup>The kohen will put some of the blood on the corners of the altar of fragrant incense, before GOD, in the Tent of Assembly. He will pour all of the bullock&#x2019;s blood at the base of the altar for burnt-offerings, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Assembly. <sup><xref rid="fn37">[8]</xref></sup>He will remove all the fat of the bullock sin-offering from it: the fat that covers the stomach; all the fat on the stomach; <sup>[9]</sup>the two kidneys, and the fat on them &#x2014; which is near the loins; and he will remove the lobe on top of the liver, with the kidneys, <sup>[10]</sup>as was removed from the bull of the peace-offering. The kohen will kindle them on the altar for burnt-offerings. <sup><xref rid="fn38">[11]</xref></sup>But the skin of the bullock, all the flesh, including its head, its legs, its innards, and its dung &#x2014; <sup><xref rid="fn39">[12]</xref></sup>he will take all of the bullock out of the camp to a ritually pure place where the ashes are poured out. He will burn it on wood with fire; it will be burned on the place where the ashes are to be poured.</p>
<p><sup>[13]</sup>If the entire Assembly of Israel will err, and the public will be unaware of the error, and will do one of those things that GOD has commanded not to do, thereby incurring guilt: <sup><xref rid="fn40">[14]</xref></sup>When the sin, regarding which they have sinned, will be disclosed, the public will offer a bullock of the herd as a sin-offering and will bring it before the Tent of Assembly. <sup><xref rid="fn41">[15]</xref></sup>The elders of the assembly will place their hands on the bullock&#x2019;s head before GOD, and he will slaughter the bullock before GOD. <sup>[16]</sup>The Annointed Kohen will bring some of the blood into the Tent of Assembly. <sup>[17]</sup>The kohen will dip his finger in the blood, and will sprinkle seven times before GOD in front of the Partition.</p>
<p><sup>[18]</sup>He will put some of the blood on the corners of the altar that is before GOD inside the Tent of Assembly. He will pour out all the blood at the base of the altar for burnt-offerings, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Assembly. <sup>[19]</sup>He will remove all its suet from it, and kindle it on the altar. <sup>[20]</sup>He will do with the bullock exactly as he did with the bullock of the sin-offering; the kohen will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven. <sup><xref rid="fn42">[21]</xref></sup>He will take the bullock outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the aforementioned bullock; it is the public&#x2019;s sin-offering.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn43">[22]</xref></sup>If a chief sins unintentionally by doing any one of the things which GOD, his God, commanded not to be done, thereby incurring guilt: <sup><xref rid="fn44">[23]</xref></sup>When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he will bring an unblemished male goat as his offering. <sup>[24]</sup>He will place his hand on the goat&#x2019;s head, and he will slaughter it at the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered, before GOD; it is a sin-offering. <sup>[25]</sup>The kohen will take some of the sin-offering&#x2019;s blood with his finger, and smear it on the corners of the altar for burnt-offerings. He will pour its blood at the base of the altar for burnt-offerings. <sup>[26]</sup>He will kindle all its suet on the altar, as with the suet of the peace-offering. The kohen will secure atonement for his sin, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn45">[27]</xref></sup>If any ordinary person sins unintentionally by doing one of the things that GOD commanded not to be done, and thereby committed an offense: <sup><xref rid="fn46">[28]</xref></sup>When he becomes aware of the sin he has committed, he will bring an unblemished female goat as his offering for the sin he committed. <sup>[29]</sup>He will place his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and will slaughter the sin-offering at the burnt-offering place. <sup>[30]</sup>The kohen will take some of its blood on his finger, and smear it on the corners of the altar for burnt-offerings. He will pour all its blood at the base of the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn47">[31]</xref></sup>He will remove all its suet, as the suet was removed from the peace-offering, and the kohen will kindle it on the altar as an offering willingly accepted by GOD. The kohen will secure atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn48">[32]</xref></sup>If he bring a sheep as his offering for a sin-offering, he will bring an unblemished female. <sup>[33]</sup>He will place his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and he will slaughter it as a sin-offering at the place where the burnt-offering is slaughtered. <sup>[34]</sup>The kohen will take some of the sin-offering&#x2019;s blood with his finger and smear it on the corners of the altar for burnt-offerings. He will pour all its blood at the base of the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn49">[35]</xref></sup>He will remove all its suet, as the suet of the lamb peace-offering was removed, and the kohen will kindle it on the altar with GOD&#x2019;s offerings that are consumed by fire. The kohen will secure atonement for the sin he committed, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn50">[5:1]</xref></sup>Anyone who sins, having heard admission of guilt, if he was a witness (whether he saw, or he knew), and if he does not tell, he has committed an offense; <sup><xref rid="fn51">[2]</xref></sup>or anyone who touches any ritually impure thing, either the carcass of a ritually impure wild animal, or the carcass of a ritually impure domesticated beast, or the carcass of a ritually impure creeping being, and is unaware of it, and commits an offense while ritually impure; <sup><xref rid="fn52">[3]</xref></sup>or if he touches a human ritual impurity, or any impurity &#x2014; whatever has caused him to become ritually impure &#x2014; and he is unaware of it, and then discovers that he has committed an offense; <sup><xref rid="fn53">[4]</xref></sup>or if anyone swears, pronouncing with his lips, to do harm, or to do good, concerning anything regarding which one may utter an oath, and he then forgets, and then becomes aware that he has committed an offense: In any of these cases, <sup><xref rid="fn54">[5]</xref></sup>when he becomes guilty, in any of these cases, he will confess his sin, <sup>[6]</sup>and he will bring his guilt-offering to GOD for the sin he committed: a female from the flock, either a lamb or a goat, as a sin-offering. The kohen will make atonement for his sin. <sup><xref rid="fn55">[7]</xref></sup>If he cannot afford a lamb, he will bring as his guilt-offering for his sin two turtle-doves or two young pigeons to GOD: one as a sin-offering and the other as a burnt-offering. <sup>[8]</sup>He will bring them to the kohen, who will offer the one brought as a sin-offering first. He will cut off its head at the back of the neck, but he will not divide it. <sup>[9]</sup>He will squirt some of the blood of the sin-offering on the wall of the altar, and the remaining blood will be squeezed out at the base of the altar; it is a sin-offering. <sup>[10]</sup>He will make the second a standard burnt-offering. The kohen will secure atonement for him for the sin he committed, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn56">[11]</xref></sup>If he cannot afford two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, the offering he brings for the sin committed shall be one-tenth of an <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic> of fine flour, for a sin-offering. He will put no oil in it, nor will he put any frankincense on it, for it is a sin-offering. <sup>[12]</sup>He will bring it to the kohen. The kohen will scoop out a fistful as its memorial-part, and burn it on the altar, upon the fire-offerings of GOD. It is a sin-offering. <sup>[13]</sup>The kohen will secure atonement for him for the sin he committed in any of the above cases, and he will be forgiven. It belongs to the kohen, like any cereal-offering.&#x201D;</p>
<p><sup>[14]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn57">[15]</xref></sup>If any person commits an offense, and sins unintentionally concerning the things consecrated to GOD, he will bring his guilt-offering to GOD: an unblemished ram from the flock, worth silver shekels (of the holy shekels), for a guilt-offering. <sup><xref rid="fn58">[16]</xref></sup>He will repay what he desecrated from the consecrated objects, adding a fifth to it, and will give that to the kohen. The kohen will make atonement for him with the guilt-offering ram, and he will be forgiven.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn59">[17]</xref></sup>If someone should sin by doing any one of the things which GOD has commanded not to be done &#x2014; but he does not know whether he transgressed &#x2014; he has committed an offense. <sup>[18]</sup>He will bring an unblemished ram from the flock, whose value is that of a guilt-offering, to the kohen. The kohen will make atonement for him for the error which he does not know that he committed, and he will be forgiven. <sup><xref rid="fn60">[19]</xref></sup>It is a guilt-offering. He has incurred guilt before GOD.</p>
<p><sup>[20]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn61">[21]</xref></sup>If anyone sins by a breach of faith in GOD: If he dealt falsely with his fellowman regarding a deposit or loan, or he robbed, or oppressed, his fellowman, <sup><xref rid="fn62">[22]</xref></sup>or if he found a lost article and denied it; and he swore falsely in any case concerning which a man may act, and sins thereby, <sup>[23]</sup>When he is guilty over sinning, he will return the stolen article that he robbed, or the article concerning which he oppressed, or the deposit that was deposited with him, or the lost article that he found, <sup><xref rid="fn63">[24]</xref></sup>or whatever he swore falsely about. He will return its principal, and add fifths to it. He will give this to the owner on the day of his guilt, <sup><xref rid="fn64">[25]</xref></sup>and he will bring to the kohen his guilt-offering to GOD: an unblemished ram from the flock, of the value of a guilt-offering. <sup><xref rid="fn65">[26]</xref></sup>The kohen will secure atonement for him before GOD, and he will be forgiven &#x2014; for whichever of the above he committed, being guilty thereby.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1"><bold>[1:1]</bold> Just as the covenant of circumcision serves two distinct purposes [Genesis 17:1; Genesis 17:11], so it is possible for a single commandment to serve many different purposes &#x2014; like the commandments of the burnt-offering and other sacrifices:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) In offering up the appropriate portion at the appropriate time, we who have a portion in the world to come are apportioned proportionately. Thus the word &#x201C;to atone&#x201D; literally means &#x201C;to ransom&#x201D; (this is evidenced in the beginning of the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Ki Tis&#x0300;s&#x0300;a</italic> [Exodus 30:12], and it explains the phrase &#x201C;lest he strike us with pestilence&#x201D; [Exodus 5:3]).</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) The burnt offerings also contain profound allusions to natural history.</p>
<p align="blockquote">3) By studying each sacrifice, one may come fundamentally to understand the nature of sin, and the nature of our obligations to sustain the teachers of the Torah.</p>
<p>GOD <bold>called to Moshe</bold> Since Scripture has already stated that &#x201C;Moshe was not allowed&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 40:35], GOD must have called him from within the Tent of Assembly, telling him to enter therein, where He would speak to him. Moshe used to go behind the Partition, where the Glory resided (for so it is written [Exodus 25:22]).<sup><xref rid="fn66">1</xref></sup> The reason for mentioning the sacrifices before the other commandments is that the Divine Presence would depart if they did not keep the law of the daily burnt-offering (which eventually happened). Perish the thought that GOD should <italic>need</italic> a burnt-offering&#x0021; As it is written: &#x201C;If I were hungry, I would not tell you&#x201D; [Psalms 50:12]. The subject is admittedly too profound to explain easily.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2"><bold>[2] from among you:</bold></ftnote>
<ul>
<li>This word appears later in the sentence than is syntactically called for. The sentence is understood as if it read, &#x201C;any man <italic>among you</italic> who brings a sacrifice&#x2026;&#x201D;. Many Hebrew sentences exhibit similar constructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripture employs synecdoche and connotes &#x201C;from your possessions&#x201D; by the words &#x201C;from you&#x201D;.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>By altering its location in the sentence, and stressing &#x201C;from <italic>you</italic>&#x201D;, Scripture alludes to the unacceptability of bringing offerings of stolen animals. Compare, &#x201C;I hate robbery with burnt offerings&#x201D; [Isaiah 61:8].</li>
</ul>
<p><bold>from domestic stock</bold> The sacrifice must be from this general category. Scripture then specifies <bold>from cattle</bold>, and <bold>from the flock</bold> &#x2014; itself a category that includes the two species of sheep and goats. <bold>your offering</bold> This word is also a general category.</p>
<ftnote id="fn3"><bold>[3] a burnt-offering</bold> This is one category of sacrifice; and its name is self-explanatory [<italic>comment on</italic> 6:1]. <bold>from the cattle</bold> Either a fully grown or a young animal may be offered, so long as it is at least eight days old. Since the entire burnt offering is offered to the Most High, a choice animal must be used. Therefore, females are not used for burnt offerings, because male animals are preferable to female animals. <bold>unblemished</bold> without defects. After having said <bold>he will bring</bold>, Scripture goes on to specify <italic>where</italic> he shall bring it, once he has entered the Courtyard of the Tent of Assembly. <bold>before</bold> GOD This phrase is a displaced continuation of the clause, <bold>he will bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Assembly</bold>. The word <bold>willingly</bold> indicates that he must offer the sacrifice voluntarily, and not out of obligation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4"><bold>[4] He will place his hand</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] It seems from a literal interpretation of the verse that he places a single hand (for we cannot assume that the scapegoat [16:21] resembles the other offerings, insofar as there Scripture specifically mentions how many hands are to be placed). However, the Exegetes, upon whom we rely, have determined that all laying on of hands involves both hands [Yoma 36a]. &#x00B6;The animal which atones for an emergent impulse is called a <bold>burnt offering</bold> [literally: an arising]. Similarly, the animals brought to atone for sin and guilt are called sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, respectively. <bold>it will be accepted</bold> he will obtain GOD&#x2019;s good will <bold>to atone for him</bold> to release him from the punishment due him</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5"><bold>[5] before</bold> GOD The same phrase is used apropos the sheep burnt offering [:11], where the subsequent phrase &#x201C;the northern side of the Altar&#x201D; localizes the slaughter directly opposite the Table. One kohen <bold>will slaughter</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] the animal, but many <bold>will throw</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>the blood</bold>, as it is written: &#x201C;Aaron&#x2019;s sons handed him the blood&#x201D; [9:12]. <bold>the one at the entrance of the Tent</bold> i.e., <italic>not</italic> the Incense Altar</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn8"><bold>[8] kohanim</bold> &#x2014; the use of the plural means that no fewer than two must participate. <bold>the fats</bold> Many contemporary scholars have understood this word to mean &#x201C;the carcass&#x201D;. In my opinion, the word denotes suet. Thus: <bold>The sons of Aaron, the kohanim, will arrange the limbs</bold> &#x2014; the pieces of the body; <bold>[and] the head, and the fats</bold> &#x2014; i.e., the suet.<sup><xref rid="fn67">1</xref></sup> Also: &#x201C;He will carve it into its limbs&#x201D; [:12] &#x2014; and these limbs of the carcass include &#x201C;its head and its fats&#x201D; [:12] (or, perhaps, the phrase means &#x201C;<italic>with</italic> its head and its fats&#x201D;, following common Hebrew idiom &#x2014; but conclusive evidence to the contrary appears in &#x201C;Moshe kindled the head, and the pieces, and the fats&#x201D; [8:20]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9"><bold>[9] will wash with water</bold> This is done either by a kohen or by a Levite. Thus Scripture must specify that <bold>the kohen</bold> is the one who <bold>will kindle</bold>.

<ftnote id="fn13"><bold>[16] its crop</bold> The meaning of this word is known, and it is related to &#x201C;Woe to the filthy&#x201D; [Zephaniah 3:1] <bold>with its</bold> [the crop&#x2019;s] <bold>outer feathers</bold> i.e., with the bird&#x2019;s outer feathers (as in, &#x201C;full of feathers&#x201D; [Ezekiel 17:3]) <bold>beside the Altar</bold> here the word means &#x201C;outside the Altar&#x201D; <bold>to the east</bold> far away from the holy place <bold>toward the ash-heap</bold> not just toward the ash-heap, but actually on it</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14"><bold>[17] He will split</bold> as in &#x201C;completely cleft&#x201D; [11:3], meaning &#x201C;cut&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15"><bold>[2:1] If someone</bold> [literally: if a soul] <bold>should offer</bold> i.e., the soul of a man. Scripture mentions the word &#x201C;soul&#x201D; because the cereal-offering that is described here is a freewill offering; and the word &#x201C;soul&#x201D; is often used to denote voluntary donations (e.g., &#x201C;uphold me with a generous spirit&#x201D; [Psalms 51:14]). <bold>fine-flour</bold> well-ground wheat flour (<italic>sameed</italic> in Arabic).

Likewise, a small part of the oil is taken. However, the kohen kindles <bold>all of its frankincense</bold>. The <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> in <bold>its memorial-part</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;azkaratah</italic>] is superfluous. The word denotes that which serves to remind one of GOD, for Whose sake the meal-offering is brought. Other people interpret the word as a reference to the odor of incense [e.g., Genesis 8:21] (compare, &#x201C;his fragrance shall be like the wine of Lebanon&#x201D; [Hosea 14:8])</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn22"><bold>[11] leaven</bold> the agent that causes bread to rise <bold>honey</bold> also a leavening agent. Many people have said that the word <bold>honey</bold> here, and in every occurrence of &#x201C;a land flowing with milk and honey&#x201D; [e.g., Exodus 3:8], denotes honey made from dates. Grounds for their interpretation can be found in Ezra&#x2019;s book [II Chronicles 31:5].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23"><bold>[12] You may bring them to</bold> GOD <bold>as offerings of first-fruit</bold> This denotes the &#x201C;two [loaves, each made] of two-tenths [of an <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic>],&#x201D; [23:17] which are waved before GOD on the holiday of Shavu&#x2018;ot.

<ftnote id="fn24"><bold>[13] your God&#x2019;s covenant</bold> I have made you party to a covenant, and I have bound you not to offer a worthless sacrifice. Nor may such a sacrifice be eaten: it would be disrespectful.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25"><bold>[14] If you bring a first-fruit offering</bold> Many people claim [<italic>Mekhilta</italic> on Exodus 20:22] that this is one case where the word &#x201C;<bold>if</bold>&#x201D; introduces an unconditional clause. In my opinion, there is no need for such an assertion. Only the bringing of the <italic>choicest</italic> first fruit is obligatory [Exodus 23:19], not ordinary first fruits. Anyone who wishes, however, to bring a freewill offering of first fruits, may do so. <bold>ripe ears</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;aviv</italic>] so called because it is the original form of the grain, from &#x201C;progenitor&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;av</italic>] <bold>ground-grain</bold> The meaning of this word is known (compare, &#x201C;my soul is consumed&#x201D; [Psalms 119:20] even though there the cognate is spelled with a <italic>samekh</italic>, not a <italic>s&#x0300;in</italic>) <bold>fresh-grain</bold> as in, &#x201C;&#x2026;and full ears of grain in his sack&#x201D; [II Kings 4:42]</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn27"><bold>[4] the loins</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>hakksalim</italic>] The meaning of this word is known from the phrase &#x201C;The stars of heaven and its constellations [Hebrew: <italic>ukhsileyhem</italic>]&#x201D; [Isaiah 13:10]. <bold>with the kidneys</bold> [literally: on the kidneys] as in &#x201C;the men came with the women&#x201D; [literally: on the women] [Exodus 35:22]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28"><bold>[9] its suet: the entire fat-tail</bold> This phrase is to be understood literally, for the fat-tail falls under the category of suet. Thus the Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] are in error, as I shall explain in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>&#x1E62;av</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> 7:23]. Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon also erred in saying that the verse should read, &#x201C;its suet, and the fat tail&#x2026;.&#x201D; This interpretation violates Hebrew usage; if it were correct, Scripture should either have said &#x201C;<italic>its</italic> suet, and <italic>its</italic> fat-tail&#x201D; or &#x201C;<italic>the</italic> suet, and <italic>the</italic> fat-tail&#x201D;. <bold>the spinal column</bold> This word is understood from its context, since it has no cognate. Some people derive it from the word &#x201C;wood&#x201D;, but that is far-fetched.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29"><bold>[11] food</bold> [literally: bread] <bold>for the fire</bold> I have already explained that the word &#x201C;bread&#x201D; is often used in Hebrew to denote food in general [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 16:4]. It can refer to fruit [Jeremiah 11:19] as well as to flesh.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30"><bold>[12] If a goat</bold> [<italic>feminine</italic>] i.e., from the <italic>species</italic> of goat, whether male or female, like the sheep [:7]. Scripture does not mention the fat-tail here, or further on concerning cattle, since goats and cattle have negligible fat-tails. Moreover, the sheep native to Israel are known to have very big fat-tails.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31"><bold>[16] all of this fat</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] used here as a collective noun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32"><bold>[17]</bold> Now that the fats and the blood have been set apart for GOD, they are forbidden to you. <bold>an everlasting decree</bold> I shall explain this at length in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>&#x1E62;av</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> 7:23]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33"><bold>[4:2] if anyone sins</bold> by mistakenly doing something that is prohibited, and punishable either by <italic>karet</italic> or by flogging <bold>anyone</bold> includes both the native born and the convert, as it is written [Numbers 15:15].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34"><bold>[3]</bold> Scripture now goes into the details, beginning with the High Priest (i.e., the kohen who is anointed). <bold>that brings the people to guilt</bold></ftnote>
<ul>
<li>He promulgated something that was incorrect, and the entire nation sinned unintentionally;</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>By sinning, the High Priest inculpates every person. This expression is used because it is the High Priest who carries the burden of the Torah. He must be preserved free from sin, because he is personally consecrated to GOD.</li>
</ul>
<p><bold>to atone on his sin</bold> i.e., to atone <italic>for</italic> his sin. Since he is a great man, he must sacrifice a bullock, which is the greatest of the offerings.</p>
<ftnote id="fn35"><bold>[6] The kohen will dip his finger</bold> i.e., the High Priest. The significance of <bold>seven times</bold> is explained in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Balaq</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Numbers 23:1]. Because of the High Priest&#x2019;s great stature, the blood of his sin-offering is sprinkled <bold>in front of the holy Partition</bold>, and</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn36"><bold>[7]</bold> on the corners of the Incense Altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37"><bold>[8]</bold> Except for the organic fats,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn38"><bold>[11]</bold> all of the bullock</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn39"><bold>[12]</bold> is to be burned <italic>outside</italic>, for it is not a burnt-offering. <bold>where the ashes are to be poured</bold> There must be ashes from the Altar in the place where it is burnt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn40"><bold>[14] When the sin will be disclosed</bold> This rule also applies to the High Priest: as long as he does not realize his sin, and as long as he is not informed, he does not bring the bullock sin-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn68">1</xref></sup> The reason why this rule &#x2014; <bold>When the sin becomes disclosed</bold> &#x2014; is mentioned first here, regarding the Sanhedrin, is that the High Priest is likely to inform them of their error, whereas no one is likely to inform the High Priest; he himself must become aware of <italic>his</italic> error. The sin-offering of the Assembly is identical in all details to the sin-offering of the High Priest. Thus, the High Priest is equal in stature to all Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41"><bold>[15] The elders of the assembly</bold> i.e., the leaders. They place their hands for themselves, and for all Israel, since it is impossible for every person in Israel to place his hands himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42"><bold>[21] it is the public&#x2019;s sin-offering</bold> i.e., the bullock. But if Israel should err, and <italic>not</italic> do one of the <italic>positive</italic> commandments, then they must bring a bullock burnt-offering and a male goat sin-offering [Numbers 15:24].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43"><bold>[22] If a chief sins</bold> The verb and noun are reversed, to mean &#x201C;If he who sins is the chief&#x2026;.&#x201D; This verse is a continuation of the previous paragraph, beginning, &#x201C;If the entire Assembly of Israel&#x201D; [:13], as if Scripture had said, &#x201C;and if the sinner is a chief of a tribe, or of a clan,&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44"><bold>[23] When he becomes aware</bold> Scripture employs brevity, as in the case of the High Priest [:3]; but the intent is to include <italic>both</italic> the case when the chief learns himself that he has sinned, <italic>and</italic> the case when someone who observed him in the act informs him. The phrase <bold>he becomes aware</bold> employs a verb in the past tense (as in &#x201C;when you are besieged&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 28:52]). Scripture omits the actor, as in &#x201C;who was born to Levi&#x201D; [Numbers 26:59]. Rabbi Moshe ben Shmu&#x2019;el Gikatilla HaKohen holds that the verb is in the passive voice, for the <italic>&#x1E25;olem</italic> vowel interchanges with the <italic>shuruq</italic> vowel (as in, &#x201C;Joseph had been brought down to Egypt&#x201D; [Genesis 39:1]). The chief brings a male goat, as Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon pointed out when he explained the verse, &#x201C;a greyhound, and a male goat,&#x201D; [Proverbs 30:31] in his commentary on the Book of Proverbs. Although the animal is male, because of the chief&#x2019;s high stature, nevertheless:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) Its blood is not brought into the Sanctuary; and</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) The kohanim eat from the chief&#x2019;s sin-offering, to secure atonement for him, as it is written [:27]; even though the High Priest does not eat from his own sin-offering.</p>
<ftnote id="fn45"><bold>[27] an ordinary person</bold> denotes all Israelites, all ordinary kohanim, and all Levites. <bold>committed an offense</bold> a verb in the past tense, like &#x201C;Isaac was old&#x201D; [Genesis 27:1] [<italic>see also comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 25:18].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46"><bold>[28] a female goat</bold> because his stature is less than that of the chief</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47"><bold>[31] he will be forgiven</bold> This concept is explained in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Shla&#x1E25; Lkha</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Numbers 14:19].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48"><bold>[32] if he bring a sheep</bold> [<italic>masculine</italic>] that is, if he bring from the <italic>species</italic> [<italic>masculine</italic>] of sheep, then he should bring a female, like the female goat [:28]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49"><bold>[35] as the suet of the lamb peace-offering was removed</bold> to include the fat-tail, since the female goat does not have a fat-tail.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50"><bold>[5:1] anyone who sins, having heard admission of guilt</bold> specifically, regarding forbidden articles (as in, &#x201C;you admitted your guilt&#x201D; [Judges 17:2]). Although Scripture employs brevity, it implicitly warns the witness that he is obliged to testify, since if he does <italic>not</italic> testify, he is subject to Divine punishment: <bold>he has committed an offense</bold>. This applies when the witness forgot to testify, and afterward remembered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn51"><bold>[2] or anyone who touches any ritually impure thing</bold> This denotes the carcass of one of the four enumerated beasts (the swine and its fellows) [11:4&#x2013;7]. <bold>or the carcass of a ritually impure beast</bold> i.e., ritually impure as food, like the horse or the donkey <bold>a ritually impure creeping being</bold> one of the eight enumerated [11:29&#x2013;30] <bold>he was unaware of it</bold> and afterward found out. This applies also</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn52"><bold>[3]</bold> to someone who touches a man who suffers from a constant flow, someone who touches someone else who had contact with a corpse, someone who touches a woman who suffers from a constant flow, and someone who touches a menstruant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn53"><bold>[4] pronouncing with his lips</bold> i.e., spoken out loud <bold>to do harm</bold> to someone who is guilty toward him (or, according to Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon, to harm <italic>himself</italic>). The reason Scripture mentions <bold>in any of these cases</bold> here is that these sins must be confessed; but</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn54"><bold>[5]</bold> the other sins that Scripture mentions are negative commandments, and do not require confession before the kohen [but they do require confession before God &#x2014; Translator]. In either case, the sacrifice is the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn55"><bold>[7] if he cannot afford</bold> [literally: if his arm cannot reach] Since it is with one&#x2019;s arm that one generally labors, and it is the arm that acquires objects, Scripture uses this metaphor to allude to one who lacks something. <bold>one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering</bold> Rabbi Yi&#x1E63;&#x1E25;aq said that the reason for the burnt-offering is that, since he could not afford a lamb, perhaps an evil thought entered his head. The more straightforward explanation, in my opinion, is: One provides the equivalent of the fats of a sin-offering that are wholly consumed, while the other is the actual sin-offering that is called for by law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn56"><bold>[11] one-tenth of an</bold> <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic> food for one man for one day</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn57"><bold>[15] an offense</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>ma&#x2018;al</italic>] something that was concealed from him (from the word &#x201C;covering&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>m&#x2018;il</italic>]), here denoting a desecration of the articles consecrated to GOD. He must bring a ram that is worth <bold>shekels</bold> &#x2014; the use of the plural means at least two shekels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn58"><bold>[16]</bold> In the case when he originally sinned unknowingly, and only afterward found out, he must pay for whatever consecrated thing he desecrated, plus one-fifth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn59"><bold>[17] if someone should sin</bold> by violating one of the prohibitions, but did not know that what he did was forbidden, he must bring a ram. According to the majority opinion, this is the adjustable guilt-offering; and it applies when someone does not know whether or not he did the forbidden act. The sin-offering applies when he originally did not know that something was forbidden, and found out after his sin. Thus the sin-offering applies as long as he did not know that something was prohibited, until the point when he knew. The guilt-offering applies:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) when he originally knew that something was forbidden, and then forgot, and afterward remembered again;</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) in the case of the adjustable guilt-offering.</p>
<ftnote id="fn60"><bold>[19] he has incurred guilt before</bold> GOD and that explains why it is called a <bold>guilt-offering</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn61"><bold>[21] a breach of faith in</bold> GOD by doing something wrong to his fellow man <bold>a loan</bold> [literally: an extension of strength] In making someone a partner, one places one&#x2019;s strength at his disposal. <bold>robbed</bold> by force (as in, &#x201C;he snatched the spear&#x201D; [II Samuel 23:21]) <bold>oppressed</bold> surreptitiously <bold>his fellowman</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;amito</italic>] his neighbor, probably so called because they are generally facing [Hebrew: <italic>b&#x2018;umato</italic>] one another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn62"><bold>[22]</bold> The word <bold>thereby</bold> contains an extra <italic>heh</italic>. <bold>and swore falsely</bold> i.e., <italic>or</italic> swore falsely, regarding money that someone wishes to collect from Him. This interpretation is borne out by the phrase</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn63"><bold>[24] or whatever he swore falsely about</bold>. The <bold>principal</bold> denotes either the thing itself, or its equivalent in value. <bold>fifths</bold> Use of the plural implies at least two, so two fifths must be added. Later I shall explain this in greater detail [<italic>comment on</italic> Numbers 5:7]. <bold>on the day of his guilt</bold> i.e., he brings the ram on the day that he repents of his guilt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn64"><bold>[25] of value</bold> like the guilt-offering specified earlier [:15]; but he adds <italic>two</italic> fifths because his guilt was intentional (however, there is a single opinion to the effect that this guilt-offering is also adjustable).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn65"><bold>[26] being guilty</bold> Scripture makes a noun out of a verb in the <italic>qal</italic> form, instead of using the infinitive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn66"><sup>1</sup>This is the meaning of &#x201C;He beholds the form of GOD&#x201D; [Numbers 12:8].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn67"><sup>1</sup>Scripture omits the word &#x201C;and&#x201D;, in accordance with Hebrew usage (compare, &#x201C;a ruby, [and] a topaz, and a rock-crystal&#x201D; [Exodus 28:17]).</ftnote>

<p><sup>[6:1]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn69">[2]</xref></sup>Command Aaron and his sons, saying: &#x201C;These are the laws of the burnt-offering.

<ftnote id="fn69"><bold>[6:2] It is the burnt-offering</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;olah</italic>] so called because all of it ascends [Hebrew: &#x2018;<italic>olah</italic>] up to the Altar. This verse implies that one should not sacrifice the burnt-offering at night, because it must burn on the pyre all night. The word <bold>the pyre</bold> ends in an extra <italic>heh</italic> (or perhaps Hebrew contains both a masculine and a feminine form of the word). <bold>the fire of the altar shall burn upon it</bold> but not outside of it</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70"><bold>[3] a smock</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>middo</italic>] The Sages said [Yoma 23b] that this smock was tailored to his measurements [Hebrew: <italic>middato</italic>]. <bold>on his flesh</bold> a euphemism for his genitals (as in, &#x201C;a flowing from his flesh&#x201D; [15:2]) <bold>which the fire consumes</bold> i.e., which is left over from what the fire has consumed <bold>beside the Altar</bold> by its eastern side</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn71"><bold>[5]</bold> This verse repeats <bold>the fire on the altar will be kept burning</bold> in order to add <bold>it must not go out</bold> (during the day). <bold>each morning</bold> [literally: &#x201C;in the morning, in the morning&#x201D;] This idiom denotes every morning. First he burns <bold>the burnt-offering;</bold> and afterwards <bold>the fats of the peace-offering</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn72"><bold>[6] A fire must continually be kept</bold> The point of this apparently redundant verse is to add the word <bold>continually</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn73"><bold>[7]</bold> This passage supplements what was written in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Vayyiqra</italic> [2:1]. <bold>to offer</bold> This word is in the infinitive form, and here means <italic>shall offer</italic>. <bold>the sons of Aaron</bold> any one of them, hence Scripture uses the singular</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn74"><bold>[8] he will scoop up.</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn75"><bold>[9] It must be eaten as ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot in a holy place</bold> Thus there are two commandments; and &#x201C;Every male&#x2026;&#x201D; [:11] is a third.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn76"><bold>[10] It will not be allowed to leaven</bold> This is the core commandment of Passover. <bold>as are the sin-offering and the guilt-offering</bold> so is the meal-offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn77"><bold>[11] whatever touches</bold> either the meal-offering, or the sin-offering, or the guilt-offering, will be holy to GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn78"><bold>[13] This is the offering of Aaron</bold> or one of his descendants after him. <bold>on the day of his anointment</bold> after the anointing oil has been poured on his head. Many people have said that in this phrase the letter <italic>bet</italic> (&#x201C;on&#x201D;) substitutes for the letter <italic>mem</italic> (&#x201C;from&#x201D;): the intent of the verse is that, <italic>from</italic> the day of his anointment, he is obliged to bring his meal-offering continually.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn79"><bold>[14] baked</bold> This word has no cognate. Some people say it means &#x201C;soft&#x201D;, while others say it means &#x201C;immediately&#x201D;. The <italic>tav</italic> in <bold>you must bring it</bold> and in <bold>you must offer</bold> is the sign of the second person masculine singular future; and in my opinion, so is the <italic>tav</italic> of <bold>well-baked</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>tufiney</italic>], meaning &#x201C;you will prepare&#x201D;. This word has no cognate. Our ancestors have said [Mena&#x1E25;ot 50b] that it is a compound of two words that mean &#x201C;you will bake it half-baked&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>tofeh na</italic>&#x2019;] [the Talmud uses the form <italic>tofehna na&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; Translator]. The grammarian Rabbi Yona ibn Jana&#x1E25; said that the word was similar in form to the word <italic>dukhifat</italic> [11:19], but this is a convoluted etymology.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn80"><bold>[15] completely</bold> (i.e., all of it) it belongs completely to GOD</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn81"><bold>[16] it will not be eaten</bold> as are all other meal-offerings &#x2014; for how can the kohen eat his own meal-offering or sin-offering?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn82"><bold>[18]</bold> All sin-offerings are slaughtered toward the North [Zeva&#x1E25;im 48a&#x2013;48b]. <bold>holy, among the holy sacrifices</bold> i.e., it is a member of the category of holy sacrifices [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> Genesis 9:25].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn83"><bold>[19] The kohen who purges</bold> denotes the one who dashes the blood &#x2014; i.e., the one who purges the sinner of his sin. Many commentators have translated this verb in the sense of &#x201C;to wash&#x201D;, or &#x201C;to render ritually pure&#x201D; (as in, &#x201C;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be purified&#x201D; [Psalms 51:9]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn84"><bold>[20] Whatever touches</bold> the flesh of the sin offering will be holy to GOD, and may be eaten by any kohen. Thus, the officiating kohen has an equal share with his fellows. <bold>whatever sprinkles</bold> Rabbi Moshe ben Shmu&#x2019;el Gikatilla HaKohen said that the verb is in the <italic>qal</italic> form, like &#x201C;shall bend&#x201D; [Job 15:29]. When the same verb has a <italic>patta&#x1E25;</italic> under the <italic>yod</italic>, it is in the <italic>hif&#x2018;il</italic> form. In both cases the <italic>nun</italic> of the root disappears. Compare the intransitive &#x201C;some of her blood sprinkled on the wall&#x201D; [II Kings 9:33] (with a <italic>&#x1E25;iriq</italic>) to the causative &#x201C;he sprinkled&#x201D; [8:11] (with a <italic>patta&#x1E25;</italic>). Although the verb in &#x201C;some of her blood sprinkled on the wall&#x201D; has a <italic>&#x1E25;iriq</italic> under the <italic>yod</italic>, it is still in the <italic>qal</italic> form, (which normally takes a <italic>&#x1E63;ereh</italic> under the <italic>yod</italic> &#x2014; as in, &#x201C;their blood sprinkled&#x201D; [Isaiah 63:3]). Rabbi Moshe HaKohen was correct in asserting all of the above. &#x00B6;Since the peace-offering is holy, GOD commanded us to wash the bloodstain in a holy place &#x2014; i.e., the Courtyard of the Tent of Assembly (for the word &#x201C;holy&#x201D; does not mean the same as the word &#x201C;ritually pure&#x201D;). <bold>sprinkle on it:</bold></ftnote>
<ul>
<li>Scripture omits the subject of the first clause (&#x201C;the spot&#x201D;), and the connective between the two clauses (&#x201C;or&#x201D;). The sentence should read, &#x201C;<italic>The spot</italic> whereupon any blood should fall on the garment, <italic>or</italic> if any should sprinkle on it&#x2026;&#x201D;. In other words, if someone else should sprinkle blood on &#x201C;it&#x201D; (i.e., the flesh of the sin-offering), the kohen should wash the flesh, and eat it afterward.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Scripture omits the subject of the second clause (&#x201C;the spot&#x201D;). The sentence should read, &#x201C;Should any blood sprinkle on the garment, <italic>the spot</italic> where any falls&#x2026;&#x201D;. In other words, you must wash the spot where the blood falls. In this case, to function as the feminine object of the preposition in the second clause, the word &#x201C;garment&#x201D; must be both feminine and masculine (<italic>cf</italic>. the passage dealing with a former <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> sufferer who cannot afford the standard sacrifice, where the word for &#x201C;turtle-dove&#x201D; appears both with masculine [14:30] and feminine [14:22] numerical adjectives).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <italic>tav</italic> in <bold>you must wash</bold> is the sign of the second person masculine singular future.</p>
<ftnote id="fn85"><bold>[21] was cooked</bold> and <bold>scoured</bold> and <bold>boiled</bold> are all verbs in the passive voice. The word <bold>scoured</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>moraq</italic>] has a <italic>&#x1E25;olem</italic> over the first consonant of the root (unlike most words in the <italic>pu&#x2018;al</italic> form), because the second consonant of the root is a <italic>resh</italic>. In Hebrew the <italic>resh</italic>, with very few exceptions, cannot take a strong <italic>dagesh</italic> (compare the similar word &#x201C;thrown&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>zoraq</italic>] [Numbers 19:13]). <bold>Scoured</bold> is from &#x201C;polish the spears&#x201D; [Jeremiah 46:4] &#x2014; the <italic>mem</italic> is part of the root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn86"><bold>[22]</bold> Only <bold>every male</bold> may eat the sin-offering, because <bold>it is most holy</bold>. Only an unblemished person is fit to eat the sin-offering, which has been brought to secure atonement, and from which a portion has been sacrificed &#x2014; and the male sex is more perfect than the female sex. Even a minor is called <bold>male</bold> [e.g., Genesis 17:12]; but in the current context, our ancestors have determined that the term denotes someone at least thirteen years old.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn87"><bold>[23] Every sacrifice whose blood is brought &#x2026; to secure atonement, into the holy place</bold> Here the area outside the Partition is called &#x201C;holy&#x201D;. Even though the Courtyard is called &#x201C;holy&#x201D; [e.g., :9], it is still unholy relative to the Tent of Assembly. The area behind the Partition is also called &#x201C;holy&#x201D;, since it holy relative to the Tent of Assembly (as in, &#x201C;With this shall Aaron enter the holy place:&#x201D; [16:3]). This sin-offering is the sin-offering of the High Priest [4:3] or of the Sanhedrin [4:14].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn88"><bold>[7:1] This is the law of the guilt-offering</bold> The reason for mentioning this passage is to discuss suet, which is not mentioned in the laws of the guilt-offering. I have already shown you the difference between &#x201C;sin&#x201D; and &#x201C;guilt&#x201D; [<italic>comment on</italic> 5:17], even though Scripture sometimes uses the terms interchangeably.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn89"><bold>[8] a burnt-offering of</bold> This word is accented on the penultimate syllable, following the rule for nouns in the construct case when the second word is accented on the first syllable. <bold>it shall belong to him</bold> After having stated <bold>it shall belong to the kohen</bold>, Scripture continues its clarification, that the skin may not be given to <italic>another</italic> kohen.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn98"><bold>[18] it will not be accounted to the owner</bold> After parts of it are offered to the Most High, everything that remains becomes holy (likewise, after stones for the Altar become holy, it is improper for there to be anything unholy left over &#x2014; that is why unhewn stones must be used [Exodus 20:22]<sup><xref rid="fn126">1</xref></sup>). <bold>offensive</bold> as in, &#x201C;broth of abominable things is in their vessels&#x201D; [Isaiah 65:4]. Onkelos translated this word correctly into the Aramaic &#x201C;mera&#x1E25;aq&#x201D;. Some people have wondered how the sacrifice can be of no account once it has been &#x201C;willingly accepted&#x201D; [3:5]. Clearly, it is the intention of the sacrificer that determines the acceptance of the sacrifice. Someone who expected to eat from the peace-offering on the third day never intended to bring a valid peace-offering; for the peace-offerings are intrinsically holy, while the <bold>offensive</bold> leftovers are intrinsically unholy. Moreover, whatever gain he receives from fulfilling the commandment is offset by the loss he suffers from <italic>not</italic> fulfilling the commandment, in the case of a peace-offering. In the case of a vow, since he did not fulfill his obligation, his original delinquency is reactivated. <bold>he will carry his iniquity</bold> i.e., he will suffer the unspecified punishment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn99"><bold>[20]</bold> The punishment for eating <italic>any</italic> holy food while ritually impure is <italic>karet</italic> [22:3] [Karetot 2b]. <bold>while he is ritually impure</bold> either an <italic>intrinsic</italic> ritual impurity (e.g., someone who suffers from a constant flow, someone who has <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic>, or even a man who has had a nocturnal emission<sup><xref rid="fn127">1</xref></sup>) or a <italic>derived</italic> ritual impurity (e.g., ritual impurity acquired from a corpse, or from someone who suffers from a constant flow, or from someone who has <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic>, or from a quadruped that is unfit for food, or from a ritually impure flying or crawling animal).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100"><bold>[23]</bold> Once a certain Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite &#x2014; Translator] approached me and asked if the Torah forbade eating the fat-tail. I told him the truth, saying that although the fat-tail falls within the category of suet (as it is written: &#x201C;its suet: the entire fat-tail&#x2026;&#x201D; [3:9]), our ancestors permitted it to be eaten and forbade all other suet. He then replied, Doesn&#x2019;t the Torah prohibit <italic>all</italic> suet? &#x2014; for it is written: &#x201C;Eat no suet or blood&#x201D; [3:17]; and this injunction is preceded by, &#x201C;it is an everlasting decree for your generations&#x2026;&#x201D; [3:17]. I answered that the abovementioned verse appears in the context of the peace-offering. The phrase, &#x201C;it is an everlasting decree for your generations in all your dwelling places&#x201D; is not an irrefutable proof of his thesis, since Scripture also says, &#x201C;You will eat [from the new crop] neither bread, nor parched grain, nor kernels, until that very day, until you bring the offering of your God&#x201D; [23:14] &#x2014; and there Scripture <italic>also</italic> says, &#x201C;it is an everlasting decree&#x2026;&#x201D;. By this reasoning, we may not eat bread in Exile, since we have not brought the &#x2018;Omer offering&#x0021; He continued to argue, citing, <bold>Never eat the suet of cattle, sheep, and goats</bold>. I continued to refute him, pointing out that this verse also appears in the context of the peace-offering. My evidence is the qualifier in &#x201C;Whoever eats the suet of animals that are brought as offerings to GOD&#x201D; [:25]. Consider the consequences of his reasoning: the abovementioned qualifier is now needed only to exclude from the prohibition all meat that is not brought as a peace-offering (i.e., ordinary meat). Accordingly, this <italic>parasha</italic> specifies that</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101"><bold>[24] the suet of an animal that dies by itself</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>neveylah</italic>] <bold>and the suet of an animal that has been torn</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E6D;ereyfah</italic>] <bold>may be used for any purpose other than eating</bold>. The meat of a <italic>neveylah</italic> and of a <italic>&#x1E6D;ereyfah</italic> are elsewhere known to be forbidden [Deuteronomy 14:21; Exodus 22:30]; but it is the <italic>meat</italic> that is prohibited. Since the suet of such an animal is not brought on top of the Altar, one might think that it is permissible for food &#x2014; hence the verse admonishes, <bold>other than eating</bold>. Consequently, Scripture did not need to repeat the prohibition against blood; and this passage was written to teach us the punishment for eating the suet of sanctified animals. Likewise, the verse</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn102"><bold>[26] Nor will you eat blood&#x2026;</bold> exists only to incorporate birds in the prohibition &#x2014; this is why the suet of birds is permissible [Karetot 4a]. The conclusive proof is that the Book of Deuteronomy mentions that meat of luxury (i.e., ordinary meat) is completely permissible, and in three different places excludes only the blood [Deuteronomy 12:23; 12:24; 12:25] &#x2014; without <italic>any</italic> mention of suet&#x0021; At this point the eyes of the Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite &#x2014; Translator] were opened, and an oath escaped his lips, that he would not rely on his own reasoning for the derivation of the Commandments, but that he would depend on the exegesis of the traditional commentators.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn103"><bold>[33] The right thigh</bold> goes to the one who sprinkles the blood; while the breast [:31] goes to all of the kohanim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn104"><bold>[35] This</bold> I.e., this is the reward for Aaron&#x2019;s consecration, and his sons&#x2019; consecration &#x2014; patrimony.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn105"><bold>[37] installation</bold> as it is written in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Te&#x1E63;avveh</italic> [Exodus 29]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn106"><bold>[38] to present their offerings to</bold> GOD <bold>in the Sinai Desert</bold> for they did not offer a sacrifice before they arrived at Mount Sinai. I have already shown you [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 17:15] that the altar that Moshe built on the occasion of <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Amaleq&#x2019;s defeat was situated at &#x1E24;orev (i.e., Sinai). Israel remained there for ten days under a year, as it is written [Exodus 19:1 <italic>vs</italic>. Numbers 10:11]. Moreover, they did not bring burnt-offerings while they were in the wilderness (as the prophet said, &#x201C;Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings for forty years in the wilderness?&#x201D; [Amos 5:25]). The families of Israel also did not bring the Paschal sacrifice (except in Egypt, and a second time at Mount Sinai) because they had no flocks in the wilderness. Nor did they perform any circumcisions once they had left Mount Sinai; and the majority were uncircumcised when Joshua had them circumcised for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice [Joshua 5:3].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn107"><bold>[8:2] the bullock sin-offering</bold> Scripture uses the definite article because it has already been mentioned [Exodus 29:1]. Likewise, <bold>the rams</bold> and <bold>the ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn108"><bold>[3] all of the community</bold> denotes the heads of the tribes and the elders.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109"><bold>[6] Moshe led Aaron</bold> to the laver. <bold>he washed them</bold> i.e., he commanded them to wash</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn110"><bold>[7] and he secured the ephod</bold> this verb is redundant in meaning with <bold>he tied the ephod</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111"><bold>[8]</bold> Just as the golden &#x1E63;i&#x1E63; is different from the turban, the &#x2019;Urim and Tummim are not the stones of the breastplate. The Tablets are similarly not a part of the ark into which they were placed. Scripture accordingly says that the &#x2019;Urim and Tummim were placed <italic>on</italic> the breastplate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112"><bold>[10] Moshe took the anointment oil</bold> meaning, Moshe <italic>had taken</italic> the oil, prior to Aaron&#x2019;s anointment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113"><bold>[13] Moshe led the sons of Aaron</bold> Scripture appears to belabor the point. Perhaps Moshe led them a second time; or, perhaps the verse means, &#x201C;<italic>When</italic> Moshe led the sons of Aaron&#x2026;&#x201D; <bold>he dressed them</bold> a transitive verb with both a direct and an indirect object</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn114"><bold>[15] purifying</bold> explained above [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 29:14] <bold>sanctifying</bold> for the atonement of all sins</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn115"><bold>[16] He took all the fat on the stomach</bold> the earlier verse [7:3] has &#x201C;that <italic>covers</italic> the stomach&#x201D;; yet another verse [3:3] says, &#x201C;that covers the stomach, and all the fat on the stomach.&#x201D; Understand the following: a great deal of fat covers the stomach, while only a small amount of fat, here and there, is actually <italic>on</italic> the stomach. Moreover, fat that <italic>covers</italic> the stomach can also be said to be <italic>on</italic> the stomach. For these reasons, Scripture employs brevity here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn116"><bold>[17] he burned in a fire</bold> some say he burned it himself; others say he commanded others to burn it. Those of the former opinion bring the words, <bold>as</bold> GOD <bold>had commanded Moshe</bold> as evidence. This evidence is inconclusive, since Hebrew often attributes action to indirect agents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117"><bold>[22] He brought the other ram, the ram of installation, and Aaron and his sons placed</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>their hands</bold> the earlier verse [Exodus 29:19] has, &#x201C;Aaron and his sons shall place [<italic>singular</italic>] their hands&#x2026;.&#x201D;. No difference in meaning here exists between the singular and plural forms of the verb. A great grammarian erred when he said that the meaning of the singular was that he alone was to place his hands first, followed by his sons; and that the plural meant that they all placed their hands together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn118"><bold>[23] right</bold> this feminine adjective modifies the first of two nouns, as in &#x201C;the inner [<italic>feminine</italic>] gate [<italic>feminine</italic>] of the court [<italic>masculine</italic>]&#x201D; [I Kings 7:12]. I shall give the reason for the <bold>lobe</bold> and the <bold>thumb</bold> in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Me&#x1E63;ora&#x2018;</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> 14:14]. We see here that blood secures atonement for Aaron&#x2019;s soul, as it is stated: &#x201C;for the blood atones with the soul&#x201D; [17:11] &#x2014; meaning, it atones through the spirit of life which it formerly contained, in the sense of &#x201C;a soul for a soul&#x201D; [Exodus 21:23]. The phrase &#x201C;she cast it down at his feet&#x201D; [Exodus 4:25] addresses a similar idea.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119"><bold>[26] one ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;a cake</bold> this is the &#x201C;one loaf of bread&#x201D; [Exodus 29:23]. &#x201C;Loaf&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>kikkar</italic>] is probably a unit of weight, but not the <italic>kikkar</italic> used to weigh gold and silver. <bold>he placed them on the fats</bold> Scripture does not mention the lobe and the kidneys, because the lobe is small (it literally means &#x201C;surplus&#x201D;) and the kidneys were together with their fats. It is unlikely that the term &#x201C;fats&#x201D; ever literally denotes the kidneys, although it can denote the tail.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120"><bold>[27] he waved them</bold> he waved Aaron and his sons, just as Aaron was to wave the Levites [Numbers 8:11].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121"><bold>[31] Cook the flesh</bold> they personally (&#x201C;You shall&#x2026;cook its flesh&#x201D; [Exodus 29:31] means that Moshe is to give the command.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn122"><bold>[32] What remains of the meat and the bread</bold> by next morning, as written [Exodus 29:34]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn123"><bold>[33] you shall be installed</bold> the clause omits &#x201C;at the end of&#x201D;. Scripture means to say that at the end of seven days, they shall be installed. &#x00B6;Some people say that they did not leave for seven <italic>days</italic>, but that during the night they used to leave to tend to their personal necessities. My personal belief is that they could leave when they needed to, day or night. A great scholar said that they dug a latrine in the courtyard of the Tent of Assembly, but this is far-fetched. Scripture says, &#x201C;The children of Israel wept for Moshe&#x2026;thirty days.&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 34:8] &#x2014; was there never a moment when they were not crying? By saying that they should stay in the entrance to the Tent of Assembly day and night [:35] Scripture means only to say that they should not concern themselves with other business, and that they should not take walks to any other places. (Compare to, &#x201C;he will not leave the Sanctuary&#x201D; [21:12] as I will explain later.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn124"><bold>[34] That which was done this day</bold> GOD commanded Moshe to do what he had done this day throughout the seven days of installation. Moshe should have said, &#x201C;that which I have done&#x201D;; but Hebrew often abruptly changes from the first person to the third person (as in, &#x201C;Ezekiel shall be a sign for you&#x201D; [Ezekiel 24:24]; &#x201C;&#x2026;and Yifta&#x1E25;, and Samuel&#x201D; [I Samuel 12:11]). GOD <bold>has commanded</bold> Where was this made explicit? In the passage &#x201C;Thus shall you do for Aaron and his sons, according to all that I have commanded you, for seven days&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 29:35], and furthermore, &#x201C;You shall offer a bullock as a sin-offering by day&#x201D; [Exodus 29:36] (the phrase &#x201C;by day&#x201D; here means &#x201C;day by day&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;two daily: this is the perpetual burnt-offering&#x201D; [Numbers 28:3]). Scripture continues with the words &#x201C;you shall sprinkle the blood of the sin-offering &#x2026; and anoint it&#x201D; [Exodus 29:26] &#x2014; this is to be done daily, until the end of the consecration period &#x2014; and finally &#x201C;Seven days you shall perform atonement on the altar&#x201D; [Exodus 29:27]. Notice that this passage employs brevity, and does not explicitly mention the two rams. Many people consequently arrived at the opinion that only the bullock sacrifice was repeated throughout the seven-day period. However, I believe that Scripture singles out the bullock sacrifice because the upcoming passage deals with the sanctification of the altar. The ram burnt-offering provided blood which was sprinkled on Aaron and on his sons, while the second ram provided meat to be eaten; but only the bullock sin-offering secured atonement for the altar. For this reason, the bullock offering is described &#x201C;with atonement&#x201D; [Exodus 29:36] &#x2014; i.e., for the sake of atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn125"><bold>[35] Within the Tent of Assembly you will stay</bold> repeated in order to mention the death penalty. <bold>I was commanded</bold> a verb in the passive voice. Some people say that this refers to &#x201C;according to all that I have commanded you,&#x201D; [Exodus 29:35] even though there Scripture does not explain that Aaron and his sons were to stay in the entrance to the Tent of Assembly.</ftnote>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn128">[9:1]</xref></sup>On the eighth day Moshe called Aaron, and his sons, and the elders of Israel. <sup><xref rid="fn129">[2]</xref></sup>He said to Aaron: &#x201C;Bring for yourself a young calf as a sin-offering and a ram as a burnt-offering, without a defect, and offer them before GOD. <sup>[3]</sup>You will tell the Children of Israel as follows: &#x2018;Bring a he-goat as a sin-offering, a calf and a lamb, within their first year, unblemished, as a burnt-offering; <sup><xref rid="fn130">[4]</xref></sup>and an ox and a ram as peace-offerings, to sacrifice before GOD; also a cereal-offering mixed with oil &#x2014; for today GOD will be revealed to you.&#x2019;&#x201D; <sup>[5]</sup>They brought what Moshe had ordered to the front of the Tent of Assembly.

He poured the blood at the base of the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn135">[10]</xref></sup>The fat, the kidneys, and the lobe from the liver of the sin-offering, he kindled on the altar, as GOD had commanded Moshe. <sup>[11]</sup>The flesh and the skin he burned in fire outside the camp. <sup>[12]</sup>He slaughtered the burnt-offering. Aaron&#x2019;s sons handed him the blood, and he threw it around the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn136">[13]</xref></sup>They handed him the burnt-offering in limbs, then its head.

<p><sup>[14]</sup>He washed the innards and the legs, and he kindled them with the burnt-offering on the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn137">[15]</xref></sup>He offered the people&#x2019;s offering.

When they came out they blessed the people. The Glory of GOD revealed Itself to all the people, <sup><xref rid="fn141">[24]</xref></sup>and fire descended from before GOD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fats.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn147">[8]</xref></sup>GOD told Aaron: <sup><xref rid="fn148">[9]</xref></sup>&#x201C;You must not drink wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you enter the Tent of Assembly, so that you not die; this is an everlasting decree throughout your generations. <sup><xref rid="fn149">[10]</xref></sup>To distinguish between holy and unholy, and between ritually impure and ritually pure. <sup><xref rid="fn150">[11]</xref></sup>and to teach the Children of Israel all the decrees that GOD has told them through Moshe.&#x201D;</p>

<ftnote id="fn128"><bold>[9:1] On the eighth day</bold> We might suppose that by &#x201C;the eighth day&#x201D; the eighth day of Nisan is meant, since the Tabernacle was erected on the first day of the month. However, the Exegetes said that this occurred on the first day of Nisan, and that during each of the seven days of installation Moshe had erected the Tabernacle and destroyed it, in order to accustom the people to it and to instruct them [<italic>see Torat Kohanim</italic> on this verse]. <bold>Moshe called Aaron and his sons</bold> who then left the entrance of the Tent of Assembly, or perhaps the leaders came into the courtyard.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn129"><bold>[2] a young calf</bold> During the seven days of installation they brought a young <italic>bullock</italic> as a sin-offering [Exodus 29:1] and a ram as a burnt-offering [Exodus 29:18].

I believe, though, that &#x201C;bullock&#x201D; and &#x201C;calf&#x201D; are probably similar in meaning when an age is not mentioned. <bold>without a defect</bold> describes both the calf and the ram. &#x00B6;The bullocks of installation atoned for the Altar, while this calf is to atone for Aaron (I have already explained the meaning of the word &#x201C;atone&#x201D;).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn136"><bold>[13] handed him</bold> In Hebrew the literal meaning of the verb is &#x201C;caused him to find&#x201D;. This form is used because a bullock which met the age and appearance specifications had to be <italic>found</italic>.</ftnote>

Aaron had already stepped off the altar, having done the people&#x2019;s sin-offering, and their burnt-offering, and their peace-offering. &#x00B6;Scripture says that <bold>he stepped off</bold> because the Altar was three cubits high.

<ftnote id="fn145"><bold>[4] carry your kin-folk out of the holy place</bold> Some say that the incense had been brought to the sacrificial altar, where the Levites could go; others say that it had been brought to the incense-altar, and that Moshe brought the bodies out of the Tent of Assembly. <bold>holy place</bold> this was the Courtyard, in view of the camp, as I have explained [9:1].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn146"><bold>[6] Do not crinify your heads</bold> Some say that this denotes growing long hair. <bold>do not cleave your garments</bold> i.e., do not tear your garments.

Accordingly, the section beginning with &#x201C;these are the animals&#x2026;&#x201D; [11:2] immediately follows; and it in turn is followed by various other types of ritual impurity:</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn156"><bold>[18] Its blood was not brought into the inner court of the Sanctuary</bold> unlike the bull that atones for all of the commandments, and which can be brought by the High Priest [4:4] or by the entire congregation [4:14]. One might point out that there <italic>is</italic> one sin-offering of a bull that is entirely burned, but whose blood is <italic>not</italic> brought into the inner court (i.e., the golden altar, in front of the Partition) [Exodus 29:14]. Understand, though, that that bull was a sin-offering for the Altar. This goat, on the other hand, was a sin-offering for the people; therefore, its meat belongs to the kohen. <bold>You should certainly have eaten it</bold> it was proper for you to eat it</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn157"><bold>[19]</bold> Many grammarians have said that the interrogatory <italic>heh</italic> doubles the consonant that follows it only when the consonant is pronounced with a voiced schwa, but not with any of the seven other vowels. In such a case the <italic>heh</italic> is pronounced with a <italic>patta&#x1E25;</italic> because the language will not permit two voiced semi-vowels to follow one another. Because the <italic>yod</italic> in <bold>would it have pleased</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>hayyi&#x1E6D;av</italic>] is doubled, they say that the <italic>heh</italic> must be the sign of the definite article, as in &#x201C;the one that came back with Naomi&#x201D; [Ruth 2:6], &#x201C;the ones that are present here&#x201D; [I Chronicles 29:17], and &#x201C;the city that was strong&#x201D; [Ezekiel 26:17]. There the <italic>heh</italic> acts as a relative pronoun, and they say the same is true here with <italic>hayyi&#x1E6D;av</italic>. They also say that the verb <bold>if I were to eat</bold> is really in the simple past tense &#x2014; if it were in the subjunctive, it would be stressed on the final syllable (compare, &#x201C;I <italic>have spoken</italic> by the prophets&#x201D; [Hosea 12:11] and &#x201C;I <italic>shall speak</italic> to you&#x201D; [Exodus 25:22]) &#x2014; and that Aaron refers to <italic>their</italic> (his burnt sons&#x2019;) sin-offering and <italic>their</italic> burnt-offering because the calf and the ram were for Aaron and his sons. <bold>When these befell me</bold> the implied subject is the concern or the anguish over the death of the sons. Because of this, I was unable to eat all of the sin-offering. I only ate &#x201C;that which was pleasing [Hebrew: <italic>hayyi&#x1E6D;av</italic>] to GOD&#x201D; &#x2014; meaning, the minimum that would relieve me of my obligation. &#x00B6;Those Exegetes who maintain that the <italic>heh</italic> in <italic>hayyi&#x1E6D;av</italic> is interrogatory perforce imply that the word is irregular. The same is also true of the explanation which I mentioned above, since in all of Scripture we do not find the <italic>heh</italic> of the definite article used as a relative pronoun in conjunction with a verb in the future tense. If the former Exegetes are correct, then we must translate <bold>if I were to eat</bold> &#x2014; using the future tense as the subjunctive. We <italic>do</italic> find such words in the future tense accented on the penultimate syllable (e.g., &#x201C;lest I be poor, and steal&#x201D; [Proverbs 30:9]). In such a case, Aaron&#x2019;s meaning would be: I was a mourner who had not yet buried his dead; and a mourner who has not yet buried his dead may not eat from the sin-offering (compare to, &#x201C;I have not eaten of it in my mourning&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 26:14]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn158"><bold>[11:1]</bold> GOD <bold>told Moshe and Aaron</bold> because Aaron was the kohen, who must teach others how to distinguish between ritually impure and ritually pure</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn159"><bold>[3] hoofed</bold> an adjective, as in &#x201C;horned and hoofed&#x201D; [Psalms 69:32], denoting anything that can be said to have a hoof. <bold>split</bold> an adjective, denoting an animal whose hoofs are split. <bold>cud-chewing</bold> &#x201C;cud&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>gera</italic>] is derived from the word &#x201C;throat&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>garon</italic>]. <bold>chewing</bold> a verb</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn160"><bold>[4]</bold> Scripture mentions the camel, the cony, the hare, and the swine, because each of these species displays exactly one of the signs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn161"><bold>[6]</bold> The Hebrew language generally uses the name of the male of the species as a generic term which includes the female as well. Here Scripture uses the term for a female cony &#x2014; some say because the male is rarely seen, some say because the male becomes female and back again. The former explanation seems more probable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn162"><bold>[8] do not touch their remains</bold> Scripture does not mention that someone who <italic>does</italic> touch their remains is ritually impure until evening, but we know this from tradition. Moreover, it is a corporal offense to touch their remains deliberately, since by so doing, one violates a prohibition [see also Deuteronomy 14:8].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn163"><bold>[9]</bold> If we were to follow the literal meaning of the verse, without exegetical explanation, we would not permit ourselves to eat fish that are found in lakes, since the verse specifies seas and streams only. <bold>fins and scales</bold> following the traditional Aramaic rendition of the words.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn166"><bold>[12]</bold> The apparent redundancy of <bold>whatever has no fins or scales in the water</bold> is needed to include <italic>all</italic> water, since at first [:9] only seas and streams were mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn167"><bold>[13] Of the fowl you will detest</bold> The precise meaning of the word &#x201C;you will detest&#x201D; is slightly different here than in the phrase &#x201C;Do not make yourselves detestable&#x201D; [:43]. There, &#x201C;yourselves&#x201D; is the direct object of the verb. Regarding fowl, the meaning is: You should know that they are detestable, and you should think of them as detestable. &#x00B6;There is a bird whose name in Arabic is <bold><italic>nesher</italic></bold>. This is evidence, as it were, that the same bird is meant here, since the two languages are related. <bold>the <italic>&#x2018;ozniyya</italic></bold> Although there is a single opinion that this bird is not found in inhabited regions [&#x1E24;ullin 62a], Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon erred by translating it into the Arabic <italic>al-&#x2018;anka</italic>. This Arabic word denotes a creature that does not exist anywhere in the world, and has never existed since Creation except as a fable &#x2014; as their philologists will confirm. It is unlikely that GOD would forbid something that never was.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn168"><bold>[14] the <italic>da&#x2019;a</italic></bold> Here, the word is a generic term that includes two species &#x2014; the <italic>da&#x2019;a</italic> and the <italic>daya</italic> [Deuteronomy 14:13] (compare, &#x201C;but the birds he did not cut&#x201D; [Genesis 15:10], where one term denotes both the turtle-dove and the young pigeon). The Exegetes were correct in identifying the <italic>ra&#x2019;a</italic> [Deuteronomy 14:13] with the more specific meaning of <italic>da&#x2019;a</italic> [&#x1E24;ullin 63a]. Thus Rabbi Yona ibn Jana&#x1E25;&#x2019;s argument (that it is unlikely that GOD would first say the general term [<italic>ra&#x2019;a</italic>] and then say the specific term [<italic>daya</italic>]) disappears. &#x00B6;Some people say [&#x1E24;ullin 62b] that the word <italic>nesher</italic> [:13] comes from the word &#x201C;I gaze at it&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>ashurennu</italic>] [Numbers 24:17]; that <italic>peres</italic> [:13] comes from the word &#x201C;spread&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>paros</italic>] [Isaiah 58:7]; that <italic>&#x2018;ozniyya</italic> [:13] comes from the word &#x201C;strength&#x201D; [Hebrew: &#x2018;<italic>oz</italic>] with a superfluous <italic>n</italic>, and is identified with the <italic>&#x2018;akba</italic>; that <bold><italic>da&#x2019;a</italic></bold> comes from the word &#x201C;will swoop&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>yid&#x2019;eh</italic>] [Deuteronomy 28:49]; that the <bold><italic>&#x2019;ayya</italic></bold> is so called because it tends to dwell in certain islands [Hebrew: <italic>iyyim</italic>];</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn169"><bold>[15]</bold> and that <bold><italic>&#x2018;orev</italic></bold> comes from the word &#x201C;evening&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;erev</italic>] because it is known for its blackness [Song of Songs 5:11].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn170"><bold>[16] the <italic>bat-hayya&#x2018;ana</italic></bold> [<italic>feminine</italic>] Some people say that the male of the species is rarely seen, like the cony [:6]. The existence of a plural form with a masculine suffix [Lamentations 4:3] is no proof that a male form exists. Many female nouns &#x2014; &#x201C;ewe&#x201D; and &#x201C;nanny-goat&#x201D;, for example &#x2014; form their plural with a masculine suffix. <bold>the <italic>ta&#x1E25;mas</italic></bold> from the word &#x201C;plunder&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;amas</italic>]. <bold>the <italic>sha&#x1E25;af</italic></bold> who causes tuberculosis [Hebrew: <italic>sha&#x1E25;effet</italic>]. <bold>the <italic>ne&#x1E63;</italic></bold> who has huge feathering [Hebrew: <italic>no&#x1E63;a</italic>]; probably to be identified with a certain bird of the same name who flies South in search of a warm habitat [Job 39:26]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn171"><bold>[17] the <italic>kos</italic></bold> as in, &#x201C;the cache [Hebrew: <italic>kos</italic>] of the desert&#x201D; [Psalms 102:7] &#x2014; some say that this bird is <italic>hidden</italic> from the eye of man; i.e., it dwells in an uninhabited place <bold>the <italic>shalakh</italic></bold> Some say that the nature of this bird is to throw away [Hebrew: <italic>lehashlikh</italic>] its young. <bold><italic>yanshuf</italic></bold> a bird who flies in darkness [Hebrew: <italic>neshef</italic>], because either the heat or the sunlight prevents it from appearing in daytime</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn172"><bold>[18] the <italic>tinshemet</italic></bold> Everyone who sees it is terrified [Hebrew: <italic>yashum</italic>]. This name is also found among the insects [:30]. <bold>the <italic>qa&#x2019;at</italic></bold> Some people say that it is the nature of this bird to vomit [Hebrew: <italic>lhaqi&#x2019;</italic>] its food. <bold>the <italic>ra&#x1E25;am</italic></bold> Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon asserts that the Arabic name of this bird is <italic>rakam</italic>, identical except for a <italic>k</italic> instead of a <italic>&#x1E25;</italic> (in their alphabet they use the same letter to denote both sounds). Others say that this bird is merciful [Hebrew: <italic>mera&#x1E25;em</italic>] to its young.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn173"><bold>[19] the <italic>&#x1E25;asida</italic></bold> This is the bird that appears at known times of the year [Jeremiah 8:7]. Some say that it disperses charity [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;esed</italic>], but this is far-fetched. <bold>the <italic>&#x2019;anafa</italic></bold> who angers [Hebrew: <italic>yit</italic><sup>&#x2283;</sup><italic>annef</italic>] quickly <bold>the <italic>dukhifat</italic></bold> The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] identify this bird with the chicken &#x2014; what eternal fools&#x0021; Who told them that? <bold>the <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E6D;allef</italic></bold> a small bird that flies at night (the word is quadriliteral).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn174"><bold>[20]</bold> All small creeping beings that sometimes <bold>fly</bold> and sometimes <bold>move on four legs</bold> are a detestation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn175"><bold>[21]</bold> This verse is spelled &#x201C;with no jointed legs&#x201D; but is traditionally read as <bold>that have jointed legs</bold>. The principal meaning is the latter. <bold>to jump</bold> This word has no cognate. Onkelos translated it into the Aramaic <italic>lekappa&#x1E63;a</italic> (as in &#x201C;leaps&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>mekappe&#x1E63;</italic>] [Song of Songs 2:8]), meaning &#x201C;skips&#x201D;; and he translated correctly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn176"><bold>[22] <italic>&#x2019;arbeh</italic></bold> so called because of its teemingness [Hebrew: <italic>ribbuy</italic>] <bold>the <italic>sal&#x2018;am</italic></bold> a species that alights on rocks [Hebrew: <italic>sela&#x2018;im</italic>] <bold>the <italic>&#x1E25;argol</italic></bold> if this word is quadriliteral, it has no cognate. If it is a compound of two words (like &#x201C;that certain one&#x201D; [Daniel 8:13]), then it means &#x201C;leap-legged&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;arag regel</italic>] and its nature is opposite to the nature of the <italic>sal&#x2018;am</italic>. <bold>the <italic>&#x1E25;agav</italic></bold> This word is known from the Arabic.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177"><bold>[23] that have four legs</bold> Scripture has already specified &#x201C;that move on four legs&#x201D; [:20]; but very probably there are creeping things that <italic>have</italic> four legs, but do not <italic>walk</italic> on them &#x2014; they just fly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn178"><bold>[24] Through these you will become ritually impure</bold> Some people say that the winged creeping beings [:32] and the birds that are to be detested [:13] are meant here. Others are of the opinion that <bold>these</bold> has the force of &#x201C;the following&#x201D;, and that all four-legged animals that move on their paws [:27] are meant. I believe that <bold>these</bold> includes all the animals that have been mentioned above. <bold>you will become ritually impure</bold> The verb is in the reflexive [<italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic>] form. Its <italic>&#x1E6D;et</italic> is doubled to include the missing <italic>tav</italic>, like the <italic>daled</italic> in &#x201C;he heard the Voice communing [Hebrew: <italic>middabber</italic>] with him&#x201D; [Numbers 7:89] and &#x201C;the one purifying himself&#x201D; [14:8]. <bold>will be ritually impure until the evening</bold> Scripture employs brevity, not specifying that he first must immerse himself in water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn179"><bold>[25] whoever lifts</bold> These laws are more severe than the laws of contact, as one must immerse one&#x2019;s clothes as well as one&#x2019;s body (this applies to all ritually impure animals). Here also Scripture employs brevity,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn180"><bold>[26]</bold> as it does when it here fails to specify the animals whose hooves are split but who do not ruminate, or the animals who ruminate but whose hooves are not split &#x2014; though regarding both, Scripture has said, &#x201C;do not touch their remains; they are ritually impure for you&#x201D; [:8] <bold>Whoever touches them</bold> i.e., the abovementioned carcasses, becomes ritually impure in the manner mentioned above &#x2014; until the evening. One Sadducee [a derogatory reference to a Karaite &#x2014; Translator] heretic has read this verse to mean &#x201C;Whoever touches them while alive becomes ritually impure&#x201D;. There is no need to answer words of lunacy. Scripture prohibited only their flesh, and specified, &#x201C;do not touch their <italic>remains</italic>&#x201D; [:8].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn181"><bold>[27] that move on their paws</bold> This verse contains the same law which was specified above [:24] regarding contact;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn182"><bold>[28] and whoever lifts their remains</bold> this is the same law which was specified above [:25] regarding lifting. This verse supports my explanation of the word &#x201C;these&#x201D; [:24], since there Scripture also says &#x201C;whoever lifts their remains&#x2026;&#x201D;. The two verses are found in the same paragraph and would otherwise be redundant. <bold>they are impure for you</bold> repeated to include all Israel &#x2014; men, women, and children &#x2014; within the scope of the law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn183"><bold>[29]</bold> We have no way of knowing what these eight creatures are (or the birds listed above) except through tradition. <bold>These are impure for you</bold> through contact</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn184"><bold>[31] These of all the creeping beings are ritually impure for you</bold> These alone, among the ritually impure creeping things, will render other things ritually impure after they are dead. <bold>impure until the evening</bold> after having immersed himself</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn185"><bold>[32]</bold> For the details of these laws, we rely on what has been handed down. <bold>will be brought into water</bold> the clothing or the sackcloth or the vessel that received the ritual impurity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn186"><bold>[33] if a part of them should fall</bold> i.e., if a part of <italic>any one</italic> of them should fall (compare, &#x201C;he was buried in the cities of Gil&#x2018;ad&#x201D; [Judges 12:7])</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn187"><bold>[34] drink</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>mashqeh</italic>] a noun; in the phrase &#x201C;I used to <italic>give drink</italic>&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>mashqeh</italic>] [Nehemiah 1:11] the same word is a verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn188"><bold>[35]</bold> Thus an oven for baking bread and a range for cooking meat are to be broken because they are ritually impure &#x2014; for this is the decree of the King.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn189"><bold>[36]</bold> The Hebrew word for &#x201C;well&#x201D; is a feminine noun and denotes flowing water, as in &#x201C;as a well keeps its water fresh&#x201D; [Jeremiah 6:7]. A <bold>ditch</bold> is a cistern or a hole dug for collecting rainwater. Thus, a well is similar to a <bold>fountain</bold>. There was no need for the verse also to mention streams. The reasons Scripture speaks of <bold>a ditch of gathered water</bold> is that a ditch may also not have water. However, some say that the verse omits a connective, and that the verse should read &#x201C;&#x2026;a ditch, [or] gathered water&#x2026;&#x201D; (as in &#x201C;Reuven [and] Shim&#x2018;on&#x201D; [Exodus 1:2], &#x201C;the sun [and] moon&#x201D; [Habakkuk 3:11]). <bold>that touches their remains</bold> the water that touches their remains will become ritually impure</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn190"><bold>[37] rooted</bold> Either this is an adjective with a form similar to that of a participle, or it is an entirely different word and the verse specifies two things. Evidence for the latter is found in &#x201C;and he gave them vegetables&#x201D; [Daniel 1:16] where a similar word occurs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn191"><bold>[38] Should water be placed</bold> While the field is being watered, one of their carcasses falls on the plant (some say: on the water). The word <bold>placed</bold> modifies the word <bold>water</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>], although its form is singular. Compare, &#x201C;The water [<italic>plural</italic>] of separation was not thrown [<italic>singular</italic>] upon it&#x201D; [Numbers 19:13]. <bold>placed</bold> this verb is in the <italic>hof&#x2018;al</italic> form, like &#x201C;brought&#x201D; [Genesis 18:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn192"><bold>[39] that is yours</bold> i.e., permissible to eat <bold>shall be ritually impure until the evening</bold> after he immerses in water</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn193"><bold>[40]</bold> The laws of eating are severe, like the laws of carrying, for in fact both carry the carcass &#x2014; one inside, and one outside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn194"><bold>[41] All creeping beings that creep on the earth</bold> All creeping beings, including the eight mentioned above [:29], are mentioned again, to specify the prohibition against eating them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195"><bold>[42] belly</bold> as in &#x201C;you will crawl upon your belly&#x201D; [Genesis 3:14] <bold>that crawl on four legs</bold> here, denotes the tiny crawling things, as I have explained regarding the swarming things of the seas [<italic>comment on</italic> :10] <bold>many-legged</bold> an adjective formed from a noun in the construct case</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn196"><bold>[43] Do not defile yourselves</bold> so as to become soiled and contaminated <bold>do not make yourselves ritually impure</bold> for it is known that the body which is eaten turns into the flesh of the body who eats it. <bold>defiled</bold> If this word is understood in sense of &#x201C;defiled&#x201D;, then it is missing an <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> (like the word &#x201C;from the beginning&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 11:12]). Some say, though, that there are two different roots. The evidence for this assertion is the similar word &#x201C;dumb&#x201D; [Job 11:3], denoting a man who has no understanding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn197"><bold>[45] I am</bold> GOD I raised you up out of the land of Egypt only in order to be your God. If you are not going to be holy, I will not be your God. Therefore, if it is your desire that I be your God, you must be holy. <bold>Be holy for I am holy</bold> therefore, I have told you &#x201C;do not defile yourselves&#x201D; [:43]. &#x00B6;The <italic>vav</italic> in Hebrew functions as a general-purpose connective particle, like the <italic>f</italic> of Arabic. Compare, &#x201C;he left his laborers&#x201D; [Exodus 9:21], and many others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn198"><bold>[47] To differentiate</bold> among birds and creatures of the water <bold>that are eaten</bold> i.e., that are permissible for food <bold>that will not be eaten</bold> according to the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn199"><sup>1</sup>This shows that the term &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; applies to fish. When our Sages excluded it in their discussion on vows [&#x1E24;ullin 104a], they were speaking of current usage.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn200"><bold>[12:2] When a woman conceives</bold> After completing the laws of ritually pure and ritually impure food, Scripture now discusses ritual impurity among people, beginning with the law of the new mother, because birth is a beginning. Many people claim that when a woman releases her egg before the man releases his sperm, she will give birth to a boy; and they cite this verse, pointing out &#x201C;When a <italic>woman</italic> conceives&#x2026;and gives birth to a boy&#x201D;. The sages of Greece are of this opinion &#x2014; that the woman contains the seed, while the man&#x2019;s sperm is a congealing agent, and that children are congealed from the blood of the woman. <bold>conceives</bold> literally, &#x201C;yields seed&#x201D; because in her reproductive function she resembles the Earth [Genesis 1:11]. &#x00B6;The <italic>vav</italic> of <bold>she will become impure</bold> is like the <italic>f</italic> of Arabic [<italic>comment on</italic> 11:45]. &#x00B6;The reason for her seven days of ritual impurity is that we wait for her to enter the next lunar quarter (we also find, in the course of an illness, that changes are seen after every seven days). <bold>separation</bold> a noun derived from an <italic>&#x2018;ayin- &#x2018;ayin</italic> verb, like &#x201C;spoils&#x201D; [Esther 9:15]. <bold>her indisposition</bold> similar in meaning to &#x201C;sickness&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;the ailments of Egypt&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 7:15], because the menstrual blood is an unhealthy part of the woman&#x2019;s body</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201"><bold>[3] on the eighth day</bold> Our Sages have said [Megilla 20a]: on the <italic>day</italic>, and not at night. Thus a boy born a half hour before sunset can be circumcised six and a half days later &#x2014; for a &#x201C;day&#x201D; in the Torah need not be a precise 24-hour period. <bold>cut off</bold> a verb in the passive [<italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic>] form, probably an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-vav</italic> verb (like &#x201C;established&#x201D; [Psalms 101:7]), derived from the word &#x201C;circumcised&#x201D; [Joshua 5:5]. Quite possibly, though, it is a <italic>peh-nun</italic> verb in the active [<italic>qal</italic>] form, derived from the word &#x201C;circumcise&#x201D; [Genesis 17:11]. The <italic>nun</italic> would disappear and be replaced by a doubling of the second consonant of the root (as in &#x201C;swear&#x201D; [Numbers 30:3]); Scripture has omitted the implied subject of the sentence &#x2014; the boy&#x2019;s father, or the Court. <bold>his foreskin</bold> It is understood that the foreskin of his genital is meant, as there is no such thing as a foreskin of a heart [Deuteronomy 10:16], or a lip [Exodus 6:12], or an ear [Jeremiah 6:10] &#x2014; these are all metaphors.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn202"><bold>[4]</bold> For a male child, GOD decreed the number of days required to complete his form in the womb. It has been clearly proven that a female child takes twice this amount of time. <bold>she will not touch hallowed foods</bold> even tithes, Teruma, and the meat of peace-offerings <bold>the Sanctuary</bold> the courtyard of the Tent of Assembly, or, in the times of the Temple, the Temple Court <bold>in ritual purity of blood</bold> or, &#x201C;<italic>with</italic> ritual purity of blood&#x201D; [:6] &#x2014; both prepositions carry the same meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn203"><bold>[5]</bold> Although the <italic>heh</italic> of <bold>her ritual purity</bold> should be pronounced as a sign of the third person feminine singular, it is silent and imperceptible, like the <italic>heh</italic> in &#x201C;he called her Nova&#x1E25;&#x201D; [Numbers 32:42]. <bold>the blood of her ritual purity</bold> It is blood of ritual purity (in contrast to blood of separation) and it does not render ritually impure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn204"><bold>[6]</bold> Were it not for the tradition, who would explain to us whether a <bold>yearling</bold> meant exactly one year old, or less than one year old, or greater than one year old [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> 23:12]? &#x00B6;Some people have suggested the reason for the burnt-offering of a lamb: perhaps, in her great distress, an evil thought entered her mind during childbirth. As for the sin-offering, perhaps she uttered it out loud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn205"><bold>[7] He will sacrifice</bold> both the lamb and the young pigeon or turtle-dove. Scripture employs brevity and thus does not mention the breaking of the neck of the sin-offering bird (for the kohen does not eat of the sin-offering when it is a bird). <bold>he will make atonement for her</bold> as I have explained earlier <bold>she will then have ritually purified her source of blood</bold> This teaches us that after childbirth she does not become ritually pure until the end of the enumerated days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn206"><bold>[8] If she cannot afford a lamb</bold> [literally: if a lamb cannot be found in her hand] A similar figure of speech is &#x201C;he cannot afford&#x201D; [literally: his hand cannot reach] [14:21]. <bold>After the kohen makes an atonement for her, she will be ritually pure</bold> This indicates that if the kohen does not make an atonement for her, she is not ritually pure. However, this applies only inside the Holy Land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn207"><bold>[13:1]</bold> GOD <bold>told Moshe and Aaron</bold> Why Aaron? Because his pronouncements would determine, for all the afflicted of Israel, who shall be ritually pure and who shall be ritually impure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn208"><bold>[2] Someone</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;adam</italic>] Scripture did not use the other term for &#x201C;man&#x201D; &#x2014; <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic> (which denotes anyone of the House of Israel) &#x2014; in order to include the foreigners. Compare, &#x201C;any man among you who brings a sacrifice&#x201D; [1:2]. In sacrifices there is one law for natives and aliens alike. Scripture also includes the foreigner in order that he should not render others ritually impure, since <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> is a contagious disease. <bold>let him be brought</bold> willingly or unwillingly. Whoever notices any one of these symptoms may compel him to appear. <bold>Aaron</bold> denotes the High Priest, who will replace him <bold>one of his descendants</bold> denotes one of the ordinary kohanim, who can be found outside of the Temple, like the kohanim of <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Anatot [Jeremiah 1:1]. <bold>the kohanim</bold> excludes those who are unfit to serve <bold>a <italic>s&#x0300;&#x2019;et</italic></bold> a kind of burn (compare: &#x201C;beacon&#x201D; [Judges 20:40]; &#x201C;David burned them&#x201D; [II Samuel 5:21]), whose derivation from the root <italic>to lift</italic> probably owes itself to the nature of fire, which is to be <italic>lifted</italic> upward. <bold>a <italic>sappa&#x1E25;at</italic></bold> from the words &#x201C;reposit me&#x201D; [I Samuel 2:36] and &#x201C;they shall attach themselves&#x201D; [Isaiah 14:1] &#x2014; a disorder that <italic>converges</italic> on one place</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn209"><bold>[3] turned white</bold> Here the verb &#x201C;turned&#x201D; is intransitive, and means the same thing as the passive form of the transitive (i.e., &#x201C;has been turned&#x201D;). <bold>deeper</bold> There is more pigment on the spot than on the skin (&#x201C;deeper&#x201D; here does not mean &#x201C;lower&#x201D;). <bold>he will render him ritually impure</bold> verbally, by declaring that he is ritually impure</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn210"><bold>[4] a <italic>baheret</italic></bold> from &#x201C;bright light&#x201D; [Job 37:21].

<ftnote id="fn211"><bold>[5] to his eyes</bold> meaning, in appearance &#x2014; as appearances are apprehended through the eyes.

<ftnote id="fn212"><bold>[6] second</bold> a second time <bold>dulled</bold> Many scholars have said that this word means &#x201C;darkened&#x201D;. Their evidence is the related word found in the phrase, &#x201C;his eyes were too dim to see&#x201D; [Genesis 27:1]. They said that the oxymoron &#x201C;dark white&#x201D; [:39] is similar to the phrase &#x201C;white-red&#x201D; [:19; :43] &#x2014; i.e., that <italic>both</italic> pigments appear. But in my opinion, the word here means the opposite of <bold>spread</bold>, as in &#x201C;his eyes had ceased to see&#x201D; [Genesis 27:1]. A related word appears in the phrase &#x201C;he did not restrain them&#x201D; [I Samuel 3:13]. The apparent redundancy of <bold>if the symptom has not spread</bold> is understood to denote the appearance of symptoms elsewhere on the body. Thus there are two indicators:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) the original symptom has receded; and</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) it has meanwhile not erupted in healthy skin.</p>
<p><bold>the kohen will purify him</bold> i.e., he will declare that he is ritually pure, since it was only a <italic>mispa&#x1E25;at</italic>. However,</p>

<ftnote id="fn216"><bold>[11] long-standing</bold> i.e., advanced <bold>quarantine him</bold> in Hebrew, a transitive verb with a direct and an indirect object, meaning to command another to close someone off</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><bold>[13] he shall ritually purify the affliction</bold> i.e., verbally, by declaring that he no longer renders others ritually impure. At this point the ailment has left him and has come out entirely to the surface.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn221"><bold>[21] when he sees it</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>yir&#x2019;enna</italic>] The <italic>nun</italic> is doubled here and in the word &#x201C;he will quarantine him&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>yasgirennu</italic>] [:11] to take the place of a missing pronomial <italic>heh</italic>, as in the words &#x201C;from her&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>mimmenna</italic>] and &#x201C;from him&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>mimmennu</italic>].</ftnote>

This word is not used above, at the first mention of the <italic>baheret</italic>&#x2019;s staying in one place [:23], because there the context implies that the <italic>baheret</italic> has not changed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn225"><bold>[29]</bold> Below, regarding baldness [:40], Scripture uses the specific term &#x201C;man&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic>] rather than the general term <italic>&#x2019;adam</italic> in order to exclude women. Here, Scripture is obliged to specify <bold>a man or a woman</bold> because this verse discusses the beard; and otherwise, we might interpret both <bold>on the head</bold> and <bold>in the beard</bold> to apply only to men.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226"><bold>[30] golden</bold> In Arabic this word denotes a near-whitish color. <bold>it is a <italic>neteq</italic></bold> from &#x201C;as is broken a thread of tow&#x201D; [Judges 16:9] denoting the evisceration of his hair</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn230"><bold>[39] it is <italic>bohaq</italic></bold> This root is known from Rabbinic Hebrew [e.g., Sanhedrin 100a]; but it has no cognate in Scripture.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn232"><bold>[41] forehead-bald</bold> This adjective has no cognates in Scripture outside of the current passage. In my opinion, it differs from &#x201C;bald&#x201D; [:40] in that the latter term denotes the upper part of the head. Scripture does not mention women here, because a woman&#x2019;s head does not become bald due to her excessive moisture (hair is a bit like grass in this respect).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233"><bold>[43] like the appearance of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> of the skin</bold> i.e., like the appearance of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> elsewhere on the body</ftnote>

</ul>
<p><bold>his upper lip</bold> denotes above the lip. The <italic>mem</italic> is part of the root (see, &#x201C;he did not trim his mustache&#x201D; [II Samuel 19:25]). <bold>he shall cover</bold> with his garments (from, &#x201C;Who covers Himself with light&#x201D; [Psalms 104:2]). The point is that he should not infect others with his breath.</p>
<ftnote id="fn235"><bold>[46] alone</bold> I have already explained [<italic>comment on</italic> Lamentations 1:1] that the word is an invariant adverb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236"><bold>[48] in the warp or in the woof</bold> The meanings of these two words are known.

Evidence of this etymology appears in the phrase &#x201C;when the foundations are destroyed&#x201D; [Psalms 11:3]. <bold>woof</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;erev</italic>] so called because it is interwoven [Hebrew: <italic>yit&#x2018;arev</italic>] with the warp. <bold>or in a skin</bold> the skin itself <bold>or in anything made from skin</bold> e.g., a coverlet, or a waterskin</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237"><bold>[49] greenish</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>yeraqraq</italic>] from &#x201C;vegetable&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>yereq</italic>], which is likewise green in appearance.

<ftnote id="fn238"><bold>[51] malignant</bold> As in, &#x201C;a pricking briar&#x201D; [Ezekiel 28:24] &#x2014; just as the &#x201C;briar&#x201D; is parallel to the &#x201C;thorn&#x201D;, so the word &#x201C;pricking&#x201D; is parallel to the word &#x201C;painful&#x201D;. The second <italic>mem</italic> in the word <bold>malignant</bold> is part of the root, thus it is not related to the word &#x201C;disaster&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 28:20]. The reason the passage does not mention silk, or cotton, is probably that:</ftnote>
<ul>
<li>Scripture was speaking of materials that are commonly found. Likewise, Scripture says, &#x201C;When you see your enemy&#x2019;s donkey&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 23:5], although the law is the same for a horse or a mule.</li>

He will immerse them and the live bird in the blood of the bird slaughtered over the running water. <sup><xref rid="fn251">[7]</xref></sup>He shall sprinkle seven times upon the man purifying himself of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> and he will render him ritually pure. He will send the live bird off into the fields. <sup><xref rid="fn252">[8]</xref></sup>The purifiee shall launder his clothes.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn261">[21]</xref></sup>If he is poor and cannot afford, he will take for his atonement one ram as a guilt-offering to be waved; one-tenth of fine flour mixed with oil as a cereal-offering, a <italic>log</italic> of oil, <sup>[22]</sup>and two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, whichever he can afford: One will be a sin-offering, the other a burnt-offering. <sup>[23]</sup>He will bring them, on the eighth day of his ritual purity, to the kohen; to the outer entrance of the Tent of Assembly, before GOD. <sup>[24]</sup>The kohen will take the ram of guilt-offering and the <italic>log</italic> of oil, and the kohen will wave them as a wave-offering before GOD. <sup>[25]</sup>He will slaughter the ram of the guilt-offering, and the kohen will take some of the blood of the guilt-offering and place it on the lobe of the purifiee&#x2019;s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. <sup>[26]</sup>The kohen will pour some of the oil on the kohen&#x2019;s left palm. <sup>[27]</sup>With his right finger, the kohen will sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before GOD. <sup>[28]</sup>The kohen will place some of the oil that is in his palm on the lobe of the purifiee&#x2019;s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot &#x2014; upon the place of the blood of the guilt-offering. <sup>[29]</sup>The remainder from the oil in the kohen&#x2019;s palm he will place on the purifiee&#x2019;s head to secure atonement for him before GOD. <sup>[30]</sup>He will sacrifice one of the turtle-doves or one of the young pigeons &#x2014; whatever he can afford. <sup>[31]</sup>Of what he can afford, one of them will be a sin-offering and the other a burnt-offering with the cereal-offering. The Kohen will secure atonement for the purifiee before GOD. <sup>[32]</sup>This is the law for the person who has the disease of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> who cannot afford his ritual purification.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn262">[33]</xref></sup>GOD told Moshe and Aaron, saying: <sup><xref rid="fn263">[34]</xref></sup>When you come to the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I will place a <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;ta</italic>-symptom in the house of the land of your possession, <sup><xref rid="fn264">[35]</xref></sup>the possessor of the house will come and will tell the kohen, &#x201C;Something like a symptom appears to me in the house.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn265">[36]</xref></sup>The kohen will command and they will empty the house while the kohen has not yet come to see the symptom, so that everything in the house will not become ritually impure; afterwards the kohen will come to see the house. <sup><xref rid="fn266">[37]</xref></sup>If, when he sees the symptom, the symptom in the walls of the house is strong greenish or reddish, and they appear sunk into the wall &#x2014; <sup>[38]</sup>the kohen will go out of the house to the entrance of the house. He will quarantine the house for a week. <sup>[39]</sup>The kohen will return on the seventh day. If he sees that the disease has spread on the walls of the house, <sup><xref rid="fn267">[40]</xref></sup>he will command and they will remove the stones that have the symptoms. They will throw them outside the city in a ritually impure place. <sup><xref rid="fn268">[41]</xref></sup>He will scrape the house around from inside, and they will pour the clay they scraped off in a ritually impure place outside the city. <sup><xref rid="fn269">[42]</xref></sup>They will take other stones and bring them to replace the stones, and he will take different clay and plaster the house. <sup><xref rid="fn270">[43]</xref></sup>If the disease return and develops in the house after the removal of the stones, and after scraping the house, and plastering &#x2014; <sup>[44]</sup>the kohen will come. If he sees that the disease has spread in the house, it is a malignant <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> of the house; it is ritually impure. <sup><xref rid="fn271">[45]</xref></sup>He will tear down the house: its stones, its wood and all the clay of the house. He will take it to a ritually impure place outside the city. <sup><xref rid="fn272">[46]</xref></sup>Whoever comes into the house all the while it is quarantined will be ritually impure until evening. <sup><xref rid="fn273">[47]</xref></sup>Whoever lies in the house will immerse his clothes; whoever eats in the house will immerse his clothes. <sup>[48]</sup>If the kohen comes and sees that the disease has not spread in the house after the plastering of the house, the kohen will render the house ritually pure, for the disease has been cured. <sup><xref rid="fn274">[49]</xref></sup>For the purification of the house, he will take two birds; and a cedar stick, a bright woolen thread, and hyssop. <sup>[50]</sup>He will slaughter one of the birds toward an earthen vessel containing running water. <sup>[51]</sup>He will take the cedar stick, the hyssop, the bright woolen thread, and the live bird, and he will immerse them in the blood of the slaughtered bird and in the running water He will sprinkle on the house seven times. <sup>[52]</sup>He will purify the house with the blood of the bird and the spring water; with the live bird, the cedar stick, the hyssop, and the bright woolen thread. <sup>[53]</sup>He will send the live bird outside the city to the fields. He will secure atonement for the house and it will be ritually pure. <sup>[54]</sup>This is the law for any <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> affliction, or a <italic>neteq</italic>: <sup>[55]</sup>and for the <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> of a garment, and of a house, <sup>[56]</sup>and for <italic>s&#x0300;&#x2019;et</italic>, <italic>sappa&#x1E25;at</italic>, or <italic>baheret</italic>; <sup><xref rid="fn275">[57]</xref></sup>to determine the day it is ritually impure and the day it is ritually pure.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn276">[15:1]</xref></sup>GOD told Moshe and Aaron: <sup><xref rid="fn277">[2]</xref></sup>Tell the Children of Israel and say to them: Any man who will have a flow from his flesh &#x2014; his flow is ritually impure. <sup><xref rid="fn278">[3]</xref></sup>This is the manner of his ritual impurity: If the flow from his flesh is saliva-like, or if it stops up his flesh from his flow, &#x2014; it is his ritual impurity. <sup><xref rid="fn279">[4]</xref></sup>The man who flows renders ritually impure any couch upon which he lies; he renders ritually impure any article upon which he sits. <sup>[5]</sup>Someone who touches an article upon which he sat must launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup>[6]</sup>Whoever sits on an object upon which the man who flows sat must launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn280">[7]</xref></sup>Anyone who touches the flesh of the man suffering from a flow must launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn281">[8]</xref></sup>If the man who flows should spit on a ritually pure person, he must launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and he will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn282">[9]</xref></sup>Any riding seat upon which the man who flows rides is ritually impure. <sup><xref rid="fn283">[10]</xref></sup>Anyone who touches anything underneath it will become ritually impure until the evening; whoever lifts them must launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn284">[11]</xref></sup>Whoever the man who flows touches &#x2014; if he did not rinse his hands in water &#x2014; will launder his clothes, immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup>[12]</sup>An earthen vessel touched by the man who flows will be shattered; all wooden vessels will be rinsed in water. <sup><xref rid="fn285">[13]</xref></sup>When the man suffering from a flow becomes ritually pure from his flow, he will count seven days of ritual purity. He will launder his clothes; he will wash his flesh in running water and become ritually pure. <sup><xref rid="fn286">[14]</xref></sup>On the eighth day he will take for himself two turtle-doves or two young pigeons. He will come before GOD to the entrance of the Sanctuary, and give them to the kohen. <sup>[15]</sup>The kohen will sacrifice them &#x2014; one as a sin-offering and one as a burnt-offering &#x2014; and the kohen will secure atonement for him before GOD from his flow.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn287">[16]</xref></sup>A man from whom semen spills out must immerse all of his flesh in the water and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn288">[17]</xref></sup>Any clothing or leather that has semen on it must be laundered in water, and will be ritually impure until the evening. <sup><xref rid="fn289">[18]</xref></sup>If a woman has sexual intercourse with a man, they will immerse in the water, and will be ritually impure until the evening.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn290">[19]</xref></sup>If a woman has a flow &#x2014; blood will flow in her flesh &#x2014; she will be separated for seven days.

<p><sup><xref rid="fn293">[25]</xref></sup>If the flow of a woman&#x2019;s blood flows many days, outside of her period of separation, or if it flows in addition to her separation, all the days of the flow of her ritual impurity will be like the days of her separation: She will be ritually impure. <sup>[26]</sup>Any couch upon which she lies during all the days of her flow will be to her like a couch of her separation; and whatever utensil she sits upon will be ritually impure like the ritual impurity of her separation. <sup>[27]</sup>Whoever touches them will become ritually impure.

<ftnote id="fn245"><bold>[14:1]</bold> Scripture says GOD <bold>told&#x2026;</bold> to indicate the beginning of a new section, dealing with the laws of self-purification.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246"><bold>[2] he will be brought</bold> connotes the same here as it does above [13:2; 13:9], since, once the affliction of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> has gone away, he might not want to bring the obligatory sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247"><bold>[3] The kohen will go outside the camps</bold> Although the kohen has declared him ritually pure, he still may not enter the camps (or the city) until he has offered his ritual-purity sacrifice, and completed everything he has been commanded to do. <bold>The kohen will go outside</bold> This kohen is clearly not the High Priest, which clarifies my comment on &#x201C;&#x2026;or to one of his descendants, the kohanim&#x201D; [13:2]. The grammarian Rabbi Yona ibn Jana&#x1E25; has said that <bold>the affliction of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> has been cured of the person suffering <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic></bold> is backwards: Scripture should have said, &#x201C;the person suffering <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> has been cured of the affliction of &#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at&#x201D;. But why should we reverse the words of the living God on account of our limited understanding? Does not Scripture elsewhere say, &#x201C;the <italic>neteq</italic> has been cured: he is ritually pure&#x201D; [13:37] as well as &#x201C;the affliction has been cured&#x201D; [:48]?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248"><bold>[4] he shall take, for the one purifying himself</bold> i.e., the kohen shall take it from the <italic>other&#x2019;s</italic> property (although one could also say that the person formerly afflicted with <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> shall first give it to the kohen). In the word <bold>the one purifying himself</bold> the <italic>tav</italic> of the reflexive <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> is absorbed into the doubling of the following <italic>&#x1E6D;et</italic>; but the word is truly reflexive, as in &#x201C;one who boasts&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>mit hallel</italic>] [Proverbs 25:14]. <bold>two birds</bold> All species of fowl are denoted by the term <bold>birds</bold>, and he may take any available fowl, so long as they are: <bold>alive</bold> i.e., not dead; and <bold>ritually pure</bold> &#x2014; he may not take from the ritually impure species [11:13-19]. <bold>a cedar stick&#x2026;and some hyssop</bold> These are the largest and the smallest of the species of plants, and we know this from the verse describing Shlomo&#x2019;s knowledge [I Kings 5:13]. (The word <bold>hyssop</bold> is known to us through tradition, and we do not need to investigate its meaning.) Thus the sufferer of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic>, and the infected house [:49], and the ritual impurity of a corpse [Numbers 19:18], all resemble one another; and they all relate distantly to the Paschal sacrifice observed in Egypt [Exodus 12:22].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249"><bold>[5] The kohen will command to slaughter</bold> This command will be carried out by another kohen, or by an Israelite (some people say, the person who had suffered <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> &#x2014; but this is far-fetched). <bold>toward an earthen vessel</bold> i.e., <italic>over</italic> an earthen vessel. See also, &#x201C;I have prayed toward this child&#x201D; [I Samuel 1:27]. <bold>running water</bold> i.e., water <italic>taken from</italic> a running source</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250"><bold>[6] he will immerse them</bold> i.e., the cedar, the hyssop, and the thread <bold>over the water</bold> with which the blood has been mixed</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251"><bold>[7] he shall sprinkle</bold> the diluted blood, after the immersion both of the live bird and of the abovementioned objects. He sprinkles with all three objects, or with the hyssop alone, as in the case of someone ritually impure through contact with a corpse [Numbers 19:18]. <bold>into the fields</bold> an uninhabited place, so that the <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> does not spread</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252"><bold>[8] he shall launder&#x2026;he will shave off all his hair</bold> Scripture does not specify when this will occur. <bold>he shall wash with water and become ritually pure</bold> in the evening, as prescribed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn253"><bold>[9]</bold> Scripture subsequently explains that all this will take place after seven days (this was the reason for Miriam&#x2019;s [Numbers 12:15] seven-day confinement). Scripture also explains, when <bold>he will shave off all his hair:</bold> on the seventh day, that it includes <bold>on his head, his beard, and eyebrows</bold><sup><xref rid="fn298">1</xref></sup> as well as <bold>all his hair</bold> &#x2014; i.e., the hair on his legs, and, according to some, even the hair on his arms, his thighs, and his chest</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn254"><bold>[10] two rams&#x2026;and a ewe</bold> Since the illness of <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> is a rebuke for acts of the tongue, he must offer one ram as a burnt-offering, as prescribed for any emergent impulse [<italic>comment on</italic> 1:4]; one ram as a guilt-offering, following the rule for a guilt-offering [5:18]; and a female for a sin-offering, following the rule for a sin-offering [4:28]; and <bold>three-tenths</bold> in accordance with the principle of one-tenth per lamb [Numbers 15:4]. <bold>one <italic>log</italic></bold> a unit of measurement. This word has no cognates, nor is its meaning evident. These particular rams and lambs (even the guilt-offering and the sin-offering) go exclusively to the officiating kohen, except for the suets which must be burnt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn255"><bold>[14]</bold> He who purifies himself from a corporeal <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> is like a kohen undergoing consecration [8:24]; for sin is like a spiritual <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic>. <bold>lobe</bold> This word&#x2019;s meaning is evident from context, and it symbolizes that one must attend to what has been commanded. <bold>thumb</bold> denotes the joint of the thumb, which is the origin of all activity <bold>right</bold> because of the greater strength of the right side</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn256"><bold>[15] on the kohen&#x2019;s left palm</bold> the left palm of the kohen who is performing the ritual purification (as evident from the following verse). This repetition of the antecedent conforms to Hebrew usage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn257"><bold>[16] before</bold> GOD i.e., toward the entrance of the Tent of Assembly</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn258"><bold>[17] upon</bold> [the site of] <bold>the blood of the guilt-offering</bold> which is on the lobe and on the major digits</ftnote>

The guilt-offering is brought first, because it is the most important. <bold>and he will be ritually pure</bold> Only then does he become ritually pure like everybody else.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn261"><bold>[21] poor</bold> This word can denote bodily ailments, as in &#x201C;poor and malformed&#x201D; [Genesis 41:19], &#x201C;Happy is he who considers the poor&#x201D; [Psalms 41:2], and &#x201C;so lean, O son of the king&#x201D; [II Samuel 13:4]; and it can also denote lack of wealth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn262"><bold>[33]</bold> GOD <bold>told Moshe and Aaron</bold> This phrase introduces the exposition on <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic> of a house.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn266"><bold>[37] strong</bold> This word has no cognates. It is not known whether it is quadriliteral with a repeated final letter, or derived from a five-letter root. Its meaning must be inferred from context. Some people translate &#x201C;symptoms&#x201D;, or &#x201C;threads&#x201D;. Others maintain that it is a compound from sh-q-&#x2018; (as in &#x201C;the fire died down&#x201D; [Numbers 11:2]) and r-r (as in &#x201C;his flesh dribbles&#x201D; [15:3]) &#x2014; but this is far-fetched. <bold>and they appear</bold> Each one of them appears <bold>sunk</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267"><bold>[40] and they will remove the stones</bold> The verb means &#x201C;to remove&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;remove me from the violent man&#x201D; [Psalms 140:2]. <bold>in a ritually impure place</bold> so that they will be clearly recognized as ritually impure, and no one will take them</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268"><bold>[41] scrape the house</bold> from &#x201C;chisels&#x201D; [Isaiah 44:13] and also related to &#x201C;cassia&#x201D; [Psalms 45:9], which means &#x201C;stripped&#x201D;. Some say that they shall scrape the affected region &#x2014; but this is not correct, since the illness has already spread. Rather, they shall scrape everything, but remove the affected region alone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn269"><bold>[42] take</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] and <bold>bring</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] Many people act in unison, quickly [<italic>comment on</italic> :36]. <bold>will take</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] <bold>different clay</bold> The owner of the house will do this if he wishes to continue to live there. <bold>plaster</bold> the opposite of &#x201C;scrape&#x201D; [:41], from &#x201C;they daub it with whitewash&#x201D; [Ezekiel 13:10]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn270"><bold>[43]</bold> If the plague returns, the kohen will come <bold>after the removal</bold> i.e., after his having removed the stones, and after <bold>scraping the house</bold> previously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn271"><bold>[45] He will tear down the house</bold> he will command others to tear it down. In the same sense, <bold>he will take</bold> means, he will command others to take. Most likely, the house had been quarantined for a second seven-day period, but Scripture employs brevity in not stating so explicitly. This is borne out by the phrase</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn272"><bold>[46] all the while it is quarantined</bold> &#x2014; both during the initial quarantine, and during the second quarantine <bold>will be ritually impure until the evening</bold> after having immersed himself, following the usual rule</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273"><bold>[47] whoever lies</bold> These laws are more stringent, hence he must <bold>immerse his clothes</bold>. He must also immerse himself, and he remains ritually impure until evening; but this is not explicitly restated, since anyone who lies or eats in the house also enters it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn274"><bold>[49] he will take</bold> through an agent</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275"><bold>[57] the day it is ritually impure</bold> i.e., the day when a man, or a garment, or a house, becomes ritually impure or ritually pure</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn276"><bold>[15:1]</bold> <italic>&#x1E62;ara&#x2018;at</italic> is a conspicuous disease. Scripture now explains the laws of those who are ritually impure from a <italic>concealed</italic> cause. GOD <bold>told Moshe and Aaron</bold> Aaron is included because it is the kohanim who must distinguish between a woman who has a constant flow, and a menstruant (see the interpretation given by our Sages, of blessed memory, on the passage &#x201C;a matter of blood&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 17:8] [Sanhedrin 87a]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn277"><bold>[2] flow</bold> as in, &#x201C;flowing with milk&#x201D; [Exodus 3:8] &#x2014; i.e., trickling drops <bold>from his flesh</bold> a euphemism for the male genitalia <bold>his flow</bold> here, a noun</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278"><bold>[3] This is the manner of his ritual impurity</bold> to indicate the two different ways that the flow can occur <bold>saliva-like</bold> as in &#x201C;he let his spittle run down his beard&#x201D; [I Samuel 21:14] <bold>or stops up</bold> meaning &#x201C;shut&#x201D;, from &#x201C;it is sealed&#x201D; [Isaiah 29:11]. This describes the situation when the flow thickens, and congeals, so that he can not ejaculate semen during sexual intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279"><bold>[4]</bold> A single law applies to objects that were lain upon and objects that were sat upon; and everyone who touches any one of them is subject to the same law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280"><bold>[7] anyone who touches the flesh of the man suffering from a flow</bold> Here, the word &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; denotes <italic>any</italic> limb whatsoever [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> :2].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281"><bold>[8] If he spit</bold> an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin</italic> verb (witness the doubling of the <italic>qof</italic> in &#x201C;my spittle&#x201D; [Job 7:19]). Even his spit is harmful, because the disease from which he suffers is contagious. Although people do not customarily spit in front of one another, it can nonetheless happen unintentionally: a man with a flow spits, and it falls on someone who was ritually pure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn282"><bold>[9] any riding seat</bold> Provided that, in the opinion of the Exegetes, it can acquire ritual impurity</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn283"><bold>[10] anything underneath it</bold> i.e., anything underneath the saddle transmits a weak ritual impurity. The ritual impurity acquired through carrying is more severe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284"><bold>[11] if he did not rinse his hands in water</bold> It would appear that if a man suffering a flow were to touch food (or any other object) with hands that had been rinsed, then the object should not become ritually impure, since it did not touch the area of the flow. However, we know [<italic>Torat Kohanim</italic> on this verse] that our ancestors all understood &#x201C;hands&#x201D; here to represent the entire body [and rinsing denotes immersion in a <italic>miqveh</italic> &#x2014; Translator]; and we accept their words. Nevertheless, the <italic>literal</italic> meaning of the verse remains: Whenever a man suffering from a flow touches someone who is ritually pure &#x2014; if his hands had been rinsed, then the person touched becomes ritually impure, but not his clothes; if his hands were unwashed, they also render one&#x2019;s clothes ritually impure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285"><bold>[13] of ritual purity</bold> i.e., from his first day of ritual purity</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn286"><bold>[14]</bold> A burnt-offering and a sin-offering are given, because such a flow is an admonishment over sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287"><bold>[16] a man from whom semen spills out</bold> involuntarily <bold>semen</bold> as in, &#x201C;a layer of dew&#x201D; [Exodus 16:13] from &#x201C;who can refill&#x201D; [Job 38:37]. Those commentators err who explain <bold>all of his flesh</bold> as a reference to the male genitalia [<italic>see comment on</italic> :2]: their error lies in ignoring the word <bold>all</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn288"><bold>[17]</bold> It would appear that both one&#x2019;s skin and one&#x2019;s clothes require immersion if semen is found on them, whether the semen be wet or dry. However, the truth is in accordance with the received tradition [Nidda 54b].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn289"><bold>[18]</bold> Having discussed matters that pertain to men, Scripture now turns to discuss matters that pertain to women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn290"><bold>[19] in her flesh</bold> a euphemism for the female genitalia</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn291"><bold>[23] if on the seat</bold> This refers to the abovementioned &#x201C;utensil she sat upon&#x201D; [:22]. The case is that of a utensil atop her seat, or a utensil atop another utensil. Thus, its ritual impurity is less severe. Scripture does not mention a saddle [<italic>see</italic> :9], because it speaks of things that are likely to occur; but the law in such a case would be the same.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn292"><bold>[24] if a man has sexual intercourse with her</bold> unintentionally (for example, if she began to menstruate while she was with him. It is in this sense that we understand the word <bold>upon him</bold>), since <italic>karet</italic> applies to the man who <italic>intentionally</italic> sleeps with a menstruant. The same law applies to a woman with a constant flow, although it is not explicitly mentioned. <bold>all that he lies upon will become ritually impure</bold> for he is ritually impure for seven days. Consequently, he can also render other people ritually impure, although this is not explicitly stated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn293"><bold>[25] many days, outside of her period of separation</bold> every woman has regular periods. This verse also describes a woman who suffers a constant flow immediately after her usual separation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn294"><bold>[29] and she will bring them</bold> a very strange word, because it is stressed on the ultima</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn295"><bold>[31] you will keep disassociated</bold> Some people explain that this word is missing a <italic>heh</italic>, and that it means &#x201C;you will warn them&#x201D;. This, however, is unlikely, because a <italic>heh</italic> does not indicate diphthongs &#x2014; only at the end of a word does it become silent or disappear. Rather, the word is related to &#x201C;they will abstain from the sacrifices&#x2026;&#x201D; [22:2] and means, &#x201C;you will distance them&#x201D;. The word &#x201C;Nazirite&#x201D; &#x2014; one who distances himself from worldly desires &#x2014; stems from the same root. This verb&#x2019;s form parallels that of &#x201C;You shall divide [actually, &#x201C;When you divide&#x201D; &#x2014; Translator] the land by lot&#x201D; [Ezekiel 45:1]: the root <italic>nun</italic> disappears in the <italic>dagesh</italic>. <bold>they will not die in their ritual impurity</bold> i.e., they will not die <italic>because</italic> of their ritual impurity as a consequence of <bold>defiling My Sanctuary</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn296"><bold>[32] to become thereby ritually impure</bold> for it is obligatory that he remain ritually impure. I shall explain this later at greater length [<italic>comment on</italic> 19:31].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn297"><bold>[33] for the man</bold> mentioned above, in &#x201C;this is the law for the man suffering from a constant flow&#x201D; [:32] <bold>with a ritually impure woman</bold> either a menstruant, or a woman suffering from a constant flow.</ftnote>

He will remove the linen garments he wore when he went into the Holiness, and he will cache them there. <sup><xref rid="fn315">[24]</xref></sup>He will immerse his flesh in the water, in a holy place, and he will don his garments. He will go out and sacrifice his burnt-offering and the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering, securing atonement for himself and for the people. <sup><xref rid="fn316">[25]</xref></sup>He will kindle the suet of the sin-offering on the altar. <sup><xref rid="fn317">[26]</xref></sup>The man who sent the he-goat to &#x2018;Azazel will launder his clothes and he will immerse himself in water.

<ftnote id="fn301"><bold>[3] with a bullock</bold> This does not mean that he should bring the bullock into the Holy of Holies. Rather, it means that he must first sacrifice his own bullock as a sin-offering, to atone for himself and for the kohanim (some say that his bullock also atones for the Levites, because they came across the verse &#x201C;You will inscribe Aaron&#x2019;s name upon the rod of the Levite tribe&#x201D; [Numbers 17:18] &#x2014; but this is far-fetched; the Levites are reckoned with the rest of Israel).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302"><bold>[4] a consecrated linen tunic</bold> This verse does not mention the breastplate, or the ephod, or its robe, since they are already mentioned in the passage that ends in the verse &#x201C;its sound shall be heard when he enters the holy place&#x2026;.&#x201D; [Exodus 28:35]. However, the men of the Second Temple did learn from this verse that the High Priest may officiate without the &#x2019;Urim and the Tummim (moreover, there were prophets then to take their place).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303"><bold>[6] Aaron will offer the bullock sin-offering</bold> toward the entrance to the Tent of Assembly, as the usual manner. <bold>make atonement for himself</bold> After he slaughters it, he atones thereby for himself and for his family (some say that merely designating the bullock constitutes atonement).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304"><bold>[8] lots</bold> These objects are known to us through the tradition which we have received from our ancestors. Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon said that <bold>&#x2018;Azazel</bold> is the name of a mountain, so called because it is mighty [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;az</italic>]. A divine name [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;el</italic>, powerful] appears as a suffix, in the sense of &#x201C;the great mountains&#x201D; [Psalms 36:7] and &#x201C;Yequti&#x2019;el&#x201D; [literally, &#x201C;hope in the Mighty One&#x201D;] [I Chronicles 4:18]. The Gaon Halevy<sup><xref rid="fn365">1</xref></sup> held that the word <bold>&#x2018;Azazel</bold> does not contain such a suffix, because its <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> appears between two <italic>zayin&#x2019;s</italic>. Some say that this mountain is near Mount Sinai, and that GOD commanded us to lead the goat up the mountain and to slaughter it there. Afterward, during the time of the Second Temple, the goat used to be led to a different mountain. The evidence that the particulars were reinterpreted is the otherwise superfluous verse &#x201C;Aaron did everything&#x2026;&#x201D; [8:36]. In my opinion the festival of Shavu&#x2018;ot was treated similarly, as I shall explain in its place [<italic>comment on</italic> 23:11]. One commentator has pointed out that the service in the Second Temple differed from the service in the First Temple: the High Priest lacked certain garments, and there was no ark-cover. He suggested that, originally, the scapegoat was sent into the <italic>wilderness</italic>, for so it is written: &#x201C;he will send the goat into the desert&#x201D; [:22]. The purpose is the same as that of the bird send &#x201C;into the fields&#x201D; [14:7] &#x2014; an uninhabited place &#x2014; in the case of someone purifying himself from <italic>&#x1E63;ara&#x2018;at</italic>. As conclusive evidence, he cites the phrase &#x201C;to a barren region&#x201D; [:22]. We may rebut this argument thus: The goat is first sent into the wilderness, as it is written. It is then pursued until it flees atop a high rock &#x2014; at which point, in the words of our Sages, &#x201C;he pushes it from behind&#x201D; [Yoma 67a].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn305"><bold>[9] he will sacrifice it as a sin-offering</bold> i.e., he will designate it for slaughter. Gaon Shmu&#x2019;el ben &#x1E24;ofni HaKohen has said that, although the sin-offering goat is marked <bold>for</bold> GOD, the scapegoat is also for GOD. Scripture does not require his explanation, though, because the scapegoat is not a <italic>sacrifice</italic>, since it is not slaughtered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn306"><bold>[10] will be stood up</bold> a verb in the passive, <italic>hof&#x2018;al</italic> form. Normally the <italic>yod</italic> would be vocalized with a <italic>qubbu&#x1E63;</italic>; but the subsequent guttural letter causes the vowel to be lengthened to a <italic>qama&#x1E63; qa&#x1E6D;an</italic>. Compare &#x201C;all his substance shall be forfeited&#x201D; [Ezra 10:8]. <bold>to make atonement on it</bold> through it, atonement will occur &#x2014; and this will be accomplished by <bold>sending it</bold> away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn307"><bold>[11]</bold> After digressing somewhat on the subject of the goats, Scripture continues where it left off. <bold>Aaron will offer</bold> After bringing the bullock and the two goats to the Tent of Assembly, he begins by slaughtering his bullock.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308"><bold>[12] the pan</bold> the one which had been designated <bold>fistsful</bold> both fists <bold>fragrant incense</bold> of the type already specified [Exodus 30:35]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn309"><bold>[14]</bold> We might think that the phrases <bold>upon the ark-cover</bold> and <bold>in front of the ark-cover</bold> are to be understood literally. However, the Exegetes have said [Yoma 52b; Yoma 54a] that <bold>upon the ark-cover</bold> means &#x201C;between the poles&#x201D;; while the true meaning of <bold>in front of the ark-cover</bold> is known only from their words [Yoma 55a].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310"><bold>[15] He will slaughter the he-goat sin-offering that belongs to the people</bold> Only now does he slaughter it, after emerging from the Holy of Holies &#x2014; though some have incorrectly claimed that he slaughters it before the bullock [<italic>comment on</italic> :9].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn311"><bold>[16] he will perform atonement for the holiness</bold> i.e., for the Holy of Holies <bold>atonement</bold> The blood will serve as a ransom, so that he not be destroyed on account of the ritual impurity of others. <bold>So will he do for the Tent of Assembly</bold> i.e., he will sprinkle seven times before the ark-cover and on the corners of the incense altar</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn312"><bold>[17] no person</bold> among the kohanim <bold>to make atonement within the holiness</bold> i.e., inside the Holy of Holies <bold>he will perform atonement for himself and for his household</bold> through his bullock sin-offering <bold>and for the entire community of Israel</bold> through their ram sin-offering</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn313"><bold>[18] he will go out to the altar</bold> This denotes the sacrificial altar [according to <italic>halakha</italic>, it denotes the incense altar &#x2014; Translator].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn314"><bold>[21] he will put them</bold> After they depart from Israel, it is as if they are given over onto the head of the goat, and they go to a place where they will never more be noticed. Scripture speaks this way so that everyone can understand it. <bold>designated</bold> [literally: for the moment] someone who had been prepared for this moment (or, someone accustomed to go at any moment on Yom Kippur). The <italic>yod</italic> forms an adjective from the noun &#x201C;moment&#x201D;, as in the adjective &#x201C;inner&#x201D; [I Kings 6:27]. Those people who translate the word as &#x201C;well-informed&#x201D; are wrong, in my opinion. Our Sages, whose words are true, said [Yoma 66a] that this person was a kohen.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn315"><bold>[24] in a holy place</bold> in the courtyard of the Tent of Assembly (they used to raise a screen so he could undress). <bold>his garments</bold> which he wears every day (but some people assert that these <bold>garments</bold> are the ones mentioned in the previous verse; and as evidence they cite the absence of the phrase &#x201C;he will put on other garments&#x201D; [6:4]). <bold>his burnt-offering</bold> his ram <bold>the people&#x2019;s burnt-offering</bold> This includes the people&#x2019;s ram, and their bullock, and their seven lambs, for so it is written [Numbers 29:8].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn316"><bold>[25] the suet of the sin-offering:</bold></ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) the suet of the bullock sin-offering [:11]</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) the suet of the goat sin-offering [:15]</p>
<p align="blockquote">3) the suet of the kid sin-offering (an ordinary kohen&#x2019;s offering which is not entirely burned, as described in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Pin&#x1E25;as</italic> [Numbers 29:11])</p>
<ftnote id="fn317"><bold>[26] he will immerse himself in water</bold> This is sufficient, as he is <italic>not</italic> ritually impure until evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn318"><bold>[27] he will take out</bold> i.e., he will tell an agent to do it <bold>They will burn</bold> The kohanim will burn it, and</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319"><bold>[28]</bold> each of them will immerse himself in water, and immediately return to the camp. The fact that Scripture says <bold>he will enter the camp</bold> is evidence that their return was immediate &#x2014; otherwise, what point is there in mentioning it?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn320"><bold>[29] It will be an everlasting decree for you</bold> i.e., this sacrificial service <bold>in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, you will afflict your souls</bold> From the passage &#x201C;let your soul delight in fatness&#x201D; [Isaiah 55:2] we know that &#x201C;affliction&#x201D; of a soul must be the opposite of its delight &#x2014; i.e., a fast. Moreover, the phrase &#x201C;be generous to the hungry&#x201D; [Isaiah 58:10] means the same as &#x201C;satisfy the afflicted soul&#x201D; [Isaiah 58:10], because the prophetic style is to speak in parallelisms. Since we possess a tradition for the meaning of this idiom, there is no need to adduce additional evidence (the phrase &#x201C;I afflicted my soul with fasting&#x201D; [Psalms 35:13] does <italic>not</italic> provide additional evidence, because there the word &#x201C;fasting&#x201D; is explicitly mentioned). The general rule is: &#x201C;affliction of soul&#x201D; denotes fasting, wherever it appears in Scripture. <bold>the native, and the convert who dwells amid you</bold> We do not allow him to work, but we do not exclude him on account of the fast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321"><bold>[30] performs atonement</bold> The High Priest shall perform atonement for you. Regarding the scapegoat, the Exegetes have said that the phrase &#x201C;will be stood up alive&#x2026;to make atonement&#x201D; [:10] means that the kohen performs atonement in the act of standing it up. <bold>from all your sins</bold> As I have explained, [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 34:6], the noun &#x201C;sin&#x201D; is a general category. You will find it used to denote both unintentional acts [Deuteronomy 19:15] and intentional thoughts [Isaiah 30:1].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn322"><bold>[31] a Sabbath of Sabbath</bold> Some say that this phrase means, &#x201C;a Sabbath for the spirit, and a Sabbath for the body&#x201D;. Others interpret in the sense of &#x201C;the Sabbath of all Sabbaths&#x201D; &#x2014; i.e., the loftiest of all Sabbaths. It is also plausible that the two words are synonyms, and that they often appear one after another [<italic>see</italic> Exodus 16:23]. <bold>an everlasting decree</bold> to fast</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn323"><bold>[32] the kohen will perform atonement</bold> Scripture now returns to the previous discussion, explaining over what the kohen performs atonement. <bold>anointed</bold> the one who is anointed with the anointing-oil, after being consecrated <bold>wearing</bold> the one who wears these holy garments &#x2014; for no one else may wear them</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn324"><bold>[33] the holy sanctuary</bold> the area inside the Partition <bold>he will perform atonement for the kohanim and for the entire people &#x2014; the community</bold> The Levites are included in the latter category, because they are not kohanim (although every kohen is a Levite, not every Levite is a kohen).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325"><bold>[34] this will be for you&#x2026;</bold> This has been said before [:29], but is here repeated to add the phrase <bold>once a year. He did</bold> i.e., Aaron did.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn326"><bold>[17:2] Tell Aaron and his sons</bold> for they constitute Israel&#x2019;s ritual slaughterers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327"><bold>[3]</bold> If Scripture had <italic>only</italic> said <bold>in the camp</bold>, it would be permissible to slaughter animals anywhere outside of the camp.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn328"><bold>[4]</bold> The commandment that is herein given also applies to the Temple; but there it covers only the districts close to Jerusalem (the definition of &#x201C;close&#x201D; is known from tradition [Qiddushin 57b]). In faraway places one may simply slaughter the animal and eat its flesh (for so it is written [Deuteronomy 12:21]). Many people have incorrectly said that, during the Exile, <italic>all</italic> flesh is forbidden. They assert that the passage &#x201C;nor did meat or wine come into my mouth&#x201D; [Daniel 10:3] denotes an additional abstinence from the flesh of fish. I do not wish to spend time refuting them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn329"><bold>[5] In order that the Children of Israel will bring</bold> This is the reason for the commandment. The meaning of <old>on the open field</old> is given in the subsequent verse, &#x201C;They will then stop&#x2026;&#x201D; [:7].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn330"><bold>[7] to the satyrs</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>las&#x0300;s&#x0300;<sup>&#x0259;&#x2282;</sup>irim</italic>] These are the demons, so called because when one sees them, one&#x2019;s body convulses [Hebrew: <italic>yis&#x0300;ta&#x2018;er</italic>]. Also, the lunatics who see these demons experience visions of goat-like creatures [Hebrew: <italic>s&#x0300;<sup>&#x0259;</sup>&#x2019;irim</italic>]. The word <bold>no longer</bold> teaches that, in Egypt, this <italic>had</italic> been Israel&#x2019;s practice. <bold>they stray</bold> [literally: they prostitute themselves] Anyone who summons demons, or believes in them, is faithless to his God. He thinks that benefit or harm can come from a source other than GOD, the Glorious and Awesome. This passage does not mention the resident alien, because it pertains to Israel&#x2019;s sacrificial offerings; however, the subsequent passage</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn331"><bold>[8]</bold> <italic>does</italic> mention the resident alien. Here the resident alien is mentioned because Israel must not allow an alien to offer idolatrous sacrifices within the Land of Israel. Likewise,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332"><bold>[10]</bold> they may not drink blood, which is forbidden</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333"><bold>[11]</bold> because it represents life: <bold>the life of the body depends on the blood</bold> (A man lives by means of the blood which comes from his heart.) <bold>atones with the soul</bold> The blood secures atonement by means of the animal spirit which it formerly contained (in the sense of &#x201C;a soul for a soul&#x201D; [Exodus 21:23]). Other people interpret <bold>atones with the soul</bold> as a reference to the human soul, as in, <bold>to atone for your lives</bold> [literally: for your souls]. This interpretation is senseless, because it would make the verse redundant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn334"><bold>[13] a game animal</bold> like a deer or a gazelle <bold>or a bird that may be eaten</bold> We learn from this verse that we also may not permit a resident alien to eat pork, or horseflesh, or a bird of prey<sup><xref rid="fn366">1</xref></sup> in the land of Israel. &#x00B6;We are commanded not to eat blood [:10]. When we slaughter an animal fit to be sacrificed, we are further commanded to spill its blood on the Altar only [:4], and nowhere else. Consequently, GOD commanded us to conceal the blood of any slaughtered animal which is <italic>not</italic> offered as a sacrifice &#x2014; probably so that no one might see the blood of a deer, or a gazelle, or a bird, and mistakenly think that it was a sacrifice to a foreign god. In the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>R&#x2019;eh</italic> I shall explain a more profound meaning to this verse [<italic>comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 12:25].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn335"><bold>[14] its life depends on its blood</bold> The blood is bound up with the breath of life (it is well known that there are two categories of veins coming out of the left side of the heart: those that carry blood, and those that carry the breath), as the olive oil in an oil lamp is bound up with the fire. <bold>therefore I say</bold> i.e., therefore I <italic>have said</italic>, in the current passage. &#x00B6;After mentioning wild animals, and birds, which are not sacrificed,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn336"><bold>[15]</bold> Scripture now mentions <bold>Whoever eats the carcass of an animal that has died on its own, or of an animal that has been torn by wild beasts</bold> &#x2014; because such flesh is also not sacrificed (Another reason for juxtaposing these two passages is that the previous passage mentions hunting). Someone who <italic>intentionally</italic> eats such flesh violates a negative commandment, and incurs corporal punishment; if he <italic>unintentionally</italic> eats it, he must bring a sin-offering. <bold>the stranger</bold> Here an objection can be raised: Does not Scripture elsewhere assert, &#x201C;you may give it to the stranger who is within your gates, and he may eat it&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 14:21]? The answer is that there the resident alien is meant; this verse, on the other hand, describes &#x201C;the stranger who dwells among you&#x201D; [16:29] &#x2014; i.e., a proselyte. We must not allow a proselyte to eat an animal that has died on its own; but we may give it to a resident alien passing through our gates, for him to eat it outside.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn337"><bold>[16] he will bear his iniquity</bold> forever &#x2014; until his iniquity is forgiven through the punishments which GOD will bring upon him. &#x00B6;Because the current passage deals with demon-worship &#x2014; an Egyptian practice &#x2014; it is attached to the upcoming passage on incest &#x2014; a Canaanite practice (this is borne out by the explanation given at the end of that passage [18:27]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn338"><bold>[18:2] I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold> here means: Only on the following conditions will I be your God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn339"><bold>[3] the deeds of the land of Egypt</bold> denotes the Egyptian legal system (as we see from the subsequent phrase, &#x201C;Practice <italic>My</italic> judgments&#x201D; [:4] &#x2014; referring to the judgments that GOD promulgated in the Book of the Covenant, which is detailed in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Mishpa&#x1E6D;im</italic> [Exodus 24:7]). <bold>Do not follow their customs</bold> One must not develop a habit of behaving their way, until he ultimately becomes accustomed to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn340"><bold>[4] I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold> i.e., only then will I be your God</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn341"><bold>[5]</bold> This verse explains that <bold>My statutes and My laws</bold> bring life to those who practice them &#x2014; life in this world, and life in the World to Come. Whoever grasps the inner meaning of GOD&#x2019;s laws will enjoy eternal life, and never die. Accordingly, the verse concludes with <bold>I am</bold> GOD, as I have explained [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 6:8].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn342"><bold>[6] anyone</bold> without exception. Since the verse does not mention &#x201C;of the House of Israel&#x201D; [e.g., 17:3], we must not allow a resident alien to perform any of these enumerated abominations in our land. He may not pollute our land [<italic>see</italic> Numbers 35:34]. <bold>do not come close</bold> a euphemism for sexual intercourse, as in &#x201C;I came near to the prophetess&#x201D; [Isaiah 8:3] (compare the related euphemism, &#x201C;do not approach women&#x201D; [Exodus 19:15]). <bold>with his near kin</bold> This term denotes incest in general. Afterward, its particulars will be listed (HaRav Aaron ben Yosef Sargado HaKohen said that the apparent redundancy of this verse is needed to exclude &#x201C;wasting of seed&#x201D; from the incest prohibition). <bold>nakedness</bold> something indecent, something which must be covered if it is laid bare <bold>I am</bold> GOD GOD loves someone who withdraws from the world in order to serve Him and to understand His words (for example, men and women had to separate from one another three days before the revelation at Sinai). This mystery applied to the very first man [<italic>comment on</italic> Genesis 1:6] and is intrinsic to the human condition. Since human impulses are animalistic by nature, it was not feasible to forbid <italic>all</italic> women; but He did forbid all those with whom one is constantly in contact (In the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Ki Te&#x1E63;eh</italic> I shall further reveal a deep and hidden mystery [<italic>comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 23:10]). The phrase <bold>I am</bold> GOD suggests that by dirtying oneself carnally, one distances himself from the Holy and Revealed Name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn343"><bold>[7] your father</bold> Scripture begins with the father (because the father precedes the son), and forbids a son from having relations with anyone who is a near kin of his father or mother. This primarily denotes his mother, and</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344"><bold>[8]</bold> secondarily denotes his father&#x2019;s wife even if she is not his mother. Afterward,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345"><bold>[9]</bold> Scripture lists his sister, whether she is his father&#x2019;s daughter or his mother&#x2019;s daughter. <bold>born of the house</bold> i.e., born according to the ways of the House of Israel: after betrothal and wedlock. <bold>born outside</bold> i.e., born outside of wedlock. Other people interpret <bold>born</bold> in the sense of &#x201C;were brought up under Joseph&#x2019;s guidance&#x201D; [Genesis 50:23] &#x2014; she is forbidden to you whether she grew up with you in the same house, or whether she lived in a different town or country and grew up <bold>outside</bold> of your father&#x2019;s house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn346"><bold>[10]</bold> Scripture then proceeds to mention his granddaughter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn347"><bold>[11] your father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s nakedness</bold> Some people say that this denotes a full sister, who is both his father&#x2019;s daughter and his mother&#x2019;s daughter. We consequently infer that whoever has relations with a full sister violates <italic>two</italic> prohibitions. Others assert that this verse merely strengthens the existing prohibition.<sup><xref rid="fn367">1</xref></sup> Probably the phrase <bold>your father&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter</bold> denotes a daughter born of rape.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348"><bold>[12]</bold> The word <bold>kin</bold> and the word &#x201C;flesh&#x201D; are closely related in meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn349"><bold>[14] she is your aunt</bold> You are to consider her your aunt, although she is not a blood relative (compare &#x201C;my uncle &#x1E24;anam&#x2019;el&#x201D; [Jeremiah 32:12], although &#x1E24;anam&#x2019;el was not technically Jeremiah&#x2019;s uncle). &#x00B6;What will they do who derive their Commandments from the written Torah alone? Scripture does not explicitly prohibit sexual relations with the mother&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s wife, nor with the paternal grandmother, nor with the maternal grandmother. Consequently, we need the Oral Tradition (possibly Scripture does not mention a mother&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s wife because we can generalize from the case of the father&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s wife, and also because it is alluded to in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Qedoshim</italic> [20:20]; the two other abovementioned relations are not mentioned, because Scripture deals only with behaviors that are known to occur).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350"><bold>[16] your brother&#x2019;s wife</bold> See also the passage, &#x201C;When brothers live&#x2026;&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 25:5].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351"><bold>[17]</bold> Should you ask why relations with a daughter are nowhere explicitly prohibited, the answer is that such a prohibition is implied by the ban against sexual relations with <bold>a woman and her daughter</bold>. After you have slept with a woman, her daughter is forbidden to you, regardless of whether or not she is also <italic>your</italic> daughter [the <italic>halakha</italic> [Yevamot 97a] is that one&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;s daughter is forbidden, but not the daughter of a woman with whom one has had extramarital relations &#x2014; Translator]. <bold>kin</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>sha&#x2019;ra</italic>] Hebrew contains two synonyms: <italic>sh&#x2019;er</italic> [:6] and <italic>sha&#x2019;ra</italic>. The <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> in <italic>sha&#x2019;ra</italic> would be vocalized with a schwa (like the <italic>lamed</italic> in &#x201C;garment&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>salma</italic>] [Exodus 22:8]) if it were not a guttural consonant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352"><bold>[18] to rival</bold> a fellow wife, in the sense of &#x201C;her rival provoked her&#x201D; [I Samuel 1:6]. The upcoming <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Qedoshim</italic> does not mention the punishment for having sexual relations with two sisters, just as it does not mention the punishment for sexual relations with a granddaughter. The commentator erred who said that Ra&#x1E25;el and Leah could not have been actual sisters, on the grounds that all human beings are alike forbidden to commit incest. You may ask, &#x201C;How can GOD punish someone for committing crimes about which he was not warned?&#x201D; &#x2014; but he would answer that the descendants of Noa&#x1E25; <italic>were</italic> commanded not to engage in any of the incestuous practices listed here. His evidence is the phrase &#x201C;all these abominations&#x201D; [:27], which implies that non-Jews are held accountable for all of the abovementioned prohibitions. As others have already pointed out, however, this evidence is not conclusive. Scripture uses the phrase &#x201C;all these abominations&#x201D; in a general way, to denote <italic>most</italic> of these abominations &#x2014; not literally <italic>all</italic> of them. You will come to know my own opinion on these matters in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Vayyelekh</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 31:16].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353"><bold>[19]</bold> Sexual relations with a menstruant are a more serious offense than incest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn354"><bold>[20]</bold> Some people say that Scripture has already prohibited <bold>your fellowman&#x2019;s wife</bold> [Exodus 20:13]; but this specification is needed, to exclude a woman captured in war. The word <bold>for seed</bold> has been misinterpreted by people whose passions overpowered their reason. We can divide sexuality into three components:</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) procreation, without physical desire;</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) to restore health and physical equilibrium; and</p>
<p align="blockquote">3) sheer animal lust.</p>
<p>Scripture uses the word <bold>for seed</bold> to say that even if your intention is solely to raise progeny, relations with a married woman are still strictly forbidden (the subsequent verse, &#x201C;Of your seed&#x2026;&#x201D; [:21], shows that &#x201C;seed&#x201D; means &#x201C;progeny&#x201D; in this context). Scripture goes on to say <bold>to be defiled through her</bold>, for whoever touches a married woman shall not become clean, but shall be forever defiled.</p>
<ftnote id="fn355"><bold>[21]</bold> This verse does not apply to one&#x2019;s children through a non-Jewish woman (this is irrelevant to the case of a female war captive, if she converts to Judaism). <bold>Molekh</bold> the name of an idol. Our Sages, of blessed memory, have interpreted this word [Sanhedrin 64a] as a general term for anything that someone may set on a throne [Hebrew: <italic>yamlikh</italic>] to rule over him. In all likelihood, however, it is also the name of a specific Ammonite abomination [I Kings 11:7]. <bold>to hand over</bold> meaning, to burn &#x2014; for this was the manner of its worship. Others say that the child was passed over a fire: some survived, and others died. Still others point out that the verse nowhere mentions fire, and that the commandment is not to hand a child over from the teachings of GOD into the worship of Molekh. By handing over the offspring of the holy nation to Molekh, you thereby desecrate <bold>the Name</bold> of your God, Who has called you into His service. &#x00B6;Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon classified the sexual crimes into eight levels of vileness [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 20:13]. Worst of all is intercourse with a beast, because that involves an entirely different species. The next level of severity is intercourse with another man, because the entire gender is forbidden. A lower level of severity is intercourse with one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s wife, and similar relations who are always forbidden. I shall not belabor the point, because these classifications are not practically useful, insofar as all sexual offenses are punishable by <italic>karet</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn356"><bold>[22] with a man</bold> We have seen from the verse &#x201C;I have lain with my father last night&#x201D; [Genesis 19:34] that the verb &#x201C;to lie&#x201D; may be used both by men and by women to denote sexual intercourse. Thus, this commandment applies equally to a pederast and to a catamite. The phrase <bold>coition with a woman</bold> [literally: coitions with a woman] has caused a great deal of trouble, on account of the plural noun. Rabbi &#x1E24;anan&#x2019;el ben &#x1E24;ushi&#x2019;el, may he rest in peace, said that there are men who graft something on to their bodies which has the appearance of the female organ. Others speak of a hermaphrodite. One person claims that Scripture here alludes to the two different ways one may have intercourse with a woman; therefore, homosexual intercourse is forbidden, whether it is done the standard way, or a nonstandard way. The truth is, in my opinion, that the commandment is to be understood simply and literally. The Hebrew word &#x201C;coition&#x201D; sometimes means &#x201C;ejaculation&#x201D;; this is why the word <bold>coitions</bold> appears in the plural. The Sages have declared that homosexual intercourse, like the other sexual crimes, is punishable by death [Yevamot 83b]. <bold>Do not lie</bold> Scripture speaks delicately, as in the phrase &#x201C;Do not draw near&#x201D; [:19]. Since Man was designed to be dominant, and Woman was designed to be submissive, Scripture warns us not to reverse the will of GOD. To dwell on this subject any further is distasteful. <bold>It is an abomination</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>to&#x2018;eva</italic>] something which is naturally abhorred [Hebrew: <italic>nit&#x2018;av</italic>] by a refined spirit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn357"><bold>[23] any beast</bold> i.e., a female beast. I have already translated the word <bold>your ejaculation</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>skhovtkha</italic>] [<italic>comment on</italic> :22]; it is probably related to the word &#x201C;lying down&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>skhiva</italic>], because an emission typically occurs only after lying down. <bold>to become defiled thereby</bold> Scripture uses the same phrase concerning a married woman [:20] as it uses here concerning a beast. <bold>before a beast</bold> i.e., a male beast. <bold>to mount her</bold> the subject of this verb is the abovementioned beast: the woman is mounted upon, the object of the verb. The word is related to the Hebrew word for &#x201C;four-legged&#x201D;. <bold>It is a destructive perversion</bold> The grammarians have classified this word as an &#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin word (like &#x201C;the vanishing track of a snail&#x201D; [Psalms 58:9]) with a superfluous <italic>tav</italic>. Thus it denotes destruction. Others assert that &#x201C;flood&#x201D; comes from the same root. It is related to the verb in &#x201C;GOD confused the language of the whole Earth&#x201D; [Genesis 11:9]. &#x00B6;In summary, Scripture mentions every category of creature that a man might encounter sexually, ranging from normal temptations like a married woman or a Gentile, all the way to a creature with which one cannot even have children (for an animal can mate successfully only with a member of its own species).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn358"><bold>[24] Do not contaminate yourselves</bold> The <italic>&#x1E6D;et</italic> acquires a <italic>dagesh</italic> because it absorbs the <italic>tav</italic> of the <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> (the fact that the <italic>mem</italic> has a <italic>dagesh</italic>, in accordance with the rule for a <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> verb, indicates that the letter which the <italic>&#x1E6D;et</italic> absorbed was <italic>not</italic> the <italic>nun</italic> of a <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> verb). Scripture tells us that all of the abovementioned activities defile the soul. <bold>I send away</bold> they will either die, or be expelled <bold>before you</bold> not on your account, but on account of the holiness of the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn359"><bold>[25] the land vomited</bold> Whatever a man vomits is repugnant in his sight, and he does not return to it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn360"><bold>[26] observe My decrees</bold> the abovementioned things which I have forbidden to you <bold>and my judgments</bold> you must render the justice that I demand, if anyone should disobey these laws. <bold>Do not practice any of these abominations</bold> Scripture repeats this admonition, in order to include <bold>the alien</bold>. These commandments apply equally to the native and to the resident alien, since both reside in the Holy Land. If you have sense in your head you shall understand that Ya&#x2018;aqov (who in his day married two sisters in &#x1E24;aran), and <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Amram after him (who married his aunt in Egypt), were not defiled by their actions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn361"><bold>[27] all these abominations</bold> Both you and your descendants must realize this, so that you will keep the law, and the land will remain pure &#x2014; otherwise, the land will vomit you out. <bold>these</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>ha&#x2019;el</italic>] This word means the same as <italic>ha&#x2019;elleh</italic> (compare, &#x201C;those&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>hahem</italic>] [Genesis 6:4] and &#x201C;those&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>hahemma</italic>] [Numbers 9:7]). However, Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon disagrees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn362"><bold>[28] it vomited</bold> either</ftnote>
<ul>
<li>The verb is in the past tense, third person masculine singular, from the root q-&#x2019;-h, as in &#x201C;Drink, become drunk, and vomit&#x201D; [Jeremiah 25:27] &#x2014; the latter word also stems from q-&#x2019;-h, as the four letters <italic>&#x2019;alef, heh, vav</italic>, and <italic>yod</italic> often interchange with one another. We see elsewhere that the word &#x201C;land&#x201D; sometimes assumes the masculine gender, as in &#x201C;the land is darkened&#x201D; [Isaiah 9:18] and &#x201C;the land was not able to support them&#x201D; [Genesis 13:6].</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>The verb is in the present tense, third person feminine singular, from the root q-v-&#x2019;, as in the similar <italic>&#x2018;ayin-vav</italic> verb &#x201C;approaching with the sheep&#x201D; [Genesis 29:6] (normally, a shift into the present tense would be indicated by inserting a pronoun, so as to read &#x201C;&#x2026;as <italic>she</italic> is now vomiting out&#x2026;&#x201D;).</li>
</ul>
<ftnote id="fn363"><bold>[29] the participating persons will be cut out</bold> If they act in public, you shall execute them; if they act in private, I shall cut them off Myself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn364"><bold>[30] Observe My charge</bold> This constitutes the charge: that you <bold>prevent yourselves from practicing</bold> etc. <bold>which were practiced before you</bold> A man must not say, &#x201C;Since the ancients acted thus, I shall act this way also.&#x201D; <bold>I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold> This relates to the previous phrase, <bold>observe My charge</bold>. A skeptic should not ask, &#x201C;What is this charge for?&#x201D; &#x2014; for <bold>I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God;</bold> and you shall do all that I command you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn365"><sup>1</sup>[The identity of this scholar is uncertain, but is probably either Gaon Mevasser ben Kahana Kimai or Gaon Shmu&#x2019;el ben &#x1E24;ofni &#x2014; Translator]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn366"><sup>1</sup>All birds of prey are ritually impure [&#x1E24;ullin 59a].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367"><sup>1</sup>The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] said that this verse does not denote his mother&#x2019;s daughter. They interpret the qualifier <bold>born of your father</bold> to mean that his father <italic>raised</italic> her. The case involves a father who married a woman who already had a small child. They explain the case of Tamar [II Samuel 13:1] similarly. Their evidence is the phrase &#x201C;for he will not withhold me from you&#x201D; [II Samuel 13:13] which shows that David did <italic>not</italic> raise her. Since the Exegetes have said that it is permitted to marry one&#x2019;s stepsister [So&#x1E6D;a 43b], there is no need to reply to these fabricators.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn368"><bold>[19:2] The entire community of the Children of Israel</bold> means that the resident alien is not included. Like the Israelites, resident aliens were told not to commit any sexual offenses; therefore they must now be specifically excluded from most of the subsequent commandments. However, Scripture mentions the current passage immediately after the passage dealing with sexual offenses, so that one should not think that resident aliens may remain in the land, if they refrain <italic>only</italic> from sexual crimes. In fact, there are other commandments which they must follow in order not to be expelled from the land: i.e., the Ten Commandments which are herein mentioned. <bold>&#x00B6;Be holy</bold> This is the prohibition against idolatry. It is given on account of the fact that <bold>I</bold>, GOD <bold>your God, am holy</bold> (which corresponds to the utterance that most people count as the First Commandment). &#x201C;Do not swear by My name&#x2026;&#x201D; [:12] corresponds to the Commandment &#x201C;You shall not swear&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 20:7].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn369"><bold>[3] You will observe My Sabbaths</bold> corresponds to &#x201C;Remember the Sabbath day&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 20:8]; <bold>Each of you will revere his mother and father</bold> corresponds to &#x201C;Honor your father and your mother&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 20:12]; and &#x201C;Do not stand idle when your fellowman is in danger&#x201D; [:16] corresponds to the Commandment &#x201C;You shall not murder&#x201D; [Exodus 20:13]. The passage of the betrothed bondmaid [:20] warns us not to commit adultery with a free-woman. &#x201C;Do not steal; do not deny; do not lie&#x201D; [:11] and &#x201C;Do not exploit your neighbor&#x201D; [:13] correspond to the three remaining Commandments. I have already told you in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Mishpa&#x1E6D;im</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 21:2] that every commandment is self-contained, but that nevertheless, there are associations among the commandments that account for their juxtaposition in the verses. The <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Qedoshim</italic> begins with the commandment, <bold>each of you will revere</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>his mother and father</bold>. Scripture has already said [Exodus 20:12] that whoever <italic>honors</italic> his parents will enjoy long life; consequently, whoever <italic>dishonors</italic> his parents shortens his life, and Scripture accordingly tells us to fear our parents as well as to honor them. The verse mentions the mother before mentioning the father, because a child at first recognizes only his mother. Later, he recognizes his father. Afterwards he recognizes the Sabbath (it is incumbent upon a child to observe the Sabbath, unlike the remaining festivals). Eventually he will come to recognize his God, Who rested on the seventh day. The next logical obligation is &#x201C;Do not turn to the idols&#x201D; [:4]. We know from tradition what constitutes &#x201C;reverence&#x201D; of one&#x2019;s parents. Scripture employs brevity by using only one instance of the word <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic> to signify <bold>Each of you</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;ish &#x2019;ish</italic>]. The plural form of the verb <bold>revere</bold> informs us that anyone who sees the law being broken must teach and compel the lawbreaker to change. The same principle applies to keeping the Sabbath, since the plural form <bold>you shall observe</bold> is used. <bold>I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold> You shall do as I do, Who rested from all labor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn370"><bold>[4] Do not turn</bold> Do not even direct your attention to them by looking at them. <bold>idols</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;elilim</italic>] i.e., graven images. They are called <italic>&#x2019;elilim</italic> because they are false, as in &#x201C;you are all physicians of no value [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;elil</italic>]&#x201D; [Job 13:4]. It is also plausible that the word comes from <italic>&#x2019;el</italic>, meaning something that lacks substance. <bold>molten images</bold> which supposedly receive their power from the heavens. There is no need for any God other than Me; therefore Scripture states, <bold>I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold>. The verb <bold>turn</bold> is in plural form, as is the verb <bold>make</bold>, to teach us that whoever sees such a thing, and does not reveal it, is considered an accomplice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn371"><bold>[5] If you sacrifice a peace-offering</bold> This is connected to the previous verse: They shall not offer sacrifices to the demons, who are false gods, but rather shall offer sacrifices only to GOD. The verb <bold>sacrifice</bold> is in plural form, because Scripture speaks of the most common case, when several people join together to offer a single sacrifice. <bold>of your own free will</bold> They should bring the sacrifice willingly, and not out of compulsion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn372"><bold>[8] Whoever eats</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>will suffer</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] Each one of the people who eat it, as in &#x201C;The righteous [<italic>plural</italic>] are secure [<italic>singular</italic>] like a lion&#x201D; [Proverbs 28:1] [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 7:10]. <bold>he has desecrated what</bold> GOD <bold>has sanctified</bold> Once he has offered the sacrifice to the Most High, all of its flesh is holy. The word <bold>desecrated</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;illel</italic>] is related to &#x201C;secular&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;ol</italic>]. This verse specifies the punishment for a commandment which has already appeared [7:18] &#x2014; namely, <bold>that person will be cut off</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn373"><bold>[9]</bold> The reason for mentioning <bold>When you reap&#x2026;</bold> after mentioning the peace-offering, is that we must allocate our harvest the same way we allocate the sacrificial portions of a peace-offering: for the glory of GOD, for the poor, and for the alien. The word <bold>When you reap</bold> is grammatically bizarre, because it is a verbal noun derived from the <italic>qal</italic> form [and the <italic>qof</italic> should be vocalized with a <italic>qama&#x1E63; qa&#x1E6D;an</italic>]. <bold>the corner of your field</bold> One must leave <italic>one</italic> corner of the field unharvested. <bold>individual stalks</bold> This word has a precise meaning [Pe&#x2019;a 6:5].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn374"><bold>[10] do not glean</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>t&#x2018;olel</italic>] <bold>your vineyard</bold> Do not obliterate the <italic>&#x2018;olelot</italic>, the young, immature grapes (from the word &#x201C;child&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;olel</italic>] [Jeremiah 44:7]), sometimes called the &#x201C;sucklings&#x201D;. This is a denominalized verb, as in &#x201C;root you out of the land of the living&#x201D; [Psalms 52:7] (meaning, he will destroy the roots), and &#x201C;branches the bough&#x201D; [Isaiah 10:33] (meaning, he will destroy the branch).<sup><xref rid="fn428">1</xref></sup> <bold>fallen grapes</bold> This term is known from tradition [Pe&#x2019;a 7:3]. It is related to &#x201C;pluck the strings of the lute&#x201D; [Amos 6:5]. <bold>for the poor</bold> of Israel <bold>and for the alien</bold> &#x201C;who dwell among you&#x201D; &#x2014; i.e., the converts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375"><bold>[11] Do not steal</bold> follows the previous verse, in order to say: Since I have commanded you, for the glory of GOD, to give your own possessions to the poor, certainly you must not take someone else&#x2019;s possessions&#x0021; The plural form of the verb <bold>Do not steal</bold> teaches us that whoever witnesses a theft, and remains silent, is also considered a thief. <bold>Do not deny</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] regarding a deposit entrusted to you; and whoever knows the truth but does not testify is also guilty of denial. <bold>do not lie</bold> by demanding money from someone who does not owe you anything.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376"><bold>[12] Do not swear by My Name falsely</bold> appears after &#x201C;Do not steal&#x2026;&#x201D;, for someone who is accused of stealing, or of denying a deposit, must take an oath. Scripture uses the plural form of the verb, to include as well anyone who induces another to swear falsely. <bold>desecrate</bold> Whoever swears falsely denies GOD, as I have explained [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 20:7].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377"><bold>[13] Do not exploit your neighbor</bold> covertly <bold>and do not rob</bold> overtly, by force of arms <bold>hire</bold> i.e., wages, as in &#x201C;his hire is before him&#x201D; [Isaiah 40:10]. Most likely the word&#x2019;s origin is elliptical, from &#x201C;(the reward of someone&#x2019;s) hire&#x201D;. Many people apply this verse to the case of a day laborer. One must not say, &#x201C;Come and do the same work tomorrow <bold>morning</bold>, and in the morning I shall give you two days&#x2019; wages.&#x201D; The Exegetes have demonstrated [Bava M<sup>&#x0259;</sup>&#x1E63;i&#x2018;a 110b] that this verse discusses a day laborer, because elsewhere Scripture says, &#x201C;before the sun sets&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 24:15] concerning a night laborer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378"><bold>[14] Do not curse</bold> [even] <bold>the deaf</bold>, although you may have the power to do so with impunity. Similarly, do not place a stumbling block <bold>before the blind. Revere your God</bold> Who can punish you, although your victims cannot, and can strike you deaf or blind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379"><bold>[15] Do not pervert justice</bold> This commandment is directed to judges and witnesses. <bold>a great man</bold> here denotes a wealthy man (<italic>cf</italic>. the description of Barzillai [II Samuel 19:33]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn380"><bold>[16] a talebearer</bold> from the word &#x201C;your merchandise&#x201D; [Ezekiel 28:16] and also &#x201C;&#x2026;with all powders of the merchant&#x201D; [Song of Songs 3:6]. Here the word denotes a gossiper. Just as a merchant transmits things, buying them here and selling them there, so also does a gossiper transmit things, revealing to one what he heard from another. <bold>Do not stand idle when your fellowman is in danger</bold> [literally: Do not stand upon your fellowman&#x2019;s blood] One must not become involved with men who shed blood. It is well known that many people have been murdered, many people have been killed, because of slander. Doeg the Edomite is a prime example [I Samuel 22:9&#x2013;19]. <bold>I am</bold> GOD Who sees all that you do in private.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn381"><bold>[17] Do not hate your brother</bold> This is the negative aspect of &#x201C;love your fellowman as yourself&#x201D; [:18]. Although these commandments all involve a person&#x2019;s private emotions, only through their observance will Israel be permitted to remain on its land (The Second Temple was destroyed because of groundless hatred [Yoma 9b]). Perhaps you hate someone because you suspect him of something which never happened; therefore, <bold>reprove your fellowman</bold>. On the other hand, perhaps he actually did something which calls for reproof. In that case, <bold>do not bear sin because of him;</bold> because if you do not correct him, you might be punished on his account.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn382"><bold>[18] Do not take vengeance, and do not bear a grudge</bold> These terms are defined in the writings of our Sages [e.g., Yoma 23a]. <bold>love to your fellowman as yourself</bold> Many people have said that the <italic>lamed</italic> is superfluous, like the <italic>lamed</italic> in &#x201C;they killed <sup>&#x2283;</sup>Avner&#x201D; [II Samuel 3:30] [literally: they killed <italic>to</italic> <sup>&#x2283;</sup>Avner]. In my opinion, however, it contributes to the verse&#x2019;s meaning. One must love the good that pertains <italic>to</italic> one&#x2019;s fellowman as much as one loves the good that pertains <italic>to</italic> oneself. <bold>I am</bold> GOD means: I, a single God, have created all of you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn383"><bold>[19]</bold> The reason for mentioning <bold>Do not interbreed different kinds of animals</bold> after the previous commandments, is to say to us: Just as the requirement to be holy implies that you must not do violence to other human beings, so also it implies that you must not do anything to animals which alters the work of GOD. This is why Scripture says, <bold>Preserve My decrees:</bold> you must <italic>preserve</italic> each species, and not interbreed one species with another. <bold>intermingled</bold> composed of two species. Later, I shall explain this word more fully. Not to intermingle even a field or a garment serves as a reminder. There are many commandments that are primarily reminders: e.g., the Festivals of Ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot [Deuteronomy 16:3] and of Sukkot [23:43]; wearing <italic>&#x1E63;i&#x1E63;it</italic> [Numbers 15:40]; hearing the <italic>shofar</italic> [Numbers 10:10]; affixing a <italic>m<sup>&#x0259;</sup>zuza</italic>; and wearing <italic>t<sup>&#x0259;</sup>fillin</italic> [Exodus 13:9]. I shall now reveal a little-known principle: Whoever is complete in his intellectual understanding is necessarily also complete in his religious observance. Thus, Scripture says regarding Abraham that &#x201C;he kept My observances, My moral decrees, My authoritative decrees, and My laws&#x201D; [Genesis 26:5]. <bold>wool-and-linen</bold> mixed together. This word is unique in Scripture. The Exegetes have said [Kil&#x2019;ayyim 9:8] that it is a compound word, formed from three smaller words. It may also stem from a five-letter root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn384"><bold>[20] a bondmaid</bold> The Exegetes have asserted that this woman is not Jewish. Otherwise, a literal interpretation of this verse would identify her with the Israelite woman who is discussed in the passage &#x201C;When a man sells his daughter to be a maid-servant&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 21:7]. In both cases, the woman has been designated eventually to marry her master, or her master&#x2019;s son, but she is not formally engaged. This is the meaning of <bold>she was not free</bold> &#x2014; for she does not become completely free until she receives a proper betrothal. <bold>subservient</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>ne&#x1E25;erefet</italic>] Most people render this word as &#x201C;designated to&#x201D;; but in my opinion, the word comes from &#x201C;shame&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;erpa</italic>]. She is ashamed because she is a bondmaid, and because she is an unbetrothed virgin living in someone else&#x2019;s household. <bold>redeemed</bold> a verbal noun from the passive, <italic>hof&#x2018;al</italic> form. Neither her father nor any other relative redeemed her before she became of age. <bold>her freedom</bold> The word is vocalized with a <italic>shuruq</italic>. Normally, a <italic>qama&#x1E63; qa&#x1E6D;an</italic> would be expected, because the base noun is pronounced <italic>&#x1E25;ofesh</italic>, vocalized with a <italic>&#x1E25;olem</italic>. It was conventional to write the girl a bill of manumission [and to marry her &#x2014; Translator] before a fixed amount of time had elapsed, if her father sold her into slavery [Bekhorot 13a]. The Exegetes said [Karetot 11a; Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in 43b] that the verse discusses a woman who is half free and half slave; and their words are true. <bold>lashes</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>biqqoret</italic>] Some people interpret the word to mean &#x201C;concubine&#x201D;, claiming that the word is related to &#x201C;king&#x2019;s daughters were among your honorable ones&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>biqqrotekha</italic>] [Psalms 45:10]. This interpretation is incorrect, as <italic>biqqrotekha</italic> denotes &#x201C;the <italic>valuable</italic> maidservants&#x201D;. The <italic>yod</italic> of the triliteral root y-q-r disappears, because the preposition which precedes it is vocalized with a <italic>&#x1E25;iriq</italic> (otherwise, the word would contain two adjacent voiced schwas &#x2014; one underneath the preposition, and one underneath the first root-letter &#x2014; and the Hebrew language does not tolerate such a combination). This rule is obeyed everywhere.<sup><xref rid="fn429">1</xref></sup> Others say that <italic>biqqoret</italic> comes from &#x201C;the kohen will not seek&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>yevaqqer</italic>] [13:36], meaning, to search for something. The Exegetes have said that she is flogged with a strap made of cowhide [Hebrew: <italic>baqar</italic>]. Although this is true on the basis of tradition, the etymology is only a mnemonic. The reason this commandment is mentioned in the current passage is that whoever disobeys it cheats the bondmaid&#x2019;s owner. That is why</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn385"><bold>[21]</bold> he must bring a ram guilt-offering. Another, more figurative, explanation is that this act of sexual intercourse is also a kind of intermixture &#x2014; a mixing of freeman and slavewoman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn386"><bold>[22] he will be forgiven</bold> I will explain this later at greater length [<italic>comment on</italic> Numbers 14:19].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn387"><bold>[23]</bold> Having mentioned the sowing of crops [:19], and the sowing of a woman [:20] (who is analogous to the soil), Scripture proceeds to things that are planted, and discusses the forbidden fruits. It is well known that fruit which grows on trees less than three years old is harmful and contains no nutrition (just as fish that do not have fins and scales are harmful, and meat from birds of prey and from the non-kosher beasts is detrimental to the intelligence &#x2014; <italic>verbum sat sapienti</italic>). <bold>you will leave its fruit unused</bold> [literally: you shall regard the fruit as uncircumcised] You shall treat it as you treat a foreskin, which is harmful and serves no purpose (linguistically, a foreskin [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;orla</italic>] is an &#x201C;impediment&#x201D; of the flesh, like a speech impediment [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;orla</italic>], or a hearing impediment [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;orla</italic>]). <bold>unused</bold> Literally means to treat something as an <italic>&#x2018;orla</italic>; but the Aramaic translation is also worthy of note [&#x201C;You shall put it aside for destruction&#x201D;]. <bold>it will be forbidden</bold> as a consequence of having regarded it as uncircumcised.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn388"><bold>[24] praisegiving</bold> In order to praise GOD. This fruit must be eaten by the kohanim.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389"><bold>[25] increase its produce</bold> This is a continuation of the previous verse: The fruit is designated for praisegiving, because He shall <bold>increase its produce</bold>. Although the two parts of the sentence are far removed from one another, there are other places in Scripture also where intervening phrases break the syntax of a connected idea. To pick one example out of many: &#x201C;He must make restitution; if he has nothing wherewith to pay&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 22:2] is a displaced continuation of the verse &#x201C;he shall pay five oxen for every ox&#x2026;&#x201D; [Exodus 21:37]. <bold>I am</bold> GOD i.e., I am capable of increasing My blessing over your crops.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn390"><bold>[26] Do not eat on blood</bold> This commandment (which prohibits eating meat from any of the permitted species of animals until its blood is dashed upon the Altar of GOD) logically follows the previous one (which prohibits eating fruit from a domesticated tree until the fifth year). It applies only in the vicinity of the Sanctuary, and this is borne out by Sha<sup>&#x2283;</sup>ul&#x2019;s words [I Samuel 14:34], for he had the Ark with him [I Samuel 14:18]. By saying [I Samuel 14:33] that they were &#x201C;eating on blood&#x201D;, it is as if Scripture accused them of eating sacrifices to the satyrs. As I have explained, it was an Egyptian custom to offer sacrifices to demons; and if one has not dashed the blood against the Altar in the name of GOD, it is apparent that one is eating in the name of demons. For this reason the commandment is juxtaposed to <bold>Do not believe in omens:</bold> The Egyptians used to eat on blood, and stray after the demons; the Canaanites used to believe in omens, and in propitious times (as it is written [Deuteronomy 18:14]). Once again Scripture associates Egyptian and Canaanite practices, as expressed earlier by &#x201C;the deeds of the land of Egypt&#x2026;the deeds of the land of Canaan&#x201D; [18:3]. People look for omens to test things about which they are uncertain, as in &#x201C;I have tested you by divination, and have established that GOD has blessed me&#x2026;&#x201D; [Genesis 30:27]. Shapes, special rods, unusual events, and arbitrary movements have all been used as omens, as well as days of the year or hours of the day. <bold>Do not believe in auspicious times</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>lo t&#x2018;onenu</italic>] Some people say that this word comes from &#x201C;answer&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;ana</italic>]: one concentrates on some particular question, and listens carefully to something to hear how he will be answered. This etymology is grammatically unacceptable. Other people relate the word to &#x201C;her scheduled times&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;onatah</italic>] [Exodus 21:10]. In my opinion the word derives from &#x201C;cloud&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;anan</italic>]. It is well known that people perform divination on clouds, by observing their shapes and their movements. The word is most likely an <italic>&#x2018;ayin- &#x2018;ayin</italic> verb (as in &#x201C;to turn&#x201D; [Hebrew: s-b-b]). Here the verb is in the <italic>polel</italic> form. It appears in the <italic>qal</italic> form in &#x201C;soothsayers like the Philistines&#x201D; [Isaiah 2:6]. A clearer example is found in &#x201C;a diviner of auspicious times, or a diviner of omens&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 18:10].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn391"><bold>[27]</bold> At this point Scripture mentions <bold>Do not cut off the hair on the corners of your head</bold> because this too was the practice of the other nations; and we must separate ourselves from them. Moreover, the hair on the head and the beard were created for beauty, and it is inappropriate to destroy it. Some people suggest that this verse precedes</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn392"><bold>[28] Do not make any incision in your flesh</bold> because it was a sign of mourning to cut off the hair on the corners of the head, or on the corners of the beard. <bold>incision</bold> The meaning of this word, like that of the abovementioned &#x201C;corners&#x201D; of the head and of the beard, is known to us through tradition [Makkot 20b]. <bold>for the soul</bold> here denotes a dead body (as it is correctly rendered in the Aramaic translation). The <italic>nun</italic> is not doubled with a <italic>dagesh</italic> for the sake of ease of pronunciation. <bold>tattoo marks</bold> Some say that this commandment is connected to the previously-mentioned <bold>incision</bold> because there are people who tattoo themselves as a sign of mourning, using fire to brand their body with specific shapes. Nowadays, also, people mark their faces when they are young in order to distinguish themselves. The word <bold>tattoo</bold> is doubled, like &#x201C;and that which comes out of it&#x201D; [Isaiah 42:5]. It comes from &#x201C;and have them impale&#x201D; [Numbers 25:4]. The opinion of the Aramaic translator, however, seems to be that the word has no cognate, and this too is plausible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn393"><bold>[29]</bold> After discussing gashes in the skin for the dead, Scripture now mentions <bold>Do not desecrate your daughter</bold>, because she must not be uncovered in public. Even a woman&#x2019;s voice is indecent [Berakhot 24a] &#x2014; how much more so, incisions in her flesh. <bold>You will then not make the land sexually immoral</bold> Scripture employs metonymy, and means sexual immorality among the <italic>inhabitants</italic> of the land. Compare, &#x201C;when the land sins against me&#x201D; [Ezekiel 14:12].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn394"><bold>[30]</bold> The injunction to <bold>observe My Sabbaths</bold> appears next, after mentioning the dead &#x2014; to remind us that there is no mourning on the Sabbath. However, the principle of <bold>revere My sanctuary</bold> applies to the High Priest, who must not behave like other mourners (this warning extends to all people associated with the Sanctuary). <bold>I am</bold> GOD that is to say, those who do not revere My Sanctuary, and honor it, shall be punished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn395"><bold>[31]</bold> Having brought up the dead, Scripture now mentions <bold>charmers and wizards</bold>, since they purport to communicate with the dead (as it is written in Isaiah, &#x201C;[seek guidance] of the dead on behalf of the living&#x201D; [Isaiah 8:19]). <bold>charmers</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;ovot</italic>] as in &#x201C;jugs&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2019;ovot</italic>] [Job 32:19] &#x2014; this being a major tool of their trade. <bold>wizards</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>yidd&#x2018;onim</italic>], from &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>da&#x2018;at</italic>]. They seek knowledge of the future. Certain empty-headed people have asserted that Scripture would not have forbidden charmers as a form of witchcraft if they were not true. I declare the exact opposite of their words: Scripture has forbidden only that which is false, but has not forbidden the truth. This is borne out by the prohibitions against idols and graven images. Were it not for my unwillingness to enter into a digression, I could elucidate definitive proofs against this practice. <bold>Do not turn</bold> to learn the art. <bold>Do not seek</bold> to request their services (as Saul did [I Samuel 28:8]). <bold>I am</bold> GOD <bold>your God</bold> You must seek out GOD alone. That is why Scripture uses the phrase <bold>defiled by them:</bold> anyone who turns to or who seeks out these forms of magic defiles his soul, because he detaches himself from GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396"><bold>[32]</bold> After discussing the dead, Scripture says <bold>Stand up for the elderly</bold>, for an aged man is close to death, and his body is already considered dead. This commandment includes every old person and every person with white hair [Qiddushin 32b]. <bold>Revere your God</bold> Who can punish you in your old age.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397"><bold>[33] If a convert dwells with you</bold> is mentioned after the elderly. Just as Scripture has admonished you to honor an elderly Israelite though he has no power, so does it admonish you regarding a convert, who also has little power compared to you (perhaps he is considered powerless simply because he resides in your land, under your dominion).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn398"><bold>[34] you will love to him</bold> already explained [<italic>comment on</italic> :18].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn399"><bold>[35] Do not act dishonestly</bold> mentioned here on account of the convert &#x2014; as in, &#x201C;execute justice between a man and his neighbor, and even a convert&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 1:16]. Similarly, do not act deceitfully when you measure length. This clearly implies, since the units of length differ from place to place, that you must deal in terms that are commonly used in your location.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400"><bold>[36] just scales, just stones</bold> an elaboration on measures of weight <bold>a just <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic></bold> a unit of dry measure <bold>a just <italic>hin</italic></bold> a unit of liquid measure &#x2014; these are both measures of volume. <bold>I am</bold> GOD, <bold>your God, Who took you out &#x2026;</bold> I have already reminded you that &#x201C;you were strangers in the land of Egypt&#x201D; [:34]; and consequently,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn401"><bold>[37]</bold> you must keep <bold>My decrees</bold> and <bold>My rational precepts</bold> in your hearts, and you must obey them in practice. <bold>I am</bold> GOD i.e., you must pursue the fulfillment of the precepts which I have given you, for they are entirely just.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402"><bold>[20:1]</bold> GOD <bold>told Moshe</bold> The preceding commandments are binding upon Israel, to the exclusion of the resident alien (which is why they were introduced by &#x201C;Tell the entire community of the [Children of] Israel&#x201D; [19:2]). Scripture is now about to describe punishments for sexual crimes, which are applicable to anyone who lives in the land of Israel &#x2014; native and alien alike.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403"><bold>[2] who gives any of his children to Molekh</bold> This is the gravest of all sexual crimes: to sleep with an idolater, and to father her children. Thus it is mentioned first. <bold>The people of the land</bold> The land where he dwells, whether as a native or as a foreigner. This punishment is imposed only if the crime was perpetrated in public. <bold>with a stone</bold> We might think that this is a collective noun, as in &#x201C;I have ox and donkey&#x201D; [Genesis 32:6]; however, the words of the tradition [Sanhedrin 45a] are true.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404"><bold>[3] I will turn My anger against that man</bold> if the crime was committed in secret. Some people say that this denotes destruction of his progeny. <bold>defiling My Sanctuary</bold> which resides in the land of Israel. <bold>desecrating My holy Name</bold> for the other nations will hear of it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405"><bold>[5]</bold> Rabbi Yona ibn Jana&#x1E25; has said that <bold>his family</bold> refers to the case when his family follows him into crime. What is the rabbi&#x2019;s problem? Clearly the plain and straightforward explanation is preferable: the inhabitants of the land might ignore his crime, because they are members of his family. <bold>and all who are deluded with him</bold> If he does not die, he will lead others astray.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406"><bold>[6] the person who turns to charmers</bold> Just as I shall destroy whoever gives his children to Molekh secretly &#x2014; or who does it in public, if the inhabitants of the land do not execute him &#x2014; so shall I destroy whoever strays away from Me and turns to <bold>charmers and wizards</bold>. The Hebrew word <italic>nefesh</italic> appears in the masculine plural in the phrase &#x201C;the people that you hunt&#x201D; [Ezekiel 13:20]; it is masculine singular in &#x201C;fourteen people in all&#x201D; [Genesis 46:22]. Similarly, here it is the masculine antecedent of the phrase <bold>I will cut him off.</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407"><bold>[7] Sanctify yourselves&#x2026;for I am</bold> GOD, <bold>your God</bold> Who am holy;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn408"><bold>[8]</bold> and I have given you decrees for you to keep, in order to make you holy. This idea was expressed earlier [11:44] and it is repeated here to include the foreigners who live among Israel. They must keep themselves holy, because they live in the Holy Land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn409"><bold>[9]</bold> Scripture now mentions the punishments for the crimes that were listed at the beginning of the <italic>parasha</italic>, starting with &#x201C;Each of you will be in awe of his mother and father&#x201D; [19:3]. Here the father is mentioned first, out of respect. <bold>Any man who curses his father and his mother</bold> Scripture employs ellipsis, and means &#x201C;Any man who curses his father, and any man who curses his mother&#x201D;. <bold>he cursed his father or his mother</bold> That is to say: He has done a horrible thing. <bold>he alone is to blame for his death</bold> [literally: his blood is with him] compare, &#x201C;his blood is on his head&#x201D; [Joshua 2:19]. The tradition which we have received from our ancestors, and upon which we rely, sees in this phrase an allusion to the form of execution which does not cause external bleeding &#x2014; i.e., stoning.<sup><xref rid="fn430">1</xref></sup> Without the tradition, we would not know how to go about executing someone. We would also not know how old a person must be to be responsible for his crimes, since Scripture does not say so explicitly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410"><bold>[10]</bold> The punishment for <bold>If a man commits adultery with a married woman</bold> is now mentioned (the prohibition has already been given [18:20]). <bold>He has committed adultery with his neighbor&#x2019;s wife</bold> The same device is used in the previous verse (&#x201C;He cursed his father or his mother&#x201D; [:9]) and in both cases the repetition means: He has done a horrible thing. &#x00B6;The woman is not called an <bold>adulteress</bold> if she was raped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn411"><bold>[11] he has uncovered his father&#x2019;s nakedness</bold> i.e., he has committed a serious crime.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412"><bold>[12] daughter-in-law</bold> This term denotes a son&#x2019;s wife. <bold>a destructive perversion</bold> I have already explained this word [<italic>comment on</italic> 18:23].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413"><bold>[13] they have committed</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>an abomination</bold> The plural form of the verb applies only if the catamite was not raped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414"><bold>[14] If a man marries a woman &#x2026; it is lewdness</bold> i.e., an incestuous act was contemplated. <bold>and them</bold> i.e., either one or the other. If the mother was his original wife, the daughter will be burnt, and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn415"><bold>[15] you shall kill the animal</bold> so that it not cause another person to sin. There are also some who say: in order to conceal the disgrace.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn416"><bold>[16] to perform bestiality</bold> This word is an infinitive, even though the first letter of the triliteral root is vocalized with a <italic>&#x1E25;iriq</italic> (compare, &#x201C;When I break off&#x201D; [26:26]). Verbal nouns in Hebrew assume various forms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn417"><bold>[17] If a man marries his sister</bold> Such a marriage must have been performed by people unaware of their relationship, which subsequently became known. <bold>and he saw her nakedness</bold> that is, &#x201C;<italic>or</italic> he sees &#x2026;&#x201D; (as in, &#x201C;he cursed his father, or his mother&#x201D; [:9]). In this context, the word <bold>saw</bold> is synonymous with &#x201C;uncovered&#x201D;. <bold>and she sees his nakedness</bold> thus the act occurred by mutual consent. <bold>a shameful perversion</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;esed</italic>] from &#x201C;lest the hearer put you to shame&#x201D; [Proverbs 25:10]. The word denotes an egregious sexual crime. <bold>He uncovered his sister&#x2019;s nakedness</bold> If he forced her, then <bold>he</bold> alone <bold>will bear his sin</bold>. &#x00B6;Scripture chooses to make the above points in the case of a brother and a sister because they grow up together, they play together when young, and frequently they are left alone together. Conversely, Scripture does not mention the punishment for sleeping with one&#x2019;s son&#x2019;s daughter or one&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s daughter, relegating it instead to the Oral Law, because a man is normally advanced in years and empty of desire by the time he has a mature granddaughter. For the same reason, Scripture does not mention the case of a father&#x2019;s mother or a mother&#x2019;s mother &#x2014; because they are old.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn418"><bold>[18] indisposed</bold> She is considered ill, because she loses blood. <bold>he has violated her womb</bold> that is, he has committed an abominable act. <bold>she has revealed</bold> voluntarily; but if she is forced, he alone will be cut off.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn419"><bold>[19]</bold> If you uncover <bold>your mother&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s nakedness</bold>, which I have already told you not to uncover [18:13], you fall into the category of one who has <bold>violated his near kin</bold>. If it was done deliberately, <bold>they shall bear their guilt</bold>. However, Scripture does not state the punishment for intercourse with one&#x2019;s aunt. Similarly, Scripture does not even mention that there <italic>is</italic> a punishment for intercourse with two sisters. A learned person will understand why [out of respect for <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Amram, who married his aunt, and for Ya&#x2018;aqov, who married two sisters &#x2014; Translator] [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> 18:26]. The words of the tradition are also true [Yevamot 3b].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn420"><bold>[20] his aunt</bold> In Hebrew, this word only denotes the wife of one&#x2019;s uncle. <bold>childless</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;aririm</italic>] The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] claim that this word is a synonym for &#x201C;naked&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;arumim</italic>] [Genesis 2:25] and that <bold>they will die</bold> means &#x201C;they will be executed&#x201D;; but they are wrong. The Aramaic translation is correct. I have elsewhere explained the phrase &#x201C;write this man childless&#x201D; [Jeremiah 22:30] along the lines of &#x201C;I remain childless&#x201D; [Genesis 15:2].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn421"><bold>[21]</bold> A brother&#x2019;s wife is said to be <bold>separated</bold>, i.e., it is proper to distance oneself from her (compare, &#x201C;your brethren that hated you, that cast you out&#x201D; [Isaiah 66:5]). Of all the prohibited sexual relations, this word is used only in connection with a brother&#x2019;s wife. Just as a woman enters her monthly period of separation, during which she is forbidden, and after which in time she becomes permitted, so also can a brother&#x2019;s wife become permitted (see my comment on the passage &#x201C;When brothers live together &#x2026;&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 25:5]). &#x00B6;Certain people have said that just as it is forbidden for a man to have relations with his father&#x2019;s sister, so it must be forbidden for a woman to marry her uncle. This reasoning is not valid. The prohibited relations are all specified from the man&#x2019;s point of view, because it is possible for a man to force sexual relations with someone else, whereas it is not possible for a woman to force sexual relations on a man. According to their line of reasoning, let them explain why we do not accept the testimony of two women&#x0021; Even if one follows the standard valuations [27:2], four female witnesses should be at least as good as two male witnesses. Accordingly, we require the tradition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn422"><bold>[22] You will observe all My decrees</bold> by abstaining from these incestuous relations. <bold>and all My precepts</bold> by carrying out the specified punishments. <bold>so that the land will not vomit</bold> I shall explain this in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Vayyelekh</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 31:16].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn423"><bold>[23] I abhorred them</bold> An anthropomorphism, as in &#x201C;His soul was disgusted&#x201D; [Judges 10:16].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn424"><bold>[24] a land flowing milk and honey</bold> There will be no land to resemble it. Just as <bold>I have distinguished you from the nations</bold> through these statutes,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425"><bold>[25]</bold> So must you distinguish among the animals. <bold>the ritually pure beast</bold> The ten enumerated animals [Deuteronomy 14:4] are kosher; all the others are unkosher. <bold>the ritually impure bird</bold> Any bird mentioned [11:13] is unkosher; all the others are kosher. <bold>to consider ritually impure</bold> i.e., you must know, in thought and in speech, that they are ritually impure. Compare, &#x201C;you shall consider detestable among the birds&#x201D; [11:13]. For this reason a resident alien may not eat an unkosher species of animal in the Holy Land &#x2014; and it is only on this condition that he may live among us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426"><bold>[26]</bold> If you observe everything I have commanded you, then you will become <bold>holy;</bold> for you are obliged to follow Me, and <bold>I am holy</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn427"><bold>[27]</bold> Previously, when charmers were mentioned, Scripture used the phrase &#x201C;to be defiled by them&#x201D; [19:31]. Now that Scripture tells us that we must be holy, we are told to execute anyone who defiles his soul through charming or through wizardry (up until now, the punishment for performing these practices in public was not specified). The case of a woman is singled out, because women are more involved in these professions than men are (compare, &#x201C;You shall not spare a witch&#x201D; [Exodus 22:17]).</ftnote>

It is a stoppage: You will do no servile work. <sup><xref rid="fn508">[37]</xref></sup>These are GOD&#x2019;s chosen times, which you will declare holy occasions; to bring a fire-offering to GOD: burnt-offerings, grain-offerings, sacrifices and libations, as required for each day; <sup><xref rid="fn509">[38]</xref></sup>besides the Sabbaths of GOD, besides your gifts, besides all your vows and all your pledges which you will give to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn510">[39]</xref></sup>However, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you gather the produce of the land, you will celebrate GOD&#x2019;s festival for seven days; on the first day is a day of rest, and on the eighth day is a day of rest. <sup><xref rid="fn511">[40]</xref></sup>You shall lift up for yourselves on the first day, a fruit of the <italic>hadar</italic> tree, branches of date palms, a bough of a myrtle tree, and the brook-willow; and you shall rejoice before GOD, your God, for seven days. <sup>[41]</sup>You will celebrate it as a festival to GOD, seven days in the year; it is a everlasting decree throughout your generations; in the seventh month you will celebrate it. <sup>[42]</sup>You will dwell in the huts for seven days; every citizen within Israel will dwell in the huts. <sup><xref rid="fn512">[43]</xref></sup>So that your generations will know that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in the huts when I took them out of the land of Egypt: I am GOD, your God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn513">[44]</xref></sup>Moshe spoke of GOD&#x2019;s chosen times to the children of Israel.</p>
<p><sup>[24:1]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn514">[2]</xref></sup>Command the Children of Israel: &#x201C;Bring for yourselves pure olive oil, beaten for illumination, to light the lamp always. <sup>[3]</sup>Outside the Partition of the Testimony, in the Tent of Assembly, Aaron will arrange it, from evening till morning before GOD, perpetually; it is an everlasting decree throughout your generations. <sup><xref rid="fn515">[4]</xref></sup>He will prepare the lights in the pure lamp before GOD perpetually.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn516">[5]</xref></sup>Take fine flour and bake in into twelve loaves; each loaf will be two-tenths. <sup><xref rid="fn517">[6]</xref></sup>Set them in two tiers, six to a tier, on the pure table before GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn518">[7]</xref></sup>Put pure frankincense atop the tier. It will be for the bread as a memorial-part, a fire-offering to GOD. <sup>[8]</sup>He will arrange it perpetually before GOD, every Sabbath. It is from the Children of Israel, an everlasting covenant. <sup><xref rid="fn519">[9]</xref></sup>It will belong to Aaron and his family, and they will eat it in a hallowed place, for it is his most holy from GOD&#x2019;s fire-offerings, an eternal portion.&#x201D;</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn520">[10]</xref></sup>The son of an Israelite woman came out (he was the son of an Egyptian man) amid the children of Israel. They quarreled in the camp &#x2014; the son of the Israelitess, and the Israelite man. <sup><xref rid="fn521">[11]</xref></sup>The son of the Israelite woman pronounced the Name and cursed, and they brought him to Moshe. His mother&#x2019;s name was Shlomith, the daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan. <sup><xref rid="fn522">[12]</xref></sup>They set him in the prison, to specify for themselves by the word of GOD.</p>
<p><sup>[13]</sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn523">[14]</xref></sup>Take the one who cursed outside the camp, and all the witnesses will lay their hands on his head; and the entire assembly will stone him. <sup><xref rid="fn524">[15]</xref></sup>Speak to the children of Israel, saying: &#x201C;Whoever curses his Lord will bear his sin. <sup><xref rid="fn525">[16]</xref></sup>If he pronounces the Name of GOD, he will be killed; the entire assembly will stone him. Both the alien and the native shall be put to death for blaspheming the Name. <sup><xref rid="fn526">[17]</xref></sup>A man who kills any other person will be put to death; <sup><xref rid="fn527">[18]</xref></sup>whoever strikes a beast will make restitution for it &#x2014; a soul for a soul. <sup><xref rid="fn528">[19]</xref></sup>A man who gives an injury to his fellowman &#x2014; as he has done, so shall be done to him: <sup><xref rid="fn529">[20]</xref></sup>a fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. As he gives an injury to his fellowman, so it shall be given upon him. <sup><xref rid="fn530">[21]</xref></sup>Whoever strikes a beast must render compensation for it. Whoever strikes a man must be put to death. <sup><xref rid="fn531">[22]</xref></sup>You must have one form of justice for an alien as for the native; for I am GOD, your God.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn532">[23]</xref></sup>Moshe spoke to the children of Israel, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp, and stoned him. The children of Israel did as GOD had commanded Moshe.</p>
<ftnote id="fn431"><bold>[21:1] Speak to the kohanim</bold> After commanding the Children of Israel (including the children of Aaron) to be holy [19:2], Scripture now commands <bold>the children of Aaron</bold> to observe additional restrictions, because they are dedicated to GOD&#x2019;s service. It is also possible that <bold>Speak to the kohanim</bold> means: Teach the kohanim the previous <italic>parasha</italic> &#x2014; because the propagation of the Torah has been entrusted to them &#x2014; whereas <bold>and say to them</bold> refers to the upcoming commandments, which they alone must follow. <bold>with a soul</bold> this means, with a dead person. <bold>defile himself</bold> This verb is in the <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> form. Its <italic>&#x1E6D;et</italic> acquires a <italic>dagesh</italic> because it absorbs the preceding <italic>tav</italic>. <bold>among his people</bold> among all Israel, which is his nation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn432"><bold>[2] except for his nearest kin</bold> We might think that this is a general category, which is then followed by particulars (e.g., <bold>for his mother, for his father</bold>, etc.), as in the phrase &#x201C;No one shall come close to his near kin&#x201D; [18:6]. Furthermore, we might think that the phrase &#x201C;a master among his people&#x201D; [:4] means that the husband may not bury his wife. However, we know the law as the Sages have transmitted it: a kohen <italic>does</italic> bury his wife (the Sages used the word &#x201C;his nearest kin&#x201D; as a means of deriving this exegetically [Yevamot 22b], as I explained in the case of &#x201C;to other people&#x201D; [Exodus 21:8]). Furthermore, the word &#x201C;master&#x201D; denotes not a husband, but a man of substance, with many people in his household (as in, &#x201C;its master was not with it&#x201D; [Exodus 22:13]). Therefore, the original explanation must be invalid. <bold>&#x00B6;His mother</bold> is mentioned before the father, because normally the male of the species outlives the female.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433"><bold>[3] who is near to him</bold> i.e., a full sister, with whom he shares both a father and a mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434"><bold>[4]</bold> Thus, <bold>a master may not defile himself for his household</bold> whether his people be kohanim or ordinary Israelites, except for the abovementioned relatives. <bold>and thereby become unholy</bold> This is an infinitive of the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form. The <italic>lamed</italic> acquires a <italic>dagesh</italic> because it absorbs a second <italic>lamed</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435"><bold>[5] they will not make their heads bald</bold> as a sign of mourning. <bold>they will not shave the corners of their beards</bold> as a sign of mourning &#x2014; for such is the custom in certain areas in Chaldea. The surrounding context here explains the previously-given commandment regarding &#x201C;&#x2026;the corners of your beard&#x201D; [20:27]. <bold>incision</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] that is, not even one. The whole of Israel has already received these commandments [20:27]; but Scripture admonishes the kohanim in particular, to teach us that someone who <italic>does</italic> shave his head, or his beard, or cut his flesh, may not minister before GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436"><bold>[6] so that they will not desecrate the Name of their God</bold> which they are liable to do when they <bold>offer up the fire-offering of</bold> GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437"><bold>[7] a harlot</bold> In all of Scripture we find no instance where the plain meaning of this word is anything other than the literal one &#x2014; even in the case of &#x201C;they have given a boy for a harlot&#x201D; [Joel 4:3], as I have explained. <bold>a profaned woman</bold> but less flagrant than a harlot. According to the plain meaning of the text, it is evident from the words of Ezekiel [Ezekiel 44:22] that a kohen <italic>may</italic> marry a widow &#x2014; at least the widow of another kohen. Thus, the words of the tradition [Qiddushin 78b] are correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438"><bold>[8] You must keep him holy</bold> In your thoughts and in your speech. <bold>the bread of your God</bold> i.e., the food which is offered before GOD. <bold>I</bold>, GOD, <bold>sanctify you</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] i.e., I sanctify <italic>all</italic> of you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><bold>[9] desecrates herself</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>te&#x1E25;el</italic>] Many people say that this word comes from &#x201C;beginning&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>t&#x1E25;illa</italic>]; but I believe it comes from &#x201C;desecration&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>&#x1E25;illul</italic>], except that here the word is in the <italic>hif&#x2018;il</italic> form, as in &#x201C;he may not break his word&#x201D; [Numbers 30:3]. Both opinions require the word to stem from an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin</italic> root, &#x1E25;-l-l. The word, however, is irregular; and it seems likely that the reason for the irregularity, both in the infinitive <italic>ha&#x1E25;el</italic> [the <italic>heh</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>patta&#x1E25;</italic> instead of a <italic>qamma&#x1E63;</italic> &#x2014; Translator] as well as in this word <italic>te&#x1E25;el</italic> (where the <italic>tav</italic> is vocalized with a <italic>&#x1E63;ereh</italic>), is to avoid confusion with &#x201C;beginning&#x201D;, the other meaning of the root. Compare, &#x201C;that it should not be profaned&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>he&#x1E25;el</italic>] [Ezekiel 20:9]. <bold>the daughter&#x2026;of a kohen</bold> who desecrates herself through unchastity &#x2014; since she has desecrated her father&#x2019;s honor &#x2014; <bold>she will be burned</bold> (but only if she was married or betrothed).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440"><bold>[10] the garments</bold> i.e., the holy garments <bold>he will neither let the hair of his head grow, nor will he rend his clothes</bold> from this verse we can derive the laws of mourning, which the Sages, of blessed memory, have transmitted to us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441"><bold>[11] any dead</bold> [<italic>masculine singular</italic>] <bold>people</bold> [<italic>feminine plural</italic>] i.e., the dead <italic>corpse</italic> of any people. The word &#x201C;corpse&#x201D; [<italic>masculine singular</italic>] is implied, since &#x201C;dead&#x201D; is here used as an adjective. Compare, &#x201C;the rich man answers with impudent [words]&#x201D; [Proverbs 18:23] and &#x201C;their food [<italic>masculine</italic>] is a goodly [<italic>feminine</italic>] [lamb]&#x201D; [Habakkuk 1:16], where the word &#x201C;lamb&#x201D; is implied. <bold>he must not enter</bold> into the tent or the house where the corpse lies: not even <bold>for his father or for his mother</bold>, whom he is obligated to honor in their lifetime and in their death, and certainly not for his brother or his son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442"><bold>[12] He must not leave the Sanctuary</bold> The Exegetes correctly interpreted this verse [Sanhedrin 18a] to mean: He will not leave the Sanctuary to follow the funeral procession. Some people interpret the verse literally, and apply it to the seven days of consecration; but this is implausible, because Scripture explicitly discusses the kohen who already &#x201C;has been consecrated&#x201D; [:10].<sup><xref rid="fn533">1</xref></sup></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443"><bold>[13] in her virginity</bold> Certain nouns in the Holy Tongue are never singular, like &#x201C;juvenility&#x201D; [Isaiah 54:6], &#x201C;old age&#x201D; [Genesis 37:3], &#x201C;childhood&#x201D; [<italic>cf</italic>. Isaiah 54:4], and &#x201C;virginity&#x201D; (likewise, certain nouns are never plural, like &#x201C;young children&#x201D; [Esther 3:13], &#x201C;shoulders&#x201D; [Genesis 9:23], &#x201C;gold&#x201D; [Genesis 24:22], and &#x201C;iron&#x201D; [Numbers 35:16]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><bold>[14] a widow, a divorc&#x00E9;e</bold> whether from a kohen, or from a non-kohen. <bold>a profaned woman, [or] a harlot</bold> Scripture omits the connective <italic>vav</italic>, as in &#x201C;the sun [and] the moon stood still&#x201D; [Habakkuk 3:11]. Scripture repeats the restriction <bold>only a virgin</bold> in order to add the qualification <bold>of his people</bold>. He is forbidden to marry a virgin prisoner of war, or a virgin convert.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445"><bold>[15] He must not disqualify his children</bold> by having sexual relations in secret with a widow, or a divorc&#x00E9;e. Thus far, he had only been told not to <italic>marry</italic> such women in public.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446"><bold>[16]</bold> After discussing the holiness of the kohanim, Scripture now lists disqualifying physical defects. The upcoming passage deals with the common kohanim,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447"><bold>[17]</bold> therefore Scripture specifically includes anyone who is descended from Aaron. <bold>the food of his God</bold> denotes any sacrifice offered upon the Altar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448"><bold>[18] sunken-nosed</bold> the opposite of &#x201C;stretched&#x201D;; from &#x1E25;-r-m, meaning &#x201C;extinguish&#x201D;. <bold>stretch-legged</bold> from &#x201C;to stretch himself&#x201D; [Isaiah 28:20].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449"><bold>[20] eyebrowless</bold> An adjective, related to &#x201C;high-peaked hills&#x201D; [Psalms 68:17]. The <italic>nun</italic> forms part of the triliteral root. <bold>dwarf</bold> This word is to be taken literally: i.e., short in stature. <bold>cataract</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>tevallul</italic>] Some say the word denotes destruction, as in &#x201C;they performed a destructive perversion&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>tevel</italic>] [20:12]. Others relate the word to &#x201C;mixed [Hebrew: <italic>belula</italic>] with oil&#x201D; [2:5]. The <italic>tav</italic> is extraneous according to both explanations. <bold>scabies</bold> This also denotes an eye ailment, in many people&#x2019;s opinion. <bold>boil</bold> in the sense of &#x201C;stuck together&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;Samson gripped&#x201D; [Judges 16:29]. Others understand the word in the sense of &#x201C;contortion&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;the man was startled, and turned over&#x201D; [Ruth 3:8]. The <italic>yod</italic> is extraneous, like the <italic>yod</italic> in &#x201C;oil&#x201D; [Numbers 18:12]. <bold>inflated</bold> an adjective, from &#x201C;wind&#x201D;. <bold>testis</bold> i.e., testicle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450"><bold>[21]</bold> After giving specifics, Scripture now states the general rule of <bold>any one with a physical defect</bold>. The phrase <bold>he has a defect</bold> is rhetorical, like &#x201C;he cursed his father or his mother&#x201D; [20:9].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451"><bold>[22] the food of his God</bold> The show-bread, the guilt-offering, and the sin-offering, all of which are most holy compared to the peace-offering, which is also holy. <bold>and of the holy</bold> such as the tithes, and the firstborn animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452"><bold>[23] But he may not approach the Partition</bold> if he is the High Priest; and he may also not approach <bold>the altar.</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453"><bold>[24]</bold> These laws were told to <bold>all the Children of Israel</bold> so that they would not allow a blemished kohen to perform a peace-offering for them (although there are other services which tradition permits such a kohen to perform).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454"><bold>[22:1]</bold> Having mentioned that a kohen with a defect may not eat holy food, Scripture now proceeds to warn the eater that he must also be ritually pure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455"><bold>[2] they must distance themselves</bold> as in, &#x201C;you will keep disassociated&#x201D; [15:31] &#x2014; meaning, to detach himself, in order to draw appropriate distinctions. The verb is in the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form, and comes from &#x201C;Nazirite&#x201D; [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> 25:5]. <bold>and not desecrate</bold> The verb takes a compound object: <bold>they must not desecrate My holy name</bold>, and they must not desecrate <bold>that which they consecrate to Me. I am</bold> GOD Who am holy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456"><bold>[3] cut off from before Me; I am</bold> GOD Whatever is cut off from GOD cannot continue to exist, as I have explained in an earlier place dealing with the mysteries of GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457"><bold>[4] until he becomes ritually pure</bold> after whatever number of days are appropriate in the particular case.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458"><bold>[5] which renders ritual impurity to it</bold> i.e., which renders ritual purity <italic>because of</italic> it. Compare, &#x201C;say for my sake [literally: to me], &#x2018;He is my brother&#x2019;&#x201D; [Genesis 20:13]. &#x00B6;All of the abovementioned events render one ritually impure until evening.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459"><bold>[7] When the sun sets he will be ritually pure</bold> The subject of this sentence is obviously the abovementioned ritually impure man (compare, &#x201C;the kohen will make an atonement for her, and she will be ritually pure&#x201D; [12:8]). The word &#x201C;day&#x201D; is nowhere mentioned in the verse. However, our Sages, of blessed memory, have handed down the law that he should not eat food until <italic>dark</italic> (even after sunset), and they used this verse as a mnemonic by saying &#x201C;the day clears away&#x201D; [literally: the day becomes pure] [Berakhot 2a]. See my comment on the passage &#x201C;to other people&#x201D; [Exodus 21:8] for a similar device [the reference is to an earlier commentary on Exodus, known as the <italic>Perush Haqqa&#x1E63;ar</italic> &#x2014; Translator]. <bold>his bread</bold> i.e., his food, as I have explained elsewhere [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 16:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460"><bold>[8]</bold> Certain brainless people have misinterpreted the verse in Ezekiel that reads &#x201C;The kohanim shall not eat of anything that dies of itself, or is torn, whether it be bird or beast&#x201D; [Ezekiel 44:31]. They claim that the prohibition applies only to food killed <italic>by</italic> birds or by beasts. This is nonsense. The Torah explicitly says, <bold>he must not eat an animal that died by itself, or an animal that was torn</bold> &#x2014; i.e., <italic>any</italic> such animal. This verse teaches us that if he does eat such food, he may not officiate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461"><bold>[9] They will observe My charge</bold> [<italic>feminine</italic>] This alludes to the Sanctuary [<italic>masculine</italic>]. The verse accordingly continues: <bold>and not thereby</bold> [<italic>masculine</italic>] <bold>sin, and not die thereby</bold> [<italic>masculine</italic>].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462"><bold>[10] a stranger</bold> someone not descended from Aaron.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn463"><bold>[11] they</bold> [<italic>masculine plural</italic>] <bold>may eat his food</bold> both the men and the women.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn464"><bold>[12] the holy heave-offering</bold> the thigh and the breast [<italic>cf</italic>. 7:34].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn465"><bold>[13] she may eat of her father&#x2019;s food</bold> just as she could originally. <bold>but no stranger may eat of it</bold> If she has a child, both she and the child fall under the category of <bold>stranger</bold>. She may not eat her father&#x2019;s food, on account of the child.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn466"><bold>[14] he must give it to the kohen as hallowed food</bold> This phrase might be interpreted, &#x201C;<italic>with</italic> the hallowed food&#x201D;. Another possibility is that the verb in the phrase <bold>he must give it to the kohen</bold> takes a compound object, and that &#x201C;it&#x201D; refers back to <bold>a fifth of its value:</bold> He will give it to the kohen, <italic>and</italic> he will give the value of the hallowed food. In my opinion neither interpretation is necessary, because the word <bold>together with it</bold> supplies the appropriate meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn467"><bold>[16] they will incur sin upon others</bold> This transitive verb takes both a direct and an indirect object. The kohanim must instruct the people, so that they do not err.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn468"><bold>[17]</bold> Scripture continues the general topic of the sacrificial offerings, now telling us that a blemished animal may not be sacrificed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn469"><bold>[18] or a resident alien</bold> The laws concerning vows and pledges apply equally to Israel and to aliens, as it is written [Numbers 15:16]. Our Sages have distinguished between a &#x201C;vow&#x201D; and a &#x201C;pledge&#x201D; [Qinnim 1:1]. Every vow eventually becomes a pledge, but not every pledge ultimately becomes a vow.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn477"><bold>[28] cattle or sheep</bold> both male and female animals (see above [<italic>comment on</italic> 11:6]) are included in this commandment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478"><bold>[29] When you slaughter a thanksgiving-offering</bold> which must be eaten in a single day, as opposed to a parent and a child, which may <italic>not</italic> be slaughtered in a single day. This passage adds the word <bold>favorable to you</bold> to that which was previously stated in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>&#x1E62;av</italic> [7:15].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479"><bold>[30] I am</bold> GOD for Whom the thanksgiving-offering should be perfect.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn481"><bold>[32]</bold> It is evident from context that the commandment <bold>Do not desecrate My holy Name</bold> is addressed to the descendants of Aaron. They are the ones whom Scripture enjoins not to slaughter a mother and a child on the same day [:28], whether for themselves or for the Israelites. They are probably also the ones to whom the commandment &#x201C;When you slaughter a thanksgiving-offering&#x2026;&#x201D; [:29] is addressed. The fact that the next passage begins with &#x201C;Tell the children of Israel&#x201D; [23:2] supports the proposition that the current passage is <italic>not</italic> addressed to the children of Israel. Moreover, the phrase <bold>I shall be sanctified among the children of Israel</bold> refers to the Israelites in the third person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482"><bold>[33] Who took you out</bold> &#x2026; <bold>I am</bold> GOD This is the first of the Ten Commandments, and the underlying principle behind all the others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483"><bold>[23:1]</bold> After dealing with the sacrifices, Scripture proceeds to mention the days on which the children of Israel will offer burnt-offerings, beginning with the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484"><bold>[2] these are My chosen times</bold> Scripture employs the plural because there are many Sabbaths in a year [<italic>cf</italic>. :4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485"><bold>[3] it is a Sabbath to</bold> GOD see above [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 16:23]. <bold>in all your settlements</bold> both within your land, and outside your land; both at home, and on the road.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486"><bold>[4]</bold> Scripture now discusses festivals. The Sabbaths were called &#x201C;<italic>My</italic> chosen times&#x201D; [:2]; the festivals are called <bold>their chosen time</bold>, because GOD does not determine the day of the week on which they fall. Allow me at this point to present a few general principles concerning the festivals. &#x00B6;In the days when the Temple still stood, the Sanhedrin determined when the festivals would be held. Consider the case of King Hezekiah&#x2019;s Passover, where Scripture clearly says &#x201C;The king had taken counsel&#x2026;&#x201D; [II Chronicles 30:2].<sup><xref rid="fn534">1</xref></sup> The Exegetes tell us that the Sanhedrin would examine many factors when determining the length of the year. For example, Rabbi <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Aqiba is said to have decreed two [actually three &#x2014; Translator] leap years in a row [Sanhedrin 12a], because the situation required it. &#x00B6;In all of Scripture we find no evidence of the procedure whereby ancient Israel maintained its calendar. Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon claims that they made the calendar conform to the same fixed rules that we now employ; but this cannot be true, as the Mishna and the Talmud both record that Passover occasionally used to fall on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. Two stories tell of the occurrence of such events. Today we add a leap month whenever the lunar year falls approximately one month behind the solar year, but in ancient times this was not the case. &#x00B6;The Jewish calendar began on a Friday morning at 8 o&#x2019;clock (by adding 4 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes and 40 seconds to Sunday night, 11 minutes and 20 seconds past 11 o&#x2019;clock in the evening, we get 8 o&#x2019;clock Friday morning<sup><xref rid="fn535">1</xref></sup>), and the first intercalation occurred one and a half years later. Nowadays, the calendar is based on the average duration of the moon&#x2019;s orbit. Although the interval between two <italic>appearances</italic> of the new moon is &#x201C;sometimes longer and sometimes shorter&#x201D; [Rosh HaShana 25a] than a lunar month, the actual sighting of the moon over Jerusalem (or over any other place) does not occasion the declaration of the new month. To prove this, assume that the midpoints of the sun, moon, and earth are all connected by a straight line. Is Jerusalem necessarily the place where this line intersects the earth&#x2019;s surface? Moreover, whenever we see the new moon of Nisan on a Sunday night &#x2014; and everyone around the world sees the new moon at the same time &#x2014; the month of Nisan does not begin until Monday night. The months of &#x1E6C;evet, Sh<sup>&#x0259;</sup>va&#x1E6D;, and <sup>&#x2283;</sup>Adar can likewise be delayed one day after the sighting of the new moon. This can happen whenever the New Year is delayed two days, because the new moon of Tishrey falls on Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20. There are also occasions when the month of Tishrey begins on Thursday, but the moon remains invisible even as late as Friday night and even if the sky is clear: Whenever the new moon occurs close to midday, the strong light of the sun renders it invisible, because the new moon is always in the same part of the sky as the sun. Even the astronomical moment when the moon is directly between the sun and the earth does not always determine the start of a new month. In particular, the New Year following a leap year is always postponed one day whenever this moment occurs on a Monday morning, after 09:38:16&#x2154;. It is also postponed, as was mentioned earlier, when the moment of collinearity occurs on a Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20. Were it not for my unwillingness to digress, I would explain the mysteries of intercalation, and the little-understood laws regarding a new moon that occurs before midday. The main point is that our Sages, of blessed memory, have transmitted to us the law that in Exile we are to base our calendar completely on a fixed set of rules. This tradition dates back to the time of the prophets, and we cannot improve upon it. &#x00B6;The practice of observing two-day festivals in the lands of Exile originally arose because of uncertainty over when the month began. Nowadays some people fast two days on Yom Kippur, in order to conform both to the calculated New Moon and to the astronomical New Moon. Such fasting does them no good, however, because the New Year is often delayed two days after the new moon appears. Suppose a month &#x201C;ought&#x201D; to begin with the new moon. Whenever the new moon of Tishrey occurs on Tuesday morning, after 03:11:20, then they &#x201C;ought&#x201D; to fast on the eighth day of Tishrey. Thus, why should we subvert the rules which have been handed down to us, for the sake of creating an entirely different calendar? &#x2014; for that is what will happen if we conform our calendar to the sighting of the new moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn487"><bold>[5] in the afternoon</bold> see above [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 12:6]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn488"><bold>[8]</bold> Scripture will give the details of the <bold>fire-offering</bold> in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Pin&#x1E25;as</italic> [Numbers 28:19].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn489"><bold>[10]</bold> The phrase <bold>when you come to the land</bold> is not mentioned until now, because we had to keep the Sabbath even in the wilderness (which is why the passage dealing with the Sabbath [Exodus 35:2&#x2013;3] appears next to the passage dealing with the Tabernacle), and because we observed one Passover at Mount Sinai. <bold>speak to the Children of Israel</bold> for them to assemble; and then, <bold>tell them</bold> the following:</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn490"><bold>[11] the day after the day of rest</bold> [literally: the day after the Sabbath] Our Sages, of blessed memory, have said [Mena&#x1E25;ot 65b] that this denotes the second day of the festival; the Dissenters maintain that the verse should be taken literally. The faithful bring examples from the Sabbatical Year [25:2], the Jubilee, Yom Kippur [:32], and the New Year [:24], all of which are called &#x201C;sabbath&#x201D;. The first and the eighth days of Sukkot are called &#x201C;sabbath&#x201D; [:39], too [<italic>see also comment on</italic> Exodus 31:13]. Moreover, a &#x201C;sabbath&#x201D; also means a &#x201C;week&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;seven sabbaths&#x201D; [:15] as well as &#x201C;those who came in on the Sabbath, along with those who had finished for the week&#x201D; [II Kings 11:9] (where one verse uses two different meanings of the same word<sup><xref rid="fn536">1</xref></sup>). &#x00B6;In addition to these definitive arguments, Meshullam ben Qalonymus of Rome attempted to bring a proof from &#x201C;&#x2026;on the day after the Passover, ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot and toasted grain&#x201D; [Joshua 5:11] without realizing that he thereby weakened his own argument. The Passover sacrifice occurs on the fourteenth of the month; the day after the Passover sacrifice is the <italic>first</italic> day of the festival, as it is written: &#x201C;They marched from Rameses, in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover&#x201D; [Numbers 33:3]. However, the eating of parched grain is forbidden until after the &#x2018;Omer-offering has been waved&#x0021; To resolve this, Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon proposed</ftnote>
<p align="blockquote">1) that there are <italic>two</italic> Passovers: the first is Israel&#x2019;s Passover, while the second is GOD&#x2019;s Passover, and is observed on the evening of the fifteenth. Thus, the reference to &#x201C;the day after Passover&#x201D; in Joshua is a reference to the sixteenth of the month, but the reference to &#x201C;the day after Passover&#x201D; in the Torah denotes the day after the Passover <italic>sacrifice</italic>. This explanation is unsatisfactory, because the Passover festival owes its name to GOD&#x2019;s passing over our houses. &#x201C;The day after&#x201D; that event denotes the following morning &#x2014; which is still the fifteenth (compare, &#x201C;&#x2026;the entire day, the entire night, and the entire day after&#x201D; [Numbers 11:32]).</p>
<p align="blockquote">2) Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon also suggested that the &#x201C;ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot and toast&#x201D; were from the previous year&#x2019;s crop, which makes sense. Scripture says that the waving of the &#x2018;Omer offering takes place &#x201C;from the time when you begin to reap the grain&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:9]. If the waving of the &#x2018;Omer that year occurred on the fifteenth, when did they have time to harvest the grain and prepare ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot? Even if they had had the time, the only harvest so far that year was the beginning of the barley crop. The choice of words is also suggestive: Scripture says, &#x201C;from the land through which they had passed [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;avur</italic>]&#x201D; [Joshua 5:11]; the word may have been used because it describes the produce from the year that had just passed [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;avra</italic>] (&#x201C;the land through which they had passed&#x201D; literally means the land of Si&#x1E25;on and &#x2018;Og). This is borne out by the contrasting phrase, &#x201C;&#x2026;from the fresh produce of the land of Canaan&#x201D; [Joshua 5:12]. Besides, &#x201C;toast&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>qaluy</italic>] is not the same thing as &#x201C;parched grain&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>qalee</italic>]. Scripture states only that &#x201C;You will eat neither bread, nor parched grain [Hebrew: <italic>qalee</italic>], nor kernels&#x201D; [:14]. The verse &#x201C;ripe ears toasted [Hebrew: <italic>qaluy</italic>] in fire&#x201D; [2:14] does not contradict anything we have said, because there the word <italic>qaluy</italic> is used as an adjective. Anything which is &#x201C;toasted&#x201D; in fire can be called &#x201C;toast&#x201D;.</p>
<p>We may press the question still further: What grounds have we to assume that the kohen waved the &#x2018;Omer offering as soon as they crossed the Jordan? In fact, the verse distinctly says &#x201C;the land which I give you&#x201D; [:10] and the land as yet had not been given to them. The entire point of the verse in question is that the manna stopped; Scripture mentions the ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot and the toast only in the context of the stopping of the manna. &#x00B6;Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon also pointed out, that if we are to take the word &#x201C;Sabbath&#x201D; literally, from <italic>which</italic> Sabbath are we to begin the count? Rabbi Abu al-Faraj Furqan ibn Asad replied that there are eighteen days called &#x201C;set times&#x201D;, besides the Sabbath, when an additional sacrifice is offered [Numbers, Chapters 28 and 29]. Since we know that an additional sacrifice is offered on the day the &#x2018;Omer is waved [:12], we can deduce that the day of the &#x2018;Omer waving must be included in the days of the Spring festival. He seems to have forgot, however, that the New Month sacrifices are also not mentioned in the list&#x0021; Moreover, Scripture says, &#x201C;These shall be offered each day for seven days&#x201D; [Numbers 28:24]. According to him, it should say, &#x201C;&#x2026;except for the day on which the &#x2018;Omerwaving falls&#x201D; (the absence of such a phrase poses no problem for <italic>us</italic>, though, because we derive the Commandments from the oral tradition). The <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Pin&#x1E25;as</italic> also does not discuss the lambs of the peace-offering [<italic>cf</italic>. :19] when it comes to the festival of Shavu&#x2018;ot, nor does it say anything about the &#x201C;one young ox, and two rams&#x201D; mentioned in the previous verse [:18] &#x2014; instead, it talks about &#x201C;two &#x2026; bullocks, and one ram&#x201D; [Numbers 28:27]. &#x00B6;The believer can also argue that Moshe knew prophetically that the first day of the month would be a Sabbath, and consequently he would know on what day of the week the &#x2018;Omer waving would fall (just as he would know that the first arrangement of the showbread would occur on a Sabbath [24:8] [<italic>comment on</italic> Exodus 40:2]). Scripture mentions the days on which events fell during the first year; but subsequent years use the terms &#x201C;your Festival of Weeks&#x201D; [Numbers 28:26] and &#x201C;seven weeks&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:9] rather than speaking in terms of &#x201C;Sabbaths&#x201D; [:15]. Similarly, in the first year they offered the sacrifices mentioned here; but in subsequent years they offered the sacrifices in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Pin&#x1E25;as</italic>. &#x00B6;It is useless to say that a &#x201C;week&#x201D; perforce begins on Sunday. The phrase &#x201C;she will be ritually impure for two weeks&#x201D; [12:5] clearly invalidates such an argument. &#x00B6;Most people do not realize that the reason why Scripture does not mention the day on which Shavu&#x2018;ot falls &#x2014; alone among all the festivals &#x2014; is that we are commanded to <italic>count</italic> to the day of the festival. Our Sages, of blessed memory, said [Shabbat 86b] that the day on which Shavu&#x2018;ot falls is the anniversary of the giving of the Torah, and that the statement &#x201C;we have a festival of GOD&#x201D; [Exodus 10:9] is a reference to Shavu&#x2018;ot. <bold>favorable</bold> Some people always translate this as &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D;. In other words, <bold>He will wave the &#x2018;Omer before</bold> GOD <bold>so that it will be acceptable for you</bold> &#x2014; i.e., you wave it for Him to accept it from you. Similarly,</p>
<ftnote id="fn491"><bold>[12]</bold> you shall offer a <bold>yearling</bold> lamb, in order that you may be found acceptable. The Dissenters claim that <bold>yearling</bold> does not mean &#x201C;a year old&#x201D; [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> 12:6]. The former, according to them, denotes an animal under one year of age, whereas the latter denotes an animal one year old or older. The passage dealing with the dedication of the Altar, however, speaks of &#x201C;one yearling lamb&#x201D; [Numbers 7:15], yet in the end gives a total count of &#x201C;twelve one-year lambs&#x201D; [Numbers 7:87].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn492"><bold>[14] bread</bold> from the new crop is forbidden (for the Passover sacrifice is to be eaten &#x201C;with ma&#x1E63;&#x1E63;ot and bitter herbs&#x201D; [Numbers 9:11]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn493"><bold>[15]</bold> Were it not for the tradition, we would think that the counting of the days of the &#x2018;Omer resembles the counting of the years until Jubilee. The Dissenters explain <bold>complete</bold> to mean that we should not count the first Sabbath, but rather that the counting should begin with the day immediately following.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn494"><bold>[16] you shall count fifty days</bold> In Biblical Hebrew, the number given always includes both the first and the last days of the count. Similarly, Scripture always means one week when it uses the phrase &#x201C;on the eighth day&#x201D; [e.g., 12:3].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn495"><bold>[17] you will bring</bold> The <italic>dagesh</italic> in the <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> is peculiar, and no one knows why it is there. <bold>from your settlements</bold> We depend on the tradition [Mena&#x1E25;ot 83b] to elucidate from where the wheat must come, and when it should be offered. <bold>bread for waving</bold> The kohen receives this, along with the lambs of the peace offering [<italic>cf</italic>. :20].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn496"><bold>[18]</bold> It seems that Scripture deviated in the first year from the sacrifices prescribed for subsequent years &#x2014; probably because the first year marked the inauguration of the sacrificial system. Others say that the kohen may bring either a <bold>bull &#x2026; and two rams</bold> or two oxen and &#x201C;one ram&#x201D; [Numbers 28:27], whichever he chooses. No other commandment, however, provides this kind of option. I shall explain the true meaning of the discrepancy in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Pin&#x1E25;as</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> Numbers 28:27].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn497"><bold>[19]</bold> Scripture authorizes us to slaughter peace-offerings on the holiday of Shavu&#x2018;ot, which is a major festival. From here we derive the permissibility of slaughtering peace-offerings on <italic>all</italic> major festivals, contrary to the opinion of the Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn498"><bold>[22]</bold> The commandment of <bold>when you reap the harvest of your land</bold> is mentioned a second time [<italic>cf</italic>. 19:9] apropos the festival of Shavu&#x2018;ot, which involves the first-fruits of the wheat harvest. We must not forget the commandments which pertain to that time of year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn499"><bold>[23]</bold> The phrase GOD <bold>told Moshe</bold> introduces the section on Rosh HaShana, to stress that it is a festival in its own right (as opposed to Shavu&#x2018;ot, which stems from the waving of the &#x2018;Omer). For the same reason, this phrase introduces the sections on Yom Kippur [:26] and the festival of Sukkot [:33].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn500"><bold>[24] the seventh month</bold> The months are counted from Nisan, since that was when we left Egypt. Also, the barley ripening begins a new agricultural year, followed by &#x201C;the first-fruits of the wheat harvest&#x201D; [Exodus 34:22], and followed in turn by &#x201C;when you gather your products&#x201D; [Exodus 23:16]. Each of these festivals must be celebrated on its given day. &#x00B6;Since we normally blow trumpets every month [Numbers 10:10], this day is called <bold>a remembrance of sounding the horn</bold>. Elsewhere it is called &#x201C;a day of sounding the horn&#x201D; [Numbers 29:1], because on this day (as on Yom Kippur of the jubilee year [25:9]) there is a separate commandment to blow the ram&#x2019;s horn. Attend carefully now, and perhaps you shall understand the mysteries which I now reveal. The Exegetes have said that Rosh HaShana is the Day of Judgment, and that the ram&#x2019;s horn reminds us of GOD&#x2019;s majesty. Although every new month is heralded by the blowing of trumpets, the month of Nisan is preeminent over them all. On the first of Nisan the Tabernacle was erected; so it will also be in the future, as Ezekiel says: &#x201C;in the first month, on the first day of the month&#x201D; [Ezekiel 45:18]. He also says, &#x201C;and so shall you do on the seventh day of the month&#x201D; [Ezekiel 45:20] and on that day the sun and the moon are at right angles to one another. The festival on the fifteenth of Nisan occurs when the sun and the moon are directly opposite one another. The seventh day of the festival occurs when the sun and moon are again at right angles to one another. Accordingly, Rosh HaShana is the most important <italic>day</italic> of the year. Although it is a Day of Judgment, one may not fast on it, as Ezra showed us [Nehemiah 8:10]. Yom Kippur comes next, when the Moon is in conjunction with Aquarius, and then comes Sukkot, which is just like Passover except it has eight days instead of seven. Thus the mystery of the festivals and the mystery of the Sabbath are now clarified [not quite &#x2014; Translator].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501"><bold>[27]</bold> Scripture says <bold>However</bold> concerning the holiday <bold>on the tenth</bold> because normally a holiday is a happy day. For example, in Ezra&#x2019;s book we see the phrase &#x201C;go your way, eat sumptuously, and drink sweet beverages&#x201D; [Nehemiah 8:10]. <bold>you shall afflict yourselves</bold> explained above [<italic>comment on</italic> 16:29].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502"><bold>[28] that atones for you</bold> This seemingly redundant phrase means: The day of atonement atones <italic>only</italic> for you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn503"><bold>[29] any person who is not afflicted</bold> The verb is in the passive mood, and this teaches us that someone who is known not to observe this commandment properly must be compelled to fast. We may not labor, so that we will involve ourselves exclusively with repentance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn504"><bold>[30]</bold> There is a difference between <bold>I will cause to be lost</bold> and &#x201C;will be cut off&#x201D; [:29], but I cannot explain it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn505"><bold>[31]</bold> Scripture states <bold>you shall do no work</bold> a second time in order to add the phrase <bold>this is an everlasting decree throughout your generations&#x2026;.</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn506"><bold>[32] keep your Sabbath</bold> Compare this to the Sabbath day, which is not called Israel&#x2019;s Sabbath, but rather GOD&#x2019;s Sabbath [:3].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn507"><bold>[36] for seven days you shall present a fire-offering</bold> Unlike the fire-offering of the Passover holiday, however, these fire-offerings are not all identical. <bold>it is a stoppage</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E63;eret</italic>] Some say this word means &#x201C;assembly&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;an assembly [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E63;eret</italic>] of treacherous men&#x201D; [Jeremiah 9:1] &#x2014; in that all Israel gathers together for the three festivals. This translation is incorrect, because concerning Passover Scripture says, &#x201C;on the seventh day there will be an <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E63;eret</italic>&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:8]; yet earlier Scripture has said, &#x201C;in the morning you may return to your homes&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:7]. It is more plausible to translate the word along the lines of &#x201C;detained [Hebrew: <italic>ne&#x2018;&#x1E63;ar</italic>] before GOD&#x201D; [I Samuel 21:8] to denote a respite from wordly concerns. Accordingly, Scripture says, <bold>it is a stoppage: you will do no servile work</bold>. A similar phrase describes the stoppage on Passover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn508"><bold>[37] These are</bold> GOD<bold>&#x2019;s chosen times</bold> whereon you are required to offer <bold>a fire-offering</bold>. All of the holidays involve <bold>burnt-offerings, grain-offerings, sacrifices and libations</bold>. Thus far only the term <bold>fire-offering</bold> has been mentioned; this term probably denotes either the burnt-offering or the grain-offering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn509"><bold>[38] your gifts</bold> during the three festivals; and also vows (whether they be communal or individual); and also your pledges.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn510"><bold>[39]</bold> Since the previous passage discusses self-affliction, Scripture now uses the word <bold>However</bold> to teach us that it is forbidden to fast on Sukkot, as it is written: &#x201C;you shall rejoice&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:14] and &#x201C;you shall be only happy&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 16:15]. <bold>when you gather the produce of the land</bold> fields as well as vineyards <bold>you will celebrate</bold> This <italic>&#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin</italic> verb refers to the festival peace-offering. <bold>on the first day is a day of rest</bold> The latter word is a predicate nominal; the connective &#x201C;&#x2026;there will be for you&#x2026;&#x201D; is implied (if the latter word were a predicate adjective, then the <italic>heh</italic> of the definite article would replace the preposition <italic>bet</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn511"><bold>[40] you shall lift up for yourselves</bold> We translate according to the words of the Exegetes &#x2014; since they do not contradict the plain meaning of Scripture &#x2014; even though elsewhere we translate &#x201C;every man shall acquire for himself a lamb, for the family group&#x201D; [Exodus 12:3]. The Exegetes have also transmitted to us the tradition that the <bold>fruit of the <italic>hadar</italic> tree</bold> denotes the citron, and, in truth, there is no tree with fruit more beautiful [Hebrew: <italic>hadar</italic>]. They also called it &#x201C;the fruit that resides [Hebrew: <italic>haddar</italic>] on its tree&#x201D; as a kind of mnemonic [Sukka 35a], as I have explained above concerning the passage &#x201C;to other people&#x201D; [Exodus 21:8] [the reference is to an earlier commentary on Exodus, known as the <italic>Perush Haqqa&#x1E63;ar</italic> &#x2014; Translator]. &#x00B6;The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] have said that the Sukka must be built from these four species, bringing a proof from Ezra&#x2019;s book [Nehemiah 8:15]. Didn&#x2019;t these half-wits notice that no mention is made there of the <bold>brook-willow</bold>, nor of any kind of fruit? On the contrary, it is only a list of branches from five kinds of trees (the fact that &#x201C;myrtle branches&#x201D; are mentioned separately from &#x201C;thick-tree branches&#x201D; [Nehemiah 8:15] poses no problem to the traditional interpretation; there are two varieties &#x2014; one tall and one short &#x2014; and there the term &#x201C;myrtle&#x201D; denotes the short variety).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn512"><bold>[43] in huts</bold> After the crossing of the Red Sea they lived in booths (and did so even in the Sinai Desert, where they stayed for nearly a year), following the custom of all military camps. Any perceptive person who travels from Arabia to Edom will understand the reason for this commandment. This festival, like the others, commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. You might ask: Why must this commandment be observed in Tishrey? One possible answer is that although GOD&#x2019;s clouds covered the camp during the day, and protected it from the sun, it was necessary to construct huts on account of the cold from the time of Tishrey onwards.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn513"><bold>[44] to the children of Israel</bold> not literally to <italic>all</italic> the children of Israel, since he could not possibly speak to all of them. The same applies whenever the phrase &#x201C;speak to the children of Israel&#x201D; appears. The verse &#x201C;the entire assembly of the children of Israel&#x201D; [19:2] poses no problem, since the term &#x201C;assembly&#x201D; does not denote the entire nation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn514"><bold>[24:2]</bold> After mentioning the holidays that require a fire-offering [23:37], Scripture must discuss the showbread [:5]. First, however, Scripture interposes the passage of <bold>pure olive oil</bold> because the Lamp stood directly opposite from the bread table.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn515"><bold>[4]</bold> In this passage Scripture inserts the phrase <bold>in the pure lamp</bold> to denote <italic>the</italic> lamp: i.e., the one Be&#x1E63;al&#x2019;el made of pure gold, and no other (the one made of iron in an emergency [<sup>&#x2282;</sup>Avoda Zara 43a] was made at the express instruction of prophets<sup><xref rid="fn537">1</xref></sup>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516"><bold>[5] Take fine flour</bold> i.e., tell someone to take it. Similarly, <bold>bake</bold> also denotes an action to be done through an agent. The word <bold>bake</bold> is irregular, as it is accented on the ultima. The <bold>two tenths</bold> correspond to the</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517"><bold>[6] two tiers</bold>, with the total number of loaves corresponding to the number of tribes (like the Ephod [Exodus 28:9] and the Breastplate [Exodus 28:21]). <bold>on the pure table</bold> as opposed to other tables which might be there. Only this table was covered with gold, and had a golden crown [Exodus 25:24].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn518"><bold>[7]</bold> The frankincense that was with the bread became a <bold>fire-offering to</bold> GOD; the bread itself belonged to the kohen. &#x00B6;This passage probably appears here because the community of Israel has a permanent obligation to offer the holiday burnt-offerings, as well as to supply oil and bread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn519"><bold>[9] to Aaron and his family</bold> [literally: and his sons] i.e., to all the members of his household.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn520"><bold>[10]</bold> There is no known reason why the upcoming passage is included here. Perhaps the blasphemer spoke inappropriately regarding the showbread, or the oil, or the sacrifices. <bold>The son of an Israelite woman came out</bold> from his tent. Compare, &#x201C;they came out and stood at the entrance of their tents&#x201D; [Numbers 16:27]. <bold>the son of an Egyptian man</bold> who had converted to Judaism. <bold>[the] Israelite man</bold> Scripture omits the definite article before the modified noun, as in &#x201C;to [the] rich man&#x201D; [II Samuel 12:4] and &#x201C;[the] seventh day&#x201D; [Genesis 2:3].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn521"><bold>[11] he pronounced</bold> Some translate this word to mean &#x201C;uttered&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;which the mouth of GOD shall express&#x201D; [Isaiah 62:2] and &#x201C;as specified by name&#x201D; [Numbers 1:17]. Others render it along the lines of &#x201C;How shall I curse&#x201D; [Numbers 23:8]. The former explanation strikes me as more plausible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn522"><bold>[12] in the prison</bold> a portion of the campsite which had been so designated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn523"><bold>[14] all the witnesses will lay their hands&#x2026;</bold> because someone may be stoned only by the testimony of witnesses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn524"><bold>[15]</bold> Some people apply the phrase <bold>who curses his Lord</bold> to the case when someone blasphemes secretly. The truth of the matter is that &#x201C;lord&#x201D; is a common noun. Both angels [Judges 13:22] [<italic>comment on</italic> Genesis 3:5] and judges [Exodus 22:27] are called &#x201C;lords&#x201D;. How can one know which meaning the blasphemer intended? However,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn525"><bold>[16]</bold> if he utters the Glorious Name, which is <italic>not</italic> a descriptive name, and cannot be mistaken for a common noun, then it can only denote Him and no one else [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> Exodus 3:15]. Thus the meaning of this verse is: When someone blasphemes, <italic>if</italic> he pronounces the Name, then he is put to death <bold>for blaspheming the Name</bold>. This is what happened in the case of the Egyptian&#x2019;s son. Notice that, out of respect for GOD, the passage on blasphemy does not mention the Name. <bold>the entire assembly</bold> meaning, the leaders of Israel. <bold>both the alien and the native shall be put to death</bold> This leads us to the upcoming passage,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn526"><bold>[17]</bold> which discusses assault (since the two men who fought, above, almost certainly struck one another). Although these laws were given before [Exodus 21:12<italic>ff</italic>], they are repeated here to add the phrase &#x201C;for both the alien and the native&#x201D; [:22]. We begin with the case of one who <bold>kills any other person</bold> deliberately (except in wartime), whether the victim be an alien or a native.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn527"><bold>[18]</bold> However, if he <bold>strikes &#x2026; a beast</bold> then he must only <bold>make restitution</bold>. The phrase <bold>a life for a life</bold> is thus used in two different senses to refer to each of the previous two verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn528"><bold>[19] so shall be done to him</bold> Compare Samson&#x2019;s words: &#x201C;so have I done to them&#x201D; [Judges 15:11] [where the term denotes equivalent, but not equal, compensation &#x2014; Translator]. In addition, Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon has brought numerous other proofs, from simple common sense, that Scripture could not mean</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn529"><bold>[20] a fracture for a fracture</bold> literally. For example, since the original wound was not precisely calculated, how could one duplicate it exactly? If not, and if the wound is in a sensitive area, one might kill the guilty party inadvertently&#x0021; If someone removed one-third, say, of another person&#x2019;s eyelid, how could one possibly give the guilty party precisely that wound? Accordingly, the words of the tradition [Bava Qama 83b] must be correct. The true explanation in all these cases is that the guilty party <italic>deserves</italic> to lose an eye, but instead, he pays its monetary equivalent. If people should ask, &#x201C;what if the guilty party is poor?&#x201D; we answer that the law deals with the cases that are likely to occur. Besides, we can throw the question back at the questioners: What if the guilty party is blind? At least a poor person can conceivably become rich&#x0021; [<italic>see also comment on</italic> Exodus 21:24] <bold>so it shall be given upon him</bold> [literally: with him] [to &#x201C;give upon&#x201D; someone in Hebrew means to fine him &#x2014; Translator]</ftnote>
<ul>
<li>Often, the letter <bold>bet</bold> [&#x201C;with&#x201D;] takes the place of the preposition &#x201C;upon&#x201D;. Compare, &#x201C;upon [literally: with] which I rode&#x201D; [Nehemiah 2:12]. Many other examples exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li><bold>so it shall be given in him</bold> &#x2014; i.e., so shall it be done to him &#x2014; if he does not compensate his victim.</li>
</ul>
<ftnote id="fn530"><bold>[21]</bold> One possible reason why the case of <bold>Whoever strikes a beast</bold> is here repeated, is to include the case when an alien is the victim. The laws of personal injury apply only within the nation of Israel (as it is written: &#x201C;his fellowman&#x201D; [:19]). However, when the case involves killing a person, or killing an animal, then</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn531"><bold>[22] you must have one form of justice for an alien as for the native</bold> [literally: &#x201C;like the alien, like the native&#x201D;]. I have already explained that placing the two words &#x201C;like&#x201D; in parallel construction is a way of speaking concisely. Scripture also employs brevity in the previous verse by not mentioning &#x201C;whoever strikes a man <italic>and kills him</italic> will be put to death&#x201D;. Such a qualifier is unnecessary, since it is obvious that the guilty party is not executed unless the victim dies. &#x00B6;Another possible explanation: Scripture first uses the term &#x201C;strikes fatally&#x201D; [:17] to describe someone who strikes a person in a sensitive area. Later, Scripture gives the general principle that whoever kills another must be executed, whether he struck him in a sensitive area or not. That is why the second instance does not use the word &#x201C;fatally&#x201D;. <bold>your</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>God</bold> The God of the native and the God of the alien.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn532"><bold>[23] The children of Israel did &#x2026;</bold> From that day onwards, they enforced all the laws of personal injury.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn533"><sup>1</sup>It is also plausible that, in any event, he should not leave the Sanctuary except when engaged in the fulfillment of a precept.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn534"><sup>1</sup>Our Sages, of blessed memory, took issue with this action, because a leap month was inserted after the new moon of Nisan had been announced. It is not proper to lengthen a year once Nisan has occurred by inserting a second Nisan [Sanhedrin 12b].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn535"><sup>1</sup>Year 1 of the calendar is imagined to have begun at Sunday night, 11 minutes and 20 seconds past 11 o&#x2019;clock in the evening, even though Year 1 actually consisted only of the five days which preceded the creation of mankind. A single day would be sufficient to require the counting of a new year. We need not concern ourselves with the difference between the solar Year 1 and the lunar Year 1, since the year never existed anyway and is only a harmless mathematical convenience.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn536"><sup>1</sup>Another verse that uses a word in two different ways is &#x201C;He had thirty sons that rode on thirty donkey-colts [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;ayarim</italic>] and they had thirty cities [Hebrew: <italic>&#x2018;ayarim</italic>] &#x2026;&#x201D; [Judges 10:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn537"><sup>1</sup>[The <italic>halakha</italic> [Mena&#x1E25;ot 28a] is that the lamp can be made of any metal; there is also no evidence of prophetic activity in Hashmonean times &#x2014; Translator]</ftnote>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn564">[29]</xref></sup>If a man sells a residential house in a walled city, its redemption shall be until the end of the year of its sale: one year will be its redemption. <sup>[30]</sup>If it is not redeemed before the end of a full year, the house that is in a city that has a wall will remain the permanent possession of the buyer, throughout his generations; it will not revert at jubilee. <sup><xref rid="fn565">[31]</xref></sup>But houses in towns that have no surrounding wall will be considered with the open fields.

<ftnote id="fn538"><bold>[25:1]</bold> The Torah does not always follow chronological order. This passage was given before the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Vayyiqra</italic> and the <italic>parashiyyot</italic> that follow it, since it was said <bold>on Mount Sinai</bold>. It concludes the covenant [26:45] that was mentioned in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Mishpa&#x1E6D;im</italic> [Exodus 24:7]. It appears here, out of order, to connect the laws of incest with the conditions under which the land was given, because incest was one of the things for which the land would vomit them out [18:28].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn539"><bold>[2]</bold> The sabbatical years are the first condition listed (they are also discussed in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Be&#x1E25;uqqotai</italic> [26:34<italic>ff</italic>]). <bold>The land shall be given a rest</bold> An Israelite must not allow a resident alien to sow his field on the Sabbatical year, just as we must not allow him to work on the Sabbath, as long as he is under our control. <bold>the Sabbath of</bold> GOD The Sabbatical year resembles the Sabbath day (this resemblance involves the mystery of the Days of Creation).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn540"><bold>[3] its produce</bold> &#x201C;The land&#x201D;, mentioned in the previous verse, is the antecedent of the possessive pronoun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn541"><bold>[4] A Sabbath of Sabbath</bold> explained above [16:31].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn542"><bold>[5]</bold> It is well known that the word <bold>accretion</bold> is related to &#x201C;add me on&#x201D; [I Samuel 2:36] and that the word <bold>your prohibited [vines]</bold> is related to &#x201C;Nazirite&#x201D; [Numbers 6:2] [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> 15:31, 22:2]. <bold>it is a year of complete rest</bold> i.e., &#x201C;&#x2026;<italic>because</italic> it is a year of complete rest&#x201D;. In other words: You do not own the land during this year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn543"><bold>[6] The fallow of the land</bold> denotes everything that the land yields spontaneously. <bold>for you</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] for everybody. <bold>for you</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] The owner has the same right as everyone else to eat the land&#x2019;s accretion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn544"><bold>[7] your livestock</bold> denotes animals that you own, whereas <bold>wild animals</bold> denotes animals that you do not own.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn545"><bold>[9] you will sound the horn</bold> Opinion is divided over whether the universe was created in Nisan or in Tishrey [Rosh Hashana 10b&#x2013;11a]. We need not dwell on the topic, since the Exegetes have established [Rosh Hashana 27a] that we recite &#x201C;This day, the anniversary of the first day of creation&#x201D; in the Rosh HaShana prayer [<italic>Musaf &#x2018;Amida</italic> for Rosh HaShana]. Moreover, we see in the current verse that one blasts the horn of the jubilee year in Tishrey &#x2014; namely, toward the beginning of the year. We also have the passage &#x201C;Assemble the people&#x2026;&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 31:12] which tells us to read the Torah during the Sukkot festival. There the verse says &#x201C;&#x2026;that they may hear, and that they may learn&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 31:12], and it is unlikely that this should take place after half of the year has elapsed. In addition, Scripture uses such phrases as &#x201C;the harvest festival, at the end of the year&#x201D; [Exodus 23:16] and &#x201C;at the turn of the year&#x201D; [Exodus 34:22]. The definitive proof, however, is the Sabbatical year, regarding which Scripture says, &#x201C;Do not sow&#x201D; [:11]. Now, the sowing season in the land of Israel begins in the month of Mar&#x1E25;eshvan. If the year were to begin in Nisan, then we could not harvest that which we planted in the sixth year. We could not plant on the following year (because it is the Sabbatical year), and since we could not harvest what was sown in the sixth year, it would be for all practical purposes as if we could not sow for two years in a row. Scripture, however, only tells us not to sow during the seventh year. &#x00B6;Y<sup>&#x0259;</sup>hudah HaParsi said that Israel used to follow a solar calendar. If this were true, then Moshe could not have taught us the exact length of a year, concerning which even today&#x2019;s astronomers have been unable to reach an agreement.<sup><xref rid="fn588">1</xref></sup> Not only do we rely on our tradition, but the very etymology of the word &#x201C;month&#x201D; also disproves HaParsi&#x2019;s thesis. The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] claim that a &#x201C;year&#x201D; in our religion is a lunar year; but the term &#x201C;year&#x201D; does not even apply to the moon (just as the term &#x201C;month&#x201D; does not apply to the sun). Rather, by dividing the length of a month into the length of a year, people figured out that a year is approximately 12 months long. The remainder from this division was divided into the length of a lunar month, in order to calculate the fraction of a month left over, so that our months would be lunar months while our years would eventually conform to the solar year. Our Sages, of blessed memory, have accordingly transmitted to us a tradition, dating back to the times of Moshe, that the Sanhedrin must decree seven leap years in every 19-year cycle (even though the months themselves were proclaimed upon observing the new moon). The mysteries of the 19-year cycle can be derived from the science of astrology [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> Exodus 12:2]. <bold>you</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>will blast</bold> The horn must be blown along all the highways.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn546"><bold>[10] you will sanctify the fiftieth year</bold> through the tilling of the soil, and through all its inhabitants. <bold>freedom</bold> This word means &#x201C;liberty&#x201D;. Compare, &#x201C;like a flying swallow&#x201D; [Proverbs 26:2]. The term there denotes a bird which sings as long as it is free; but if it is forced into captivity, it will starve itself to death. <bold>jubilee</bold> [Hebrew: <italic>yovel</italic>] This word means &#x201C;release&#x201D;. Our Sages, of blessed memory, have told us [Rosh HaShana 26a] that the word originally denoted a male lamb (as in, &#x201C;trumpets of ram&#x2019;s horns [Hebrew: <italic>yovlim</italic>]&#x201D; [Joshua 6:4]). The year was named after the horns that announce it. <bold>for you</bold> only for the Israelites. <bold>everyone will return to his estate</bold> In the jubilee year, as will be shortly explained, all sold land reverts to its original owners. <bold>and everyone will return to his family</bold> This applies to any servant who was sold to an Israelite.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn547"><bold>[11] It is jubilee</bold> and since it is the jubilee, <bold>do not sow</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn548"><bold>[12] it will be holy to you</bold> i.e., it is set apart from among the other years. <bold>you may eat of the field</bold> You all may eat the field&#x2019;s spontaneous produce, as it is written concerning the Sabbatical year [:6].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn549"><bold>[13] In this jubilee year</bold> i.e., in the beginning of the year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn550"><bold>[14] buy</bold> This word is a verbal noun. Scripture here employs brevity, instead of supplementing the infinitive with a verb in the indicative mood. The same construction appears in &#x201C;Remember the Sabbath day&#x201D; [Exodus 20:8] as well as in many other places. <bold>If you</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>sell</bold> indicates that witnesses must participate. Similarly, <bold>you</bold> [<italic>plural</italic>] <bold>shall not defraud</bold> is addressed to the witnesses as well &#x2014;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn551"><bold>[15]</bold> you must all terminate the contract after the appropriate number of years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn552"><bold>[16] the price will increase</bold> The verb is the opposite of <bold>decrease</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn553"><bold>[17]</bold> The apparently redundant phrase <bold>Do not defraud one another</bold> serves to warn the seller. The original warning [:14] was addressed to the buyer. <bold>I am</bold> GOD, <bold>your God</bold> Since I am your God, I can exact punishment from the years of whomever defrauds his fellowman. However,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn554"><bold>[18]</bold> if you observe <bold>My statutes</bold>, then</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn555"><bold>[19]</bold> the land will yield <bold>its produce</bold>. This reward is singled out, because Scripture is discussing the produce of the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn556"><bold>[20]</bold> The Sadducees [a derogatory reference to Karaites &#x2014; Translator] claim that the word <bold>our produce</bold> proves that the year begins in Nisan. This proof is invalid, because here <bold>our produce</bold> almost certainly denotes what the land produces on its own. Should they assert that spontaneous yield is called &#x201C;accretion&#x201D; [:5], and not &#x201C;produce&#x201D;, one can rebut them with &#x201C;you may eat of the field&#x2019;s produce&#x201D; [:12]. Besides, if they are correct, let them tell us how to treat the jubilee year. According to them, one may not then sow during the sixth year, nor during the seventh year, nor during the eighth year &#x2014; we could begin to sow only at the end of the ninth year, and harvest it in the tenth year&#x0021; If so,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn557"><bold>[21]</bold> then why does this verse mention only <bold>three years</bold>? The correct interpretation of <bold>it will yield produce&#x2026;</bold>, in my opinion, is: I shall extend My blessing on the sixth year, that there will be not only enough for that year, but also enough for an additional year; and during the jubilee year, there will be enough for three years, but no more. &#x00B6;The word <bold>it will yield</bold> is irregular, like &#x201C;ministering to the king&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>m<sup>&#x0259;</sup>sharat</italic>] [I Kings 1:15]. Of two consecutive <italic>tav</italic>&#x2019;s, one is elided for the sake of euphony.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn558"><bold>[22] old</bold> [<italic>masculine</italic>] This word is the object of the preposition <bold>from</bold>, and here functions as a substantive. Compare, &#x201C;from the ark-cover [<italic>feminine</italic>] you shall make the Cherubim on its [<italic>masculine</italic>] two ends&#x201D; [Exodus 25:19].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn559"><bold>[23] permanent ownership</bold> From &#x201C;GOD our God shall cut them off&#x201D; [Psalms 94:23]. The <italic>tav</italic> is part of the triliteral root (as in &#x201C;divorce&#x201D; [Hebrew: <italic>kritut</italic>] [Deuteronomy 24:1]). The fundamental reason for these laws is that <bold>the land is Mine</bold>. Moshe himself said in his prayer, &#x201C;GOD, you have been our dwelling place&#x201D; [Psalms 90:1]. In other words: You are like an eternal dwelling place, into which &#x201C;one generation passes away, and another generation comes&#x201D; [Ecclesiastes 1:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn560"><bold>[24] the land of your possession</bold> includes the Amorite lands as well as your inheritance in the land of Canaan.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn561"><bold>[25] becomes poor</bold> This verb is an example of the so-called biliteral root; the middle consonant of the root has disappeared. It means &#x201C;poor&#x201D; or &#x201C;impoverished&#x201D;. <bold>close relative</bold> i.e., closely related.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562"><bold>[27] calculate</bold> a verb in the <italic>pi&#x2018;el</italic> form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563"><bold>[28] it shall go out</bold> The abovementioned &#x201C;estate&#x201D; is the subject of the verb. Scripture employs metonymy, as in many other places, and uses a concrete noun to represent an attribute of the noun. Since Scripture goes on to discuss</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564"><bold>[29] a residential house</bold>, we know that the passage &#x201C;&#x2026;and sells from his inheritance&#x201D; [:25] refers to a field, or a vineyard. <bold>a walled city</bold> surrounded by a wall. <bold>one year</bold> [literally: days] The word denotes a year &#x2014; until the days go through the cycle from cold to warm, summer and winter, returning to the way they were originally (with the sun in approximately the same location). We require the tradition [<sup>&#x2282;</sup>Arakhin 31a] to define a complete year &#x2014; whether it is a solar year, or a lunar year, or a lunar leap year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn565"><bold>[31] considered with</bold> [literally: on] <bold>the open fields</bold> &#x201C;On&#x201D; here means &#x201C;with&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;the men came with [literally: on] the women&#x201D; [Exodus 35:22]. <bold>it</bold> [<italic>singular</italic>] <bold>shall be redeemable</bold> i.e, each and every house may be redeemed (compare, &#x201C;branches [<italic>plural</italic>] that run [<italic>singular</italic>] over the wall&#x201D; [Genesis 49:22] and &#x201C;&#x2026;for her children [<italic>plural</italic>], because he [<italic>singular</italic>] is not&#x201D; [Jeremiah 31:14]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn566"><bold>[32] eternal redemption</bold> i.e., permanent redemption. After mentioning the permanent right of redemption, Scripture uses the same word when it says</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn567"><bold>[33] whoever redeems from the Levites;</bold> but here the word simply means &#x201C;to buy&#x201D; (others say that the choice of words teaches us that the house may be redeemed even from a Levite buyer). The <italic>vav</italic> in <bold>expires</bold> is like the <italic>f</italic> of Arabic. The same laws apply to a single <bold>house</bold> as to an entire <bold>city</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn568"><bold>[35] his fortune drops</bold> From &#x201C;He shall not waver&#x201D; [Psalms 112:6]. The <italic>mem</italic> is part of the triliteral root. Compare, &#x201C;when I said, &#x2018;my foot slips&#x2019; &#x201D; [Psalms 94:18]. <bold>your brother</bold> i.e., an Israelite. <bold>with you</bold> You are obligated to help when he is with you, and when you are aware of him. <bold>you must support him</bold> This metaphor is the opposite of <bold>his fortune drops:</bold> you must keep him from falling. <bold>a foreign resident</bold> The above commandment applies to your own countryman; but even if he is a foreign resident, <bold>he will live</bold> with you (the verb is in the future tense).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn569"><bold>[36] interest or usury</bold> The Oral Tradition defines these terms precisely [Bava M<sup>&#x0259;</sup>&#x1E63;i&#x2018;a 60b], and Scripture elaborates their meaning in the following verse. <bold>Usury</bold>, from &#x201C;excessive&#x201D; [e.g., Genesis 13:6], stems from a <italic>lamed-heh</italic> verb. The <italic>tav</italic> is extraneous, as in &#x201C;deceit&#x201D; [Zephaniah 3:13] and &#x201C;perfect hatred&#x201D; [Psalms 139:22].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn570"><bold>[37]</bold> The <italic>mem</italic> in <bold>usury</bold> is also extraneous, like the <italic>mem</italic> in &#x201C;ornament&#x201D; [Leviticus 26:1].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn571"><bold>[38]</bold> Scripture now says <bold>I am</bold> GOD, <bold>your God, Who took you out of the land of Egypt</bold> as if to say, &#x201C;you were foreigners, and now I have given you an inheritance&#x201D;. This concept is related to &#x201C;if a foreign resident, he will live with you&#x201D; [:35] as well as to the previous passage, which discusses land redemption. Moreover, the entire passage of &#x201C;if his fortune drops&#x2026;&#x201D; [:35] appears where it does on account of the law that if an Israelite in great need sells himself as a slave, he must go free at the Jubilee. Thus, all of the passages in this section are interrelated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn572"><bold>[39] is sold to you</bold> whether he sold himself, or whether he stole something from you and was sold by the Court.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn573"><bold>[40] he will serve with you until the jubilee &#x2026;</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn574"><bold>[41] then he will leave you, he and his children</bold> The Sages have transmitted the tradition [Qiddushin 21b] that these verses apply to the slave of whom it was said &#x201C;he shall serve him forever&#x201D; [Exodus 21:6].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn575"><bold>[42] they are My servants</bold> because I acquired them from the slavehouse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn576"><bold>[43] hard labor</bold> This word should be rendered along the lines of the Aramaic translation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn577"><bold>[44] from the nations around you</bold> e.g., <sup>&#x2282;</sup>Ammon, Mo&#x2019;av, &#x2019;Edom, and <sup>&#x2283;</sup>Aram.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn578"><bold>[45] and also from the children of the settlers</bold> who now live in your land (the land of Canaan), but who were originally from the abovementioned nations, or Egypt, or any nation except the Seven Nations. Regarding the latter Scripture says, &#x201C;you must not spare any soul&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 20:16]. Since it is forbidden even to feed them, it is almost certain that when our Sages, of blessed memory, use the term &#x201C;Canaanite slave&#x201D; [Qiddushin 22b] they meant someone who lives in the land of Canaan but who is not of Canaanite lineage. On the other hand, possibly they knew the true meaning of these verses to be other than their literal meaning &#x2014; for our understanding is feeble compared to theirs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn579"><bold>[46] bequeath</bold> a <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> verb with a transitive sense, like &#x201C;you shall draw&#x201D; [Numbers 34:10]. <bold>you will always hold them in service</bold> i.e., it is <italic>permissible</italic>. Our Sages, however, of blessed memory, have told us [Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in 38b] that it is <italic>obligatory</italic>; and we accept what they say. <bold>but your brothers, the children of Israel</bold> You should distinguish between your brother and a foreigner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn580"><bold>[47] transplanted</bold> that is, &#x201C;rooted&#x201D; &#x2014; someone of Gentile ancestry who has adopted the religion of Israel. This word has no cognate, but it is the opposite of &#x201C;uproot you&#x201D; [Psalms 52:7]. See also &#x201C;you shall hamstring their horses&#x201D; [Joshua 11:6].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn581"><bold>[49] or he may obtain the means</bold> He could find a lost object, or he could inherit property from a dead relative. Nevertheless, Scripture first speaks of his brother and his family, because that is the more usual case.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn582"><bold>[50] his buyer</bold> This word, with a <italic>heh</italic>, means the same as it does without a <italic>heh</italic>. <bold>when he was sold</bold> a verbal noun in the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form. The years when he was with his buyer are considered <bold>like the years of a hired servant.</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn583"><bold>[51] he will accordingly repay the redemption [money]</bold> He will calculate for him the appropriate proportion of the original purchase price. <bold>if there are still many years &#x2026;</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn584"><bold>[52] if there are few years</bold> In other words, &#x201C;Regardless of whether the remaining years are many or few &#x2026;&#x201D;. The <italic>vav</italic> connecting these two clauses is like the Arabic <italic>f</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn585"><bold>[53]</bold> Scripture repeats <bold>like an annual workhand</bold> in order to add <bold>he will not oppress him with hard labor, in your sight</bold>. This means that we may not allow a foreigner to oppress him with hard labor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn586"><bold>[54] If he is not thereby redeemed</bold> &#x201C;Thereby&#x201D; denotes the years remaining until the Jubilee (some say that it denotes the abovementioned redeemers [:48-49]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn587"><bold>[55]</bold> The current use of the phrase <bold>the children of Israel are My servants</bold> [<italic>cf</italic>. :42] is addressed to the foreigner who buys an Israeli slave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn588"><sup>1</sup>The scholars of India add 12 minutes to 365&#x00BC; days. Ptolemy, on the other hand, and his colleagues, subtract 4 minutes and 48 seconds from 365&#x00BC; days. This amount is quite close to the solar year (but more recent scientists have proposed subtracting 1/106 of a day, while others have proposed 1/110, 1/130, or 1/180 of a day). These differences arise because the former astronomers calculate the sidereal year &#x2014; from the moment when the sun is in conjunction with some star to the moment when the sun is next in conjunction with the same star. Other astronomers base their calculations on the angle of the ecliptic.</ftnote>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn635">[27:1]</xref></sup>GOD told Moshe: <sup><xref rid="fn636">[2]</xref></sup>Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them: &#x201C;If a man expresses a vow with the valuation of animate things to GOD: <sup><xref rid="fn637">[3]</xref></sup>The valuation of the male from twenty years of age to sixty years of age &#x2014; the valuation is fifty silver shekels of the holy shekels; <sup>[4]</sup>if it is a female, the valuation is thirty shekels. <sup><xref rid="fn638">[5]</xref></sup>If from five years of age to twenty years of age &#x2014; the valuation of the male is twenty shekels; for the female, ten shekels. <sup>[6]</sup>From the age of a month to the age of five years &#x2014; the valuation of the male is five silver shekels; for the female the valuation is three silver shekels. <sup>[7]</sup>If from sixty years of age and upward &#x2014; if a male, the valuation is fifteen shekels; for the female, ten shekels. <sup><xref rid="fn639">[8]</xref></sup>If he is too poor for the valuation, he will present him before the kohen, and the kohen will assess him. According to what the vower can afford the kohen will assess him.</p>
<p><sup>[9]</sup>If it is a beast from which they may bring a sacrifice to GOD, everything which he gives therefrom to GOD will be holy. <sup>[10]</sup>He must not exchange it, nor may he replace it: neither good with bad nor bad with good. If he does replace one beast with another beast, it and its replacement will be holy. <sup>[11]</sup>If it is any ritually impure beast, from which they may not bring a sacrifice to GOD, he will present the beast before the kohen. <sup>[12]</sup>The kohen will assess it, whether good or bad; as the valuation of the kohen, so shall it be. <sup>[13]</sup>If he redeems it, he will add a fifth to the valuation. <sup><xref rid="fn640">[14]</xref></sup>If a man dedicates his house to be holy to GOD, the kohen will assess it, whether good or bad; as the kohen assesses it, so it will be fixed. <sup>[15]</sup>If the dedicator redeems his house, he will add to it a fifth of the money of its valuation, and it will be his. <sup><xref rid="fn641">[16]</xref></sup>If a man dedicates from his hereditary land to GOD, the assessment will be according to its crop. A crop of a <italic>&#x1E25;omer</italic> of barley corresponds to fifty silver shekels. <sup><xref rid="fn642">[17]</xref></sup>If from the jubilee year he dedicates his field, it will be fixed at its valuation. <sup><xref rid="fn643">[18]</xref></sup>If he dedicates his field after the jubilee, the kohen will reckon the money for him according to the years remaining till the jubilee year, and subtracted from the valuation. <sup><xref rid="fn644">[19]</xref></sup>If the man who dedicates it redeems the land, he will add to it a fifth of its valuation, and it will become his. <sup><xref rid="fn645">[20]</xref></sup>If he does not redeem it, and if it was sold to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. <sup><xref rid="fn646">[21]</xref></sup>When the land goes out at jubilee, it will be holy to GOD, like a dedicated field; his estate will belong to the kohen. <sup>[22]</sup>If he dedicates land that he bought, which is not of his hereditary estate, to GOD, <sup><xref rid="fn647">[23]</xref></sup>the kohen will reckon for him the amount of the valuation until the year of the jubilee. He will pay the assessment on that day, holy to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn648">[24]</xref></sup>In the jubilee year the land will return to the one from whom he bought it, to the one to whom it belongs as inherited land. <sup>[25]</sup>All valuations will be in holy shekels, twenty gerahs to the shekel. <sup><xref rid="fn649">[26]</xref></sup>However, a firstling beast, which is first-born to GOD &#x2014; no man will dedicate it; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it belongs to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn650">[27]</xref></sup>If of the ritually impure beast, it will be redeemed at the valuation, and he will add to it its fifth. If it is not redeemed, it will be sold at valuation. <sup><xref rid="fn651">[28]</xref></sup>However, anything dedicated, which a man may dedicate to GOD from anything that is his &#x2014; from a person, or a beast, or from a field of his estate &#x2014; will not be sold or redeemed. Anything dedicated is most holy to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn652">[29]</xref></sup>The ban of any person, who will be banned, will not be ransomed. He will be put to death. <sup>[30]</sup>Every tithe of the land &#x2014; from the grain of the land, from the fruit of the tree &#x2014; belongs to GOD, is holy to GOD. <sup>[31]</sup>If a man does redeem a part of his tithe, he will add its fifth to it. <sup><xref rid="fn653">[32]</xref></sup>Every tithe of cattle, or of the flock &#x2014; everything that passes under the rod: The tenth will be consecrated to GOD. <sup><xref rid="fn654">[33]</xref></sup>He must not discriminate between good and bad, nor will he replace it. If he does replace it, it and its replacement will be holy. It cannot be redeemed.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn655">[34]</xref></sup>These are the commandments that GOD commanded Moshe to the Children of Israel, on Mount Sinai.</p>
<ftnote id="fn589"><bold>[26:1] monument</bold> for the abovementioned <bold>graven image</bold> (the meaning of which is known). <bold>ornament</bold> a noun, like the word &#x201C;usury&#x201D; [25:37]. It denotes a painted stone, from &#x201C;they have more than the heart can describe&#x201D; [Psalms 73:7] and &#x201C;delightful craftsmanship&#x201D; [Isaiah 2:16]. <bold>do not place in your land</bold> which is how Mercury was generally worshiped [Sanhedrin 60b]. <bold>for I am</bold> GOD, <bold>your God</bold> and it is I to whom you must prostrate yourselves (as it is rendered in the Aramaic translation of Jerusalem [no such translation is known &#x2014; Translator]). <bold>&#x00B6;do not make idols for yourselves</bold> Scripture has repeated its admonition against idolatry, since one might be sold to a Gentile. One may not service one&#x2019;s masters&#x2019; idol,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn590"><bold>[2]</bold> nor may one serve one&#x2019;s masters on the Sabbath, though the foreigner may have bought him for that purpose. <bold>revere My sanctuary</bold> One must go to the Sanctuary on the three festivals. The sense of these verses is probably: Do not make idols for yourselves, since &#x201C;they are My servants&#x201D; (which was just stated prior to this); and since they are My servants, they must serve Me alone and no others. The injunction to <bold>observe My sabbaths</bold> also includes the Sabbatical years; while <bold>revere My sanctuary</bold> also denotes the jubilee year, as it is written, &#x201C;it will be sanctified by you&#x201D; [25:12]. In my opinion, &#x201C;observe my sabbaths&#x201D; is mentioned on account of having mentioned &#x201C;to prostrate yourselves upon it&#x201D; [:1], along the lines of &#x201C;every Sabbath, all flesh shall come to bow to the ground before me&#x201D; [Isaiah 66:23]. In other words: You must come every Sabbath to prostrate yourselves before Me &#x2014; not on some ornamental stone, but only in My sanctuary. Thus, Scripture mentions the choice day (which was chosen for the service of GOD, as I have explained [<italic>comment on</italic> Genesis 2:3]), as well as the choice place. <bold>I am</bold> GOD Who rested from all labor on the Sabbath, and Whose Glory resides in the Sanctuary, and for Whose sake <bold>you shall revere</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn591"><bold>[3] If you follow My laws &#x2026; observe, and practice &#x2026;</bold> We are required to <italic>study</italic> and to <italic>teach</italic> as well as to <italic>do</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn592"><bold>[4]</bold> The <italic>vav</italic> in <bold>I will provide</bold> is like the <italic>vav</italic> in &#x201C;the earth was formless and empty&#x201D; [Genesis 1:2]. &#x00B6;A verb with a <italic>vav</italic> that is accented on the ultima is always in the future tense; if it is accented on the penultimate it is in the past tense, with very few exceptions. <bold>its produce</bold> from &#x201C;the mountains bring him food&#x201D; [Job 40:20]. It is not known whether the <italic>yod</italic> is part of the triliteral root, or whether, like the word &#x201C;living creature&#x201D; [<italic>cf</italic>. Genesis 7:4], it is not part of the triliteral root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn593"><bold>[5]</bold> The phrase <bold>threshing will last until vintage</bold> indicates that the phrase &#x201C;when you gather your products from the field&#x201D; [Exodus 23:16] applies to the vineyard as well. <bold>to satiety</bold> a verbal noun. The word <bold>securely</bold>, like the word &#x201C;alone&#x201D; [Numbers 23:9], means the same thing both with and without a <italic>lamed</italic>. Scripture mentions satiety before security because it is fundamental. <bold>you shall dwell in security</bold> for in times of famine, people wander from their homes (compare, &#x201C;it will not henceforth yield its produce for you; a fugitive and a wanderer will you be&#x201D; [Genesis 4:12]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn594"><bold>[6] I will provide peace in the land</bold> among yourselves <bold>and none will frighten you</bold> neither wild beast nor enemy; rather,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn595"><bold>[7]</bold> you will pursue the enemy, and he will fall before you. The wonder will be that</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn596"><bold>[8]</bold> a small number of you will pursue a large number of enemies. I have already explained in <italic>Sefer Moznayyim</italic> that the words &#x201C;ten&#x201D;, &#x201C;hundred&#x201D;, &#x201C;thousand&#x201D;, and &#x201C;myriad&#x201D; (ten thousands) are approximate quantities. It is customary to exaggerate numbers by multiplying them by ten, as in &#x201C;now you are worth all ten thousand of us&#x201D; [II Samuel 18:3]. Here Scripture exceeds this custom &#x2014; five people pursuing one hundred people involves twice the usual proportion. Moreover, each of a hundred people will himself be able to pursue a hundred people.<sup><xref rid="fn656">1</xref></sup> Scripture repeats <bold>your enemies will fall</bold> to convey that they will fall one after another, and not get up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn597"><bold>[9] I shall turn to you</bold> i.e., by increasing your wealth; and also by making you fruitful, and by increasing you with sons and daughters. In my opinion, the word <bold>I shall make you fruitful</bold> is the opposite of &#x201C;the barren womb&#x201D; [Proverbs 30:16]. <bold>I will fulfill My covenant with you</bold> that you be &#x201C;as many as the stars in heaven&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 1:10] and &#x201C;as the dust of the earth&#x201D; [Genesis 13:16].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn598"><bold>[10] you will eat from the old, aged harvest</bold> The wonder will be &#x2014; despite your great numbers &#x2014; that whoever wants to will be able to eat <bold>old</bold> produce, or produce <bold>aged</bold> even further than the old produce (the word is in the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form). Some people will have to take the old crop out of their houses before the new crop, because there will no room to store it (one commentator has said that <bold>you will clear out</bold> denotes taking it out into the field).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn599"><bold>[11] I will place my Habitation</bold> Do not fear that you will ever come to lack, for My Glory will dwell with you, and I am not like a person who loathes always to remain in the same place. Also, when you travel to the land of your enemies, even if the Sanctuary is not among you,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn600"><bold>[12]</bold> My Glory will walk amid you. Thus, I will be <bold>God</bold> to you, and you will be My nation;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn601"><bold>[13]</bold> and it is for this reason that <bold>I brought you out of the land of Egypt. the traces of your yoke</bold> Scripture compares Israel to a plowing bull who works his master&#x2019;s land. Israel, in fact, was enslaved through the building of the land (for so it is written [Exodus 1:11]). <bold>upright</bold> bearing an erect posture.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn602"><bold>[14]</bold> Certain empty-headed people have said that the curses are more numerous than the blessings. This is untrue. Rather, the blessings are given in general terms, whereas the curses are given in detail in order to impress and to frighten the listeners. If you read carefully, what I have said will become evident. <bold>all the commandments</bold> the ones mentioned above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn603"><bold>[15] nullifying</bold> This is an irregular word. Verbal nouns often deviate from the normal construction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn604"><bold>[16] I shall command upon you</bold> like a man in command of another, who can have his will with him. <bold>confusion, the <italic>sha&#x1E25;efet</italic>, and the <italic>qadda&#x1E25;at</italic></bold> These are known illnesses. The connecting preposition here has the sense of &#x201C;with&#x201D;. <bold>Confusion</bold> means, you will be confused and will not know what to do (although some say that <bold>confusion</bold> means &#x201C;suddenly&#x201D;). Many people have drawn the conclusion, without cause, that <bold><italic>sha&#x1E25;efet</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>qadda&#x1E25;at</italic></bold> are both plant diseases (similar to &#x201C;blasting&#x201D; and &#x201C;mildew&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 28:22], which are known from Scriptural context [Amos 4:9] to be plant diseases), on account of the phrase <bold>you will sow in vain</bold>. The actual meaning is that they will contract illnesses; then, when enemies come to their villages and eat their grain, no one will be able to go out against them and drive them away. <bold>destroying the eyes&#x2026;</bold> These illnesses will darken the eyes and distress the soul. The phrase <bold>distress the soul</bold>, like the phrase &#x201C;a liar gives ear&#x2026;&#x201D; [Proverbs 17:4], is missing an <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic>. Some people say that the word <bold>eyes</bold> represents the entire body, because it is followed by the contrasting phrase <bold>which distress the soul;</bold> but this interpretation is groundless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn605"><bold>[17] I will turn My anger</bold> [literally: My face] this means, My wrath, My anger (as in &#x201C;her ill disposition [literally: her face] was no longer with her&#x201D; [I Samuel 1:18]). Those who survive the diseases will be defeated if they go out in battle against their enemies. They will even flee when no one pursues them, in the way of the Aramean camp [II Kings 7:7].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn606"><bold>[18] if after these</bold> i.e., if after these catastrophes. <bold>seven</bold> a round number, often used simply to denote &#x201C;many&#x201D; (as in, &#x201C;a just man falls seven times, and yet rises up again&#x201D; [Proverbs 24:16] and &#x201C;the barren has born seven&#x201D; [I Samuel 2:5]). Scripture does not imply that God will return sevenfold <bold>for your sins;</bold> rather, He will <bold>continue</bold> with yet another punishment (as in, &#x201C;a mighty voice, that has not continued&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 5:19]). <bold>above your sins</bold> i.e., because of your sins. Some people incorrectly say that the number <bold>seven</bold></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn607"><bold>[19]</bold> is to be taken literally. If we consider <bold>I will destroy</bold> to be One; <bold>your skies like iron</bold>, Two; <bold>your land like brass,</bold> &#x201C;will go to waste&#x201D; [:20], the produce of the land, and the fruit of the trees &#x2014; we have only six. We would need to add the plague of &#x201C;wild animal&#x201D; [:22] to obtain a total of seven. <bold>the pride of your strength</bold> prosperity (as in, &#x201C;Yeshurun grew fat&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 32:15]). Pride, once it is shattered, plummets into humiliation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn608"><bold>[20] Your efforts will go to waste</bold> whereby you toiled in working the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn609"><bold>[21] stubbornness</bold> Although this word has no cognate, many people agree that it denotes boldness, contention, strengthening of resolve and dismissal of fear, so as not to be vanquished. Others relate the word to &#x201C;all that had happened&#x201D; [Genesis 42:29]. They interpret the word along the lines of the Philistines&#x2019; statement, &#x201C;It is not His hand that smote us: it was a happenstance&#x201D; [I Samuel 6:9]. Both explanations either require an implied &#x201C;with&#x201D; (as in &#x201C;[within] six days&#x201D; [Exodus 20:11]), or else the sentence means, &#x201C;if you walk [the ways of] stubbornness against me&#x201D;. I have shown you many similar sentences. Note that Scripture here says <bold>corresponding to your sins</bold> &#x2014; which means that He will not exceed their magnitude &#x2014; whereas the previous phrase &#x201C;above your sins&#x201D; [:18] modified &#x201C;to punish you&#x201D; [:18] and means &#x201C;<italic>because of</italic> your sins&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn610"><bold>[22] I will send upon you</bold> compare, &#x201C;I will send upon you&#x201D; [Exodus 8:17]. <bold>bereave you</bold> through the killing of children <bold>diminish your numbers</bold> through the killing of adults <bold>your roads will become desolate</bold> for no way will be free from the fear of wild animals (i.e., animals unowned by any man, as I have explained [<italic>comment on</italic> 25:7]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn611"><bold>[23] you will not subject yourselves</bold> The future tense of a <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612"><bold>[24] upon your sins</bold> This phrase modifies the verb <bold>I will smite you</bold> [and not the adverb &#x201C;sevenfold&#x201D;; <italic>cf. comments on</italic> :18, :21].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn613"><bold>[25] retribution for the covenant</bold> Concerning this, I have already said [<italic>comment on</italic> 25:1] that the covenant herein mentioned was the one ratified at Sinai and mentioned in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>Mishpa&#x1E6D;im</italic>. When Israel accepted it upon themselves, saying, &#x201C;we will do, and we will obey&#x201D; [Exodus 24:7] the covenant was then ratified, and all of this <italic>parasha</italic> was given. <bold>you will gather within your cities</bold> on account of the sword; but I will send epidemics and famine there, until you will want to be captured by the enemy &#x2014; that is, <bold>you will be</bold> voluntarily <bold>given into the enemy&#x2019;s hands</bold> (the verb is in the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn614"><bold>[26] When I break your bread supply</bold> The verb is in the infinitive form, vocalized with a <italic>&#x1E25;iriq</italic> as in &#x201C;when she lay down, or when she arose&#x201D; [Genesis 19:33]. Scripture uses the verb &#x201C;to break&#x201D; because &#x201C;supply&#x201D; is here figuratively called a &#x201C;staff&#x201D;. Similarly, Isaiah speaks of &#x201C;the support of bread&#x201D; [Isaiah 3:1] because &#x201C;bread strengthens man&#x2019;s heart&#x201D; [Psalms 104:15]. <bold>ten women</bold> a round number. It was the custom in Israel for every household to bake in its own oven enough bread for the week. The arrangement of loaves on the Sabbath [24:8] provides evidence for this practice. <bold>will divide your bread by weight</bold> because it will be so meager. <bold>you will eat and not be satisfied</bold> Hunger normally abates after one has eaten a little, but you will not be satisfied even with great amounts of food.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn615"><bold>[27] if through this</bold> i.e., if through this calamity (similarly, &#x201C;if through these&#x201D; [:23] means, &#x201C;if through these calamities&#x201D; &#x2014; the ones that have been mentioned).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn616"><bold>[28]</bold> The phrase <bold>upon your sins</bold> modifies the verb <bold>I will punish you</bold> [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> :24].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn617"><bold>[29] you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters</bold> This is the most extreme stage of a famine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn618"><bold>[30]</bold> You will have no place to cry out and to pray for deliverance from the famine, for I shall destroy <bold>your altars</bold> (the places where you offer your sacrifices). <bold>sun-temples</bold> houses built for sun-worship, from &#x201C;sun&#x201D; [Job 30:28]. The <italic>nun</italic> is extraneous, like the <italic>nun</italic> in &#x201C;compassionate women&#x201D; [Lamentations 4:10]. <bold>your corpses</bold> i.e., your bodies, as in &#x201C;a trampled carcass&#x201D; [Isaiah 14:19]. &#x201C;Idols&#x201D; is a derogatory term for idol-worship, from &#x201C;as one removes dung&#x201D; [I Kings 14:10]. The sense of the verse is: You will be killed as you gather together in the houses of idol worship; your enemies will destroy the images of your useless idols, while I shall not save you. <bold>I will loathe you</bold> This means either that the Divine Presence will depart, or that</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn619"><bold>[31] your cities</bold> will be devastated and your sanctuaries &#x2014; which were once My sanctuaries &#x2014; will be destroyed. <bold>I will not smell the odor of your offerings</bold> Although GOD&#x2019;s Glory fills the heavens and the earth, Scripture here speaks metaphorically and means, &#x201C;I will no longer accept your burnt offerings&#x201D;. Similarly, concerning Noah Scripture says, &#x201C;GOD smelled the pleasing odor&#x201D; [Genesis 8:21]. After mentioning <bold>your cities</bold> and <bold>your sanctuaries</bold>,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn620"><bold>[32]</bold> Scripture proceeds to mention <bold>the land</bold> &#x2014; i.e., the entire land of Israel. <bold>will be astounded by it</bold> The destruction will be so vast that it will astound even the occupying enemies (the opposite of &#x201C;&#x2026;the rejoicing of the whole earth&#x201D; [Lamentations 2:15]).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn621"><bold>[33] I will scatter</bold> a verb in the <italic>pi&#x2018;el</italic> form. Not only will you be scattered, but I will also draw the sword against you. <bold>I will draw</bold> [Hebrew: I will empty] from its sheath. <bold>your land will be desolate</bold> This phrase is connected to the subsequent verse, so as to read, &#x201C;<italic>When</italic> your <bold>land</bold> will be <bold>desolate</bold>, <italic>then</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn622"><bold>[34] the land will appease&#x2026;&#x201D;</bold> (the latter verb means &#x201C;repay&#x201D;, as in &#x201C;as a hireling, he shall fulfill his day&#x201D; [Job 14:6] and &#x201C;her iniquity has been repayed&#x201D; [Isaiah 40:2]). <bold>its Sabbaths</bold> the Sabbatical and the jubilee years. Compare, &#x201C;until the land has made good her Sabbaths&#x201D; [II Chronicles 36:21], as I have there explained. <bold>its desolation</bold> a noun. The formation of nouns is often irregular. <bold>all the days of its desolation, and your stay in your enemies&#x2019; land</bold> When the land is desolate of you it will rest, and find respite, to make up for its Sabbatical years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn623"><bold>[35] it will rest all the days of its desolation</bold> it will rest an amount of time equivalent to the number of years owed, as explained in Ezekiel [Ezekiel 4:5&#x2013;6].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn624"><bold>[36]</bold> Scripture mentions <bold>those of you who survive</bold> because it previously said &#x201C;I will draw the sword against you&#x201D; [:33]. <bold>faintness</bold> an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin</italic> verb (like &#x201C;lifting up their hands&#x201D; [Nehemiah 8:6]), from &#x201C;fainthearted&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 20:8]. They will be so afraid that <bold>the sound of rustling leaves</bold> will put them to flight. <bold>rustling</bold> an adjective, from a verb in the <italic>nif&#x2018;al</italic> form. The <italic>nun</italic> of the triliteral root is absorbed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn625"><bold>[37] one another</bold> [literally: each upon his brother] each upon his friend. <bold>standing</bold> The presence of the <italic>tav</italic> indicates that this is the <italic>hif&#x2018;il</italic> form of an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-vav</italic> verb, like &#x201C;donation&#x201D; [Exodus 25:2].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn626"><bold>[38] will consume you</bold> Whenever people are exiled to another place, where the air and the water are different, they normally die in great numbers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn627"><bold>[39] the survivers</bold> i.e., some among the survivers. <bold>will weaken</bold> an <italic>&#x2018;ayin-&#x2018;ayin</italic> verb (like &#x201C;turned&#x201D; [Ezekiel 1:9]), from &#x201C;his flesh shall consume away&#x201D; [Zechariah 14:12] and &#x201C;there shall be a stench&#x201D; [Isaiah 3:24]. <bold>they will even weaken for the sins of their fathers among them</bold> compare, &#x201C;our fathers have sinned&#x201D; [Lamentations 5:7], as I have explained in the Book of Lamentations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn628"><bold>[40] they will confess</bold> a verb in the <italic>hitpa&#x2018;el</italic> form. Although <bold>their fathers</bold> committed <bold>their faithlessness, in being faithless to Me;</bold> it was the sons themselves who <bold>even trespassed against Me</bold> and acted <bold>with stubbornness</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn629"><bold>[41] Even I&#x2026;</bold> i.e., So have I done with them: I have punished them by bringing them into <bold>their enemies&#x2019;</bold> land, until <bold>their uncircumsized heart</bold> capitulated, as I shall further explain. They shall <bold>repay their sin</bold> means, they shall make restitution, they will be punished for it [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> :34].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn630"><bold>[42] I will recall My covenant</bold> The object of the verb is also connected to the phrase that follows it, in the sense of, &#x201C;My covenant, the covenant of Ya&#x2018;aqov&#x201D;. Compare, &#x201C;the prophesy that was the prophesy of &#x2018;Oded the prophet&#x201D; (literally, &#x201C;the prophesy &#x2018;Oded the prophet&#x201D;) [II Chronicles 15:8] and &#x201C;your chiefs, the chiefs of your tribes&#x201D; (literally, &#x201C;your chiefs of your tribes&#x201D;) [Deuteronomy 29:9]. Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon said that Scripture begins first with Ya&#x2018;aqov, because he was party to the covenant all of his life.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn631"><bold>[43] the land will be forsaken without them</bold> i.e., I will recall the land, which has made restitution for its Sabbaths, and which was forsaken without them; and I will also recall that they have repaid <bold>their sin. because and because</bold> The first corresponds to <bold>they have rejected My precepts</bold> while the second corresponds to <bold>they have loathed My decrees</bold>. The <italic>bet</italic> is extraneous, like the <italic>bet</italic> of &#x201C;at first&#x201D; [Genesis 13:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn632"><bold>[44] even although</bold> A stylistic embellishment, since one adverb would have sufficed. Similar constructions appear throughout Scripture, like &#x201C;only but with Moshe&#x201D; [Numbers 12:2] and &#x201C;for want of no graves&#x201D; [Exodus 14:11]. <bold>I will not reject them &#x2026; to annihilate them</bold> only to punish them, until their hearts will capitulate [<italic>cf</italic>. :41]. <bold>loathe them</bold> turn away from them, or abhor them. <bold>to break My covenant</bold> which I have sworn to them &#x2014; even though <italic>they</italic> have broken My covenant, as it is written [:15] &#x2014; I shall not break My covenant with them, for <bold>I am</bold> God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn633"><bold>[45] I will</bold> forever <bold>remember of them the original covenant</bold> i.e., the covenant that was ratified at Sinai. The people there are called the <bold>original</bold> generation, as opposed to the descendants who were exiled to the land of their enemies (some say that the term denotes the forefathers; in that case, <bold>which I brought out</bold> must perforce mean, &#x201C;those of whom I swore to their forefathers that I would bring their children out of slavery&#x201D; &#x2014; but the former interpretation, in my opinion, is correct).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn634"><bold>[46] These are the decrees and the precepts</bold> The ones that are written in the <italic>parashiyyot</italic> of <italic>Yitro</italic> and <italic>Mishpa&#x1E6D;im</italic> as well as in the <italic>parasha</italic> of <italic>B<sup>&#x0259;</sup>har</italic>. <bold>which</bold> GOD <bold>gave, between Him and the children of Israel</bold> This alludes to the covenant at Mount Sinai, since Moshe ceased ascending Mount Sinai once the Sanctuary was made and the Glory entered the Tent of Assembly. For the same reason, Scripture now mentions</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn635"><bold>[27:1]</bold> the passage of valuations &#x2014; on account of its having been said on Mount Sinai (for so it is written at the end [:34]) &#x2014; unlike the next book, which begins with &#x201C;GOD spoke to Moshe in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Assembly&#x201D; [Numbers 1:1] like the beginning of the book of <italic>Vayyiqra</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn636"><bold>[2] expresses</bold> i.e., specifies, makes clear. <bold>the valuation of animate things</bold> This involves a case where someone takes a vow, saying, &#x201C;If GOD will do such-and-such for me, I will redeem my soul with its valuation&#x201D; (or his son&#x2019;s valuation, or the valuation of an animal, etc). &#x00B6;All the grammarians agree that the <italic>khaf</italic> is extraneous, and that the word means &#x201C;valuation&#x201D;. One opinion, however, holds that the <italic>khaf</italic> indicates the second person masculine singular possessive and denotes the kohen. &#x201C;As the valuation of the kohen&#x201D; [:12] would then be explained to read, &#x201C;as your valuation, of you&#x201D;, and the <italic>heh</italic> would be classified as a vocative <italic>heh</italic>. Similarly, &#x201C;the valuation&#x201D; [:23] must perforce be an irregular word, like &#x201C;within my tent&#x201D; [literally: within the my tent] [Joshua 7:21]. In my opinion, however, the latter word means, &#x201C;the tent, which was my tent&#x201D;. The same argument can apply to &#x201C;the your valuation&#x201D;. <bold>animate</bold> which includes both people and animals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn637"><bold>[3] from twenty years</bold> beginning with the age when one enters into the census. <bold>sixty</bold> when one becomes old. The opinion of many is that these laws are simply unexplained decrees. Thus</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn638"><bold>[5]</bold> from the age of one month until the age of five years, one must give five <italic>sheqalim</italic> &#x2014; even for someone only one day older than one month, one must give five <italic>sheqalim</italic>. Sa&#x2018;adya Gaon believed, however, that one must give one <italic>sheqel</italic> for every year of age, up till and including the age of five. Nevertheless, the majority opinion is that there are four fixed valuations (corresponding to the four stages of a person&#x2019;s life). The second stage extends up to and including the age of nineteen, and the third stage extends up to and including the age of fifty-nine. Within each of these stages, one&#x2019;s valuation always remains at the same level it assumed at the beginning of the stage. The fourth stage lasts roughly fifteen years, giving a total of seventy-five years for the four stages of life. &#x00B6;The truth is that one passes from each stage to the next at the exact number of years specified [<sup>&#x2282;</sup>Arakhin 18a]. One might entertain the supposition, however, that the passing of a single day in a year is as good as the passing of a year [e.g., Rosh HaShana 2b]. We need not depend on the tradition alone to refute this idea &#x2014; we can simply point out, Why would it then be necessary to specify a lower limit of one month in the one month to five year interval? &#x00B6;The period until five years, and the period until twenty years, might lead one to conclude that a man&#x2019;s valuation goes up one <italic>sheqel</italic> every year until the age of sixty, at which point his valuation begins to decrease. One can answer the &#x201C;one month&#x201D; argument within the context of this supposition by stating simply that a person younger than one month has no valuation. However, what can one say about the period over sixty years? Does one continue to decrease the valuation <italic>ad infinitum</italic>? &#x00B6;Clearly, all of these alternate explanations are erroneous. The laws must be understood as Scriptural decrees. For this reason we cannot expect a consistent proportion between the valuation of a male and that of a female. After the age of sixty, the male valuation exceeds the female valuation by one-third; between the ages of five and twenty, the male exceeds the female by one half; from one month till five years, and also from twenty years to sixty years, the male exceeds the female by two-fifths.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn639"><bold>[8] will assess</bold> the person being assessed, and the one paying the assessment, are jointly evaluated. The word is related to &#x201C;concerning You, there is no reckoning&#x201D; [Psalms 40:6], but here it is in the <italic>hif&#x2018;il</italic> form (as in <bold>the kohen will assess him</bold>), in order to differentiate its meaning from that of &#x201C;he will arrange it before GOD&#x201D; [24:8]. <bold>he will present him</bold> either</ftnote>
<ul>
<li>&#x201C;The kohen&#x201D; is the subject of this verb, as if Scripture had said, &#x201C;the kohen will present him before the kohen&#x201D; (i.e., before himself). I have explained the phrase &#x201C;he will pour some on the kohen&#x2019;s left palm&#x201D; [14:15] along similar lines. This construction conforms to Hebrew usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>The person who vowed is the subject of the verb, and he presents himself before the kohen.</li>
</ul>
<ftnote id="fn640"><bold>[14] it will be fixed</bold> meaning, it will remain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn641"><bold>[16] from his hereditary land</bold> within the territory that the nation of Israel has inherited. <bold>a <italic>&#x1E25;omer</italic> of barley</bold> Scripture states elsewhere [Ezekiel 45:11] that there are exactly ten <italic>batim</italic> in a <italic>&#x1E25;omer</italic>. In the same place, a <italic>bat</italic> is said to be equivalent to an <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic>. Thus, land seeded with an <italic>&#x2019;efa</italic> of barley would be valued at five <italic>sheqalim</italic>. This too is a decree of the King, concerning the wealth of His servant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn642"><bold>[17] if from the jubilee year</bold> within the year itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn643"><bold>[18] will be subtracted from the valuation</bold> &#x201C;The time that has passed since the jubilee&#x201D; is the implied subject of the verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn644"><bold>[19]</bold> The <italic>vav</italic> in <bold>if he redeems</bold> here functions like the Arabic <italic>f</italic>. The verse is a continuation of the previous verses, since Scripture is primarily discussing valuation &#x2014; in the case when the field is redeemed, and</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn645"><bold>[20]</bold> in the case when the field is not redeemed. <bold>and if it was sold</bold> i.e., <italic>or</italic> if it was sold, the hereditary owner of the field may no longer redeem it. Once they sell it, it is consecrated to GOD.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn646"><bold>[21] when it goes out at the jubilee</bold> Scripture now mentions that the field leaves its buyer at the jubilee, the same as any other field. <bold>like a dedicated field</bold> When someone vows to consecrate his field, it also goes to the kohen. Here, in addition, the monetary valuation of the property goes <bold>to the kohen</bold> &#x2014; that is, to the one who made the original valuation (he need <italic>not</italic> be the High Priest).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn647"><bold>[23] the amount</bold> as in &#x201C;the number of persons&#x201D; [Exodus 12:4].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn648"><bold>[24] the one from whom he bought it</bold> this is the original seller, as Scripture subsequently explains: <bold>to the one to whom it belongs as hereditary land</bold>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn649"><bold>[26] consecrated as a first-offering</bold> It is already known that it belongs to GOD (the verb is in the passive mood). This verse discusses the case when someone declares, &#x201C;I will donate this first-born to GOD&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn650"><bold>[27] if</bold> the abovementioned first-born is <bold>of a ritually impure beast, it will be redeemed at the valuation</bold> plus an additional one-fifth, since he consecrated it. He may alternatively give a lamb (for so it is written [Exodus 13:12&#x2013;13]), if he does not consecrate it, or if it was sold. In the case of a firstling donkey [Exodus 13:13], he must give the valuation, <italic>and</italic> a lamb, although many people disagree [the <italic>halakha</italic>, in fact, is that a firstling donkey can be redeemed either with a lamb, or with money [Bekhorot 11a] &#x2014; Translator].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn651"><bold>[28] from anything that is his</bold> i.e., anything under his control. <bold>a person</bold> compare, &#x201C;I will consecrate their cities&#x201D; [Numbers 21:2].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn652"><bold>[29]</bold> The verb <bold>will be banned</bold> is in the passive mood, like &#x201C;will be stood up alive&#x201D; [16:10].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn653"><bold>[32] under the rod</bold> the shepherd&#x2019;s rod. The animals selected for GOD are: 1) the first-born, and 2) every tenth animal. The two categories have equal status, except that the latter, unlike the firstborn, can be redeemed. Thus, a man must donate his firstborn, as well as one-tenth of his livestock &#x2014; just as he must donate his firstfruits [Exodus 23:19] and a tithe [Deuteronomy 14:22] of all edible vegetable products.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn654"><bold>[33] discriminate</bold> meaning, &#x201C;distinguish&#x201D;. I have already explained [<italic>comment on</italic> Genesis 1:5] that this word is related to &#x201C;morning&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn655"><bold>[34]</bold> I have already explained <bold>on Mount Sinai</bold> earlier in this <italic>parasha</italic> [<italic>comment on</italic> 26:46]. Whoever has a mind to understand the mysteries of the universe, will grasp the inner meaning of the first-born, and of the tithes [<italic>cf. comment on</italic> Exodus 20:14]. Abraham practiced tithe-giving [Genesis 14:20] as did our father Ya&#x2018;aqov, may he rest in peace [Genesis 28:22]. I shall reveal somewhat more of this mystery when I discuss the Second Tithe [<italic>comment on</italic> Deuteronomy 14:22], with the help of the One to Whom there is no second.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656"><sup>1</sup> Certain people offer the explanation that when individuals are united, each can pursue a greater number. They apply this explanation to the verse &#x201C;how could one chase a thousand&#x2026;&#x201D; [Deuteronomy 32:30]. But there is no need to take things so literally.</ftnote>
